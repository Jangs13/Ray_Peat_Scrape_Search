LA ESTRUCTURA COMO SISTEMA REGULATORIO, \nUNA URGENTE VISIÓN DE LA OMNIPRESENTE EPIGÉNESIS  I. INTRODUCCIÓN   La \ntoxicidad de los estrógenos y de las grasas \nno saturadas ha sido conocido durante todo \nel siglo XX, y se ha aprendido mucho acerca de sus interacciones en \nel proceso de envejecimiento.  El organismo, durante \ntodo este tiempo, ha sido entendido como una interacción dinámica \nde las influencias*tróficas celulares que \nregulan la forma y función. * Mi argumento es que algunos \nde nuestros adaptativos y protectores procesos de regulación, son anulados \npor la presencia excesiva de grasas no saturadas - con el apoyo de algunas \notras toxinas - en nuestra dieta, actuando como una  falsa señal, \ny que el colesterol, Pregnenolona , y la progesterona, \nsiendo nuestras principales defensas de largo alcance, son superadas \npor los efectos de las grasas no saturadas; que la cascada de reacciones \nineficaces y defectuosas (con inclusión de diversos procesos del Estrógeno) \nlleva a bajar cada vez más la producción de energía, la reducción \nde la función , y en extremo la muerte.   En \nciertos momentos, especialmente en la infancia y la vejez, el hierro \n(que también tiene importantes funciones de regulación) se acumula \nhasta el punto de que sus funciones \nde señalización pueden ser inapropiadas.  También está relacionado \ncon los estrógenos y grasas no saturadas \nde manera que podría pasarse de la moderación y adaptación \na una repentina  auto-destrucción, la \ndenominada muerte celular apoptótica.   Si \nnos fijamos en el organismo humano a partir de una \núnica-total perspectiva, parece coherente e inteligible, pero desde \nla perspectiva de la doctrina establecida \npor la actual Academia Biológica, parece terriblemente complejo, carece \nde cualquier principio de integración visible; \n como resultado de una visión mecánica, \nsimplista, farmacéutica, o de ideas religiosas \nque cada vez más se ofrecen a llenar \ndicho vacío.  Sin embargo, los datos experimentales pueden \nser sacados de la confusión, y darles una coherencia. En lo que sigue, \nvoy a actuar como si las doctrinas de \ndeterminismo genético y la regulación de las membranas \nfueran meras reliquias históricas.  La aparición de \nSistemas de control son ahora lo suficientemente claros \ncomo para empezar a utilizarlos en la inversión \nde la enfermedades degenerativas: Alzheimer, demencia, epilepsia, artritis, \nosteoporosis, depresión, hipertensión, el endurecimiento arterial \ny de los vasos sanguíneos, la diabetes y algunos tipos de \ntumor, inmunodeficiencias, reflejo de los problemas, en especial atróficos, \nincluida la limpieza de depósitos de amiloide y mucoide. Creo que muchas personas experimentan \nregeneración cuando muchas circunstancias actúan correctamente, en \nsinergia; por ejemplo, irse de viaje a las montañas en \nprimavera con amigos puede optimizar los sistemas reguladores básicos II.  ELEMENTOS COMUNES EN LAS LESIONES CEREBRALES \nDURANTE EL CRECIMIENTO Y EL ENVEJECIMIENTO.  La mayoría de las personas \nse sorprenden por el número de células en el cerebro prenatal, \nasí como en el encéfalo envejecido: En el feto humano \nen sus 6 meses de desarrollo, hay aproximadamente el doble de células \nque en el momento del nacimiento, y, en la vejez, el número de células \ncerebrales sigue aumentando, de modo que a la edad de 90 la cantidad \nde ADN en el cerebro (36,94 gramos) es de aproximadamente 50% mayor \nque a la edad de 16-20 (23,04 gramos)  \nEn un cerebro de avanzada edad, las \n*células gliales se multiplican mientras \nlas neuronas mueren.  *El sistema nervioso está \nconstituido por dos tipos celulares básicos: las neuronas y las células gliales. El \nconjunto de células gliales conforma la denominada neuroglía . Además de desempeñar la función \nde soporte de las neuronas, intervienen activamente en el procesamiento \ncerebral de la información .  En el feto, las células que mueren son aparentemente las \n                   \ncélulas nerviosas que aún no han madurado. Los factores que se sabe \nque reducen el tamaño del cerebro en el momento del nacimiento son \ntambién factores que están implicados en la degeneración del cerebro \nen la vejez o la enfermedad de Alzheimer: la falta de oxígeno, el exceso \nde grasas no saturadas o deficiencia de las grasas saturadas, el exceso \nde estrógenos, la deficiencia de progesterona, y la falta de glucosa. \nLa falta de dióxido de carbono es probablemente perjudicial en ambos, \nprenatal y anciano.   Inflamación y coágulos de sangre pueden ser factores en el envejecimiento \ndel cerebro, y el sangrado con espasmo vascular es a veces un factor \nque contribuye a daño cerebral, tanto en el \nviejo como en el encéfalo fetal.  La Endotoxemia \nquizás sea un importante factor en la degeneración nerviosa \nsólo durante la vida adulta, pero a veces se presentan durante el embarazo.  Free Press, NY, 1988.  C. Finch and L. Hayflick, Handbook of the Biology \nof Aging.  Van \nNostrand Reinhold, NY, 1977. III.  UNA VISIÓN DE \nLA ENTROPÍA: RENOVACIÓN DEL CEREBRO Cuando un óvulo fertilizado \nse está convirtiendo en una persona, de cada división celular \nse crea un nuevo entorno para las células hijas, que deben adaptarse.  Éstas \ndeben recorrer límites y resistencias (a veces un determinado gen no \nresponde a la necesidad de la situación, o \nhay toxinas que están presentes, o los nutrientes y las hormonas \nno están perfectamente suministrados), pero el proceso es flexible, \nencontrando maneras de solventar dichas limitaciones.  El \ndesarrollo del cerebro en el embrión es mi ejemplo favorito de \nlos caminos por las que los genes interactúan con el medio ambiente.  Podemos \npensar en el \"óptimo desarrollo del cerebro\" de una persona, \no una rata o un pollo, como algo que está claramente limitado por \"los \ngenes\". Pero si \na las ratas, por ejemplo, se les da un ambiente estimulante, cada generación \ntiene un desarrollo un poco más grande, un poco más inteligente su \nencéfalo. Si las ratas son tratadas durante el embarazo para aumentar \nsu cantidad de progesterona, las crías tienen cerebros más grandes \ny aprenden de manera más eficiente.  Aunque podríamos pensar que éste es \nel restablecimiento de una condición que era natural para las ratas \nen ambiente técnicamente perfectos.  Con otro ejemplo, \nlos pollos se desarrollan dentro de \nla cáscara de huevo, de forma que \nlos nutrientes necesarios para su desarrollo están \ntodos presentes cuando la gallina pone el huevo.  Por todo esto , el cerebro, al igual que los otros órganos, \ncuando deja de crecer la oferta de alimentos \nse agota.  Sin embargo, un experimentador (Zamenhof) \nabrió las cáscaras de huevo en la etapa de desarrollo cuando el encéfalo \nestanca su crecimiento, y les añadió glucosa, encontrando \nque el cerebro continuaba creciendo, \ndesarrollando pollos con cerebros más grandes.  Los \"genes\" de un pollo, como \nparte de un sistema, tienen algo que ver con el desarrollo de éste, \npero estos genes, este sistema existen en \nun ambiente dado, y todo el organismo en sí es capaz de orientar y \napoyar la forma en que el sistema se desarrolla.  El tamaño, la \ncomplejidad y la inteligencia del cerebro representa una parte muy importante \nde la \"información\" que figura en el organismo, y \nel experimento de Zamenhof demostró que la capacidad para hacer realidad \neste potencial, la creación de esta complejidad, viene del apoyo del \nambiente, y que \"la naturaleza genética del pollo\" no constituye \nun límite para el desarrollo de su cerebro.   Voy a argumentar que la enfermedad de Alzheimer \nes análoga a la situación de confrontación \nen el desarrollo de embriones de pollo o de la rata o \nde un feto humano, cuando el entorno no es capaz de satisfacer \nlas  exigentes y sensibles células del cerebro y las células cerebrales \nempiezan a morir; en lugar de transformarse en estados más complejos, \nyendo más allá de los diversos obstáculos y limitaciones.  Hay dos estereotipos que están en conflicto \ncon este punto de vista: (1) Que la estructura del cerebro se determina \nen un punto temprano de la vida, a veces explícitamente \na la edad de 12 o 16 años, y (2) que la estructura del cerebro entra \nen un deterioro \"entrópico\" durante el proceso de envejecimiento.  Mi \npostura es que las células del cerebro \nestán en un proceso de desarrollo en todo momento, y que las mismas \ncosas que dañan el cerebro de un feto \npueden también lesionar el cerebro \nde la persona que va envejeciendo. Si una novedad \naparece durante el desarrollo, entonces es difícil sostener que \"la \nentropía aumenta\" durante el desarrollo de un individuo. ¿Acaso \nno es un niño una organización más rica que un óvulo fertilizado?  ¿No \nes un adulto más individualizado o independiente que un niño?.  Visto desde el interior, nuestro conocimiento del mundo se hace más \nrico con la experiencia.  El aprendizaje es, sin duda, anti-entrópico.¿De dónde viene la idea de \"la vida aumenta la \nentropía\"?  Muchas circunstancias contribuyen a esta visión, entre ellos \nla doctrina del determinismo genético, la vieja idea platónica de \nla imperfección de lo concreto, la irrealidad de lo existente, y la \nidea medieval del \"cuerpo corrupto.\"  Estas filosofías aún \nguían a algunos individuos en la investigación del envejecimiento.   El astrofísico, NA Kozyrev, puso de manifiesto \nque la idea de un \"universo entrópico\" deriva simplemente \nde las hipótesis de los Deísmos del \n siglo 19,  aquellas cuyo axioma sostiene que \"Dios configuró \nel universo en movimiento mecánico, y \nlo dejó en funcionamiento...\"   A principios de este siglo, Raymond Pearl \nsostuvo que la \"Tasa de Vida\" rige la \nduración de esta, a fin de que \"vivir rápido\" significa \nuna corta vida.  Basó su argumento en las semillas de melón: \nel que más rápido creció, fue así mismo el primero en morir.  Esto \nfue porque no les dio otra cosa excepto agua, \npor lo que estos melones tuvieron que vivir de su energía almacenada, \nasí, si crecían rápidamente, obviamente, se quedaban sin esa \nenergía almacenada antes.  Nunca he oído que \nlo haya descrito como una idea absurda, pero creo que \nen ocasiones la cortesía se lleva \ndemasiado lejos.  En la analogía del reloj, o \nla analogía de las semillas, la energía disponible se ha agotado.  El \nreloj con su varianza primaveral y las semillas en un plato de agua \npueden ser considerados como sistemas cerrados, y podemos comprender \nsu destino  Pero si es absurdo \nextrapolar de una semilla olvidada \nen un laboratorio a los organismos en un \nambiente libre, entonces , es igualmente absurdo \nextrapolar a partir de un reloj analógico un cosmos.   Desafortunadamente, estas inferencias acerca \nde los sistemas cerrados se aplican a menudo a situaciones reales que \nno son energéticamente cerradas.  La teoría de la edad en función de \"la tasa de vida recogió \nla idea del envejecimiento como una propiedad física natural del tiempo, \ny le dio una expresión matemática, con el argumento (Hershey, \"Entropía, \nel metabolismo basal y la esperanza de vida,\" Gerontología 7, \n245 -- 250, 1963) que \"la producción de entropía en la totalidad \nde la duración vital\" puede ser calculada, para dar idea de \"la \nesperanza de vida y desarrollo evolutivo\".  Lamentablemente, la ecuación \nque empleó Hershey supone que el flujo de calor \nexterno al cuerpo es reversible.  Esto sugiere \nla imagen del Dr. Frankenstein reviviendo \na su monstruo con un relámpago, poniendo de nuevo en el calor del cuerpo.  Si el calor se va a \"volver a poner \nen el cuerpo,\" será pues, necesario asegurarse de que es conveniente \npara dicha estructura tal como ésta existe  En realidad, es justamente el flujo de energía dirigida \nla que genera las estructuras. Si cualquier argumento biológico puede \nelaborarse a partir de la idea de la entropía, es que sería muy difícil \nde generar alimentos poniendo calor en una persona   En algunas situaciones, es \ndemostrable que las estructuras vivas pueden absorber directamente el \ncalor de su entorno (lo que provoca la caída de la temperatura)- este \nproceso es denominado \"producción \nnegativa de calor\" - pero el significado exacto de \neste proceso aún no está claro. (Abbott BC, et al., \"La \nproducción positiva y negativa de calor asociadas a un impulso nervioso\", \nProc. R. Soc. B, 148, 149, 1958, RD y JM Keynes Ritchie, \"La producción \ninicial de calor en las fibras nerviosas mielinizadas de anfibios \", \nProc. Physiol. Soc.., de junio de 1970, página 29p-30p:  \n\"Ahora está claro que en crustáceos y mamíferos ... (Howarth, \net al., 1968) las fibras no mielinizadas \nhay una producción inicial de calor durante (o poco después) el potencial \nde acción, el 80% de los cuales es rápidamente reabsorbido. \") Zotin AI (\" Envejecimiento \ny rejuvenecimiento desde el punto de vista de la termodinámica de los \nprocesos irreversibles \", Priroda, N ° 9, 49-55, 1970), citando \nla teoría de Prigogine-Wiame, sostuvo que el proceso de envejecimiento \nimplica una disminución de la entropía y una disminución en la tasa \nde producción de calor.   La Regeneración implica una producción \nde entropía, como cuando se forma un huevo.  (Las fluctuaciones de temperatura en el \nmomento de la ovulación podrían contribuír a la construcción de \nla entropía en el huevo.) El argumento de que el envejecimiento del \nanimal (como el envejecimiento del cosmos) se rige por \"la tendencia \nal aumento de la entropía\" ha llevado a la gente decir que \nel rejuvenecimiento sería como revolver un huevo.  El argumento \nde Zotin es interesante, porque dice que un huevo es un \"revuelto \nde animales\".  Este punto de vista es muy parecido a la \nteoría del cáncer de Warburg y Szent-Gyorgyi \nen la que se considera a éste como un retorno a un estado de vida más \nsimple.  Para esbozar lo que \nhe sostenido en diversos contextos, \ndigamos que el agua es la parte de la \nsustancia viva de la que podemos discutir \nmás significativamente  en términos de entropía. \nDe hecho, gran parte del concepto de entropía se ha derivado del estudio \ndel agua, dado que cambió el estado \nen las máquinas de vapor, etc. Las células cancerosas, al igual que los óvulos, tienen un mayor contenido \nde agua que las células diferenciadas en funcionamiento \nen un adulto, y ésta agua está menos rígidamente ordenada por \nlas moléculas celulares. Este diferente y más móvil estado del agua, \nse puede medir con la RMN (resonancia magnética nuclear) \n El estrógeno tiene un lugar especial en relación con el agua en el \norganismo, íntimamente involucrado \nen la formación de los óvulos, y donde \néste opera, aumenta tanto la cantidad de agua y, al parecer, un desorden \nde éste agua.  Su función, en mi opinión, es promover \nla regeneración, como en el sistema de Zotin \n, mediante el aumento de la entropía, o \"la \ncodificación del animal\" . La forma en que se potencia la regeneración es mediante el fomento \nde la absorción de agua, estimulando la división celular, y eliminando \nel estado diferenciado de un grado a otro, proporcionando un nuevo suministro \nde \"células madre\", o de \ncélulas al comienzo de una determinada secuencia \nen su diferenciación.  Estas células \ncada vez más numerosas deben encontrar un ambiente hospitalario en \nel que desarrollarse y adaptarse. Y si \nno pueden encontrar este apoyo, entonces las células se reciclarían, \nal igual que las células no alimentadas \nen el cerebro de un feto.  Si nos imaginamos \nel curso del desarrollo como un resumen de la evolución (ontogenia \nrecopilada en la filogénesis\"), \nentonces, el óvulo, que se  \" decodifica \" \nen el desarrollo embrionario, pasa por las etapas de gusano, pez, reptil, \nave, primate, etc, persistiendo en la búsqueda de energía disponible \nque se le permite; en efecto, como diciendo \n \"quiero esto, no quiero que,\" hasta que el óvulo se perfila \ncomo un bebé humano, diciendo \"Yo quiero\", y comienza a \nalimentarse, comienza el aprendizaje, y con \nsuerte sigue el decodificado-autoactualización, por así decirlo.  El envejecimiento degenerativo, en lugar de ser \"físicamente derivado \nde las propiedades del tiempo\", parece ser producido \nsituacionalmente, por diversos tipos de contaminación \nen nuestro suministro de energía.  Las grasas no saturadas, interactúan con un exceso de hierro y \nuna deficiencia de oxígeno o de energía útil, reorientando \nnuestro desarrollo.  La grasas saturadas, en sí mismas, no parecen \ntener \"funciones de señalización\", y cuando, son naturalmente \nmodificadas por nuestros enzimas desaturadoras, las sustancias \nque éstas producen se comportan de forma \nmuy diferente a la derivada de las plantas \"* \neicosanoides\".  *En bioquímica, \n\neicosanoideso icosanoides [1]  [2] es el nombre general que se le da \na un grupo de moléculas de constitución lipídica obtenidas de la oxigenación de los ácidos grasos esenciales de 20 carbonos tipo omega-3 y omega-6 . Cumplen amplias funciones como mediadores \npara el sistema \nnervioso central , \nlos eventos de la inflamación y de la respuesta inmune tanto en vertebrados como en invertebrados . Todos los eicosanoides son \nmoléculas de 20 átomos de carbono y están agrupados en prostaglandinas , tromboxanos , leucotrienos , y ciertos hidroxiácidos precursores de los leucotrienos. Constituyen \nlas moléculas involucradas en las redes de comunicación celular más complejas del organismo animal, \nincluyendo el ser humano. En lo que respecta a \nestos efectos, se ha observado que son de adaptación, en lugar de \ndesadaptativos.  Todos los factores que afectan el cerebro \nde un feto debe examinarse en relación con el envejecimiento del cerebro. Además de los estrógenos y grasas, hago referencia a factores como \n el oxígeno y el dióxido de carbono, glucosa, calcio y hierro, el \ncolesterol, la progesterona, Pregnenolona, DHEA, las endorfinas, GABA, \ntiroides, y de vitamina A. Un elemento adicional, el de \nlas endotoxinas, a la larga tiende a intervenir durante el estrés y \nel envejecimiento, lo que exacerba la tendencia iniciada bajo la influencia \nde los otros factores.  IV. FALSAS \nSEÑALES DEL AMBIENTE  El ambiente puede \nservir de apoyo, aunque también puede \nimpedir el desarrollo de un curso óptimo.  Cogiendo \nde forma pasiva sea lo que sea que es dado, la historia y la naturaleza, \nes entrópica; pero con la elección inteligente de dietas alternativas, \nla selección de otros cursos de acción, se creará y \nreducirá este patrón de entropía.  Si la educación contiene un elemento de elección y \nauto-actualización, entonces los resultados observados en varios estudios \nde la enfermedad de Alzheimer podrían tener un significado más \ninfluyente que el que ha sido sugerido por los investigadores.   Se ha informado un sesgo de diagnóstico \nreferente al resultado de la utilización de las \nBaterías de Test estandarizados basados en \nla evaluación del vocabulario, porque la educación aumenta el vocabulario, \ny tiende a cubrir la pérdida de vocabulario que se produce en la demencia.   En el estudio Framingham, se llegó a la \nconclusión de que había una significativa relación \nentre un menor nivel educativo con la \ndemencia, pero se sugirió que ciertas conductas perjudiciales para \nla salud como el tabaquismo son más comunes entre \npacientes con menor educación.  Un estudio de Seattle sobre los pacientes de un Centro de Salud mostraron \nuna clara diferencia en cuanto al nivel educativo entre \npacientes con demencia y sin demencia, y ambos grupos tenían similares \nprescripciones de Estrógenos.  Las características \nque a mí me parecen importantes, y \nno han sido discutidas por los autores de estos estudios, fueron que \nla mujer con Demencia tiene mucho menor tasa de usoprogestágeno, y una incidencia mucho más elevada de lahisterectomía, que interfiere con la producción de progesterona \nnatural. Aunque Brenner, et al., en el estudio de Seattle llegó a la \nconclusión de que \"este estudio no proporciona pruebas de que \nla terapia de reemplazo hormonal de Estrógenos tiene un efecto sobre \nel riesgo de la enfermedad de Alzheimer en mujeres postmenopáusicas\"; \nBrenner e al., informó de que \"el uso actual de estrógeno por \nvías oral o vaginal, por separado, \ntiene un odd ratio por debajo de 1, mientras que el \nempleo de ambos tipos  ha dado odds ratio por encima de 1 ....\"  (Estas investigaciones parecen \nnegar el hecho que el tipo de Alzheimer en ancianos tiene unha larga \nhistoria de desarrollo, por lo que es, precisamente, \nsu anterior uso el que es pertinente. 31% de las mujeres con demencia \nhabían utilizado estrógeno, y sólo el 20% de el grupo de control. \nDado que el estrógeno es un excitante \ncerebral, su uso actual crea exactamente el mismo tipo de efecto en \nla fluidez verbal y otros signos de la conciencia del medio ambiente \nque la toma de unos mg de cocaína. Cualquier persona que descuida este \nefecto está deliberadamente construyendo un estudio propagandístico)  Esta observación, que \nen el Grupo Demencia había 155% más \nde uso estrogénico que en el grupo normal, así como \nuna diferencia en las tasas de uso de progestágeno (los pacientes \nnormales tenían un 50% más que el uso de progestágeno \nque el grupo de pacientes con demencia) y la histerectomía ( los pacientes \ncon demencia tenían 44,1% frente al \n17% al grupo de pacientes normales, es decir, 259%, como mucho, la incidencia \nde histerectomía -que es un fuerte indicio de un exceso \nen el uso de los estrógenos naturales- después de los 55 años, en \npacientes con demencia es del orden de 374% \nsobre la incidencia en los no dementes) , debería hacer un llamamiento \npara un mayor estudio aclaratorio de estos datos, que tienden a indicar \nque la exposición a estrógenos en la mediana edad aumenta el riesgo \nde la enfermedad de Alzheimer en la vejez, y que incluso \nel uso médico de progestágenos ofrecen cierta protección hacia \nla Demencia...  (Aunque este estudio podría haber sido más \namplio y mejor realizado, es con todo superior a los estudios-basura \npromovidos por la maquinaria publicitaria farmacéutica. He visto o \nescuchado aproximadamente 100 menciones de los \n\"estudios\"  pro -estrógeno \npseudocientíficos, y ninguno citaba \néste.)

SEÑALES, EN RESUMEN.  Cuando \nenseño endocrinología , molesto a mis alumnos de mente ordenada \npor instarlos a considerar el potencial de acción de hormonas \nen todo el cuerpo, y hacerlos pensar en \nlas Capas de control, que van desde el azúcar, la sal, y el dióxido \nde carbono, a través de las \" las hormonas oficiales \", a \nla complejidad de las acciones del sistema nervioso tales como la esperanza, \ny los biorritmos.  Ciertas sustancias que son activas en procesos \nfundamentales, merecen una atención especial como \"señales\", \npero deberían ser entendidas en su contexto. En este sentido, podemos \npensar en Ca2 + como una sustancia-señal, en sus múltiples contextos, \nestando fuertemente regulada por las células de carga energética.  - Magnesio y sodio antagonizan Ca2+ \nen determinadas situaciones.  - \nÁcido linoleico, ácido linolénico, ácido araquidónico: Su toxicidad \npuede ser potencialmente prevenida mediante los ácidos Mead, y sus \nderivados eicosanoides, que se comportan de forma muy distinta \nque las conocidas prostaglandinas, en la medida en que se han comparado, \ny éstos pueden ser reducidos drásticamente \nmediante cambios en la dieta.  - Prostaglandinas, prostaciclina, \ntromboxano:  Su formación está bloqueada por la aspirina y otros antiinflamatorios.  - \nAdenosina: Dormir induce un efecto protector.   La Adenosina es estructuralmente muy similar \na inosina, otra sustancia natural (que se encuentra en la carne, por \nejemplo) que es uno de loss componentes de \"Inosiplex\", un \nfármaco antiviral ( Gordon Brown, la Reserva Federal. Proc. 29, 684, \n1970, y can. J . Microbiol. 18, 1463, 1972) o inmunoestimulante del \ncual se han encontrado efectos contra la senilidad (Doty y Gordon, la \nReserva Federal. Proc. 29).  La Adenosina es \nun buscador de radicales libres y protege contra el calcio y el glutamato \nexcitotóxicos. (I. Yokoi, et al. \"La Adenosina \nrastreó los radicales hidroxilo y previno una epilepsia postraumática,\" \nradical libre Biol.. Med. 19 (4), 473-479, 1995, GP Abbracchio, et al. \" Los receptores Adenosina A (1) en los sinaptosomas del \ncerebro de rata: Mecanismos trasductores, \n(2) Efectos sobre la liberación de glutamato, y la conservación después \nde la inhibición del metabolismo,\" Desarrollo de Drogas. Res. \n35 (3), 119-129, 1995.) Asimismo, parece proteger contra la relativa \nhiperventilación que los residuos de dióxido de carbono, y las endotoxinas \nque puedan interferir con su acción protectora.  - \nLa Guanosina, en este mismo grupo de sustancias, podría tener algunas \npropiedades similares.  -  Timidina y citidina, \nbasadas en la pirimidina, son análogos endógenos de los barbitúricos, \ny como ellos, pueden ser los reguladores de las enzimas del citocromo \nP450.  - Uridina, en este grupo, promueve \nla síntesis de glucógeno y se libera de bacterias en presencia de \nla penicilina.  - \nHierro: Regulador de la estabilidad del mRNA, síntesis \nsanguínea; reacciona con agentes reductores y aceites no saturados, \npara producir radicales libres y peróxidos lípidos, y su absorción \nes incrementada por los estrógenos, hipotiroidismo, anemia o falta \nde oxígeno.  - \nGlutamato y aspartato, excitotoxinas, y GABA, un \ntransmisor inhibitorio.  Estos tienen vínculos metabólicos entre \nsí, con el amoníaco, y con el estrés y el metabolismo energético.  -  El estrógeno y la acetilcolina, \nexcitotoxinas; ver Savolainen, et al., 1994.  La información es abrumadoramente \nclara, y la publicidad que manifiesta todo lo contrario es un horrible \nejemplo de la corrupción de los medios de comunicación por la industria \nfarmacéutica - \nEndorfinas: estrés inducido, especificidad lateral, involucrados en \nla acción de estrógenos, son antagonizados \npor naloxona y similares inhibidores de opiáceos.  He propuesto que las \nendorfinas pueden causar o mantener algunos de los síntomas del envejecimiento.  LaNaloxona parece ser un tratamiento útil para la senilidad.  Ann.  E. Roberts,.  NY Acad.  Sci...  396, 165, 1982; B. Reisberg, et al., N. Engl.  396, \n165, 1982; N. Engl.  J. Med.  308, 721, 1983.  - Endotoxinas: \nAcción antimitocondrial, las causas de elevación de los estrógenos.  Tienen \nsinergia con grasas no saturadas, y \nla naloxona opone algunos de sus efectos tóxicos.  - \nUrea, colesterol: La estabilidad estructural de \nlas proteínas y complejos de lípido-proteínas.  - Sustancias que actúan directamente \nsobre la estructura del agua: Creo que todos los reguladores \nnaturales tienen un efecto sobre la estructura del agua, pero algunos \nsustancias inusuales actúan principalmente en el agua.  Los \nGases nobles, por ejemplo, no tienen efectos químicos, \nen cambio tienden a formar \"jaulas\" de moléculas de agua \na su alrededor.  - Alcanfor, adamantane, y el \nfármaco antiviral amantadina, probablemente tengan el mismo efecto \nestructurante del agua, y la amantadina, se utiliza ampliamente como \nuna terapia en la enfermedad de Parkinson, \ny tiene una acción anti-excitotóxica.

V. \nDESEQUILIBRIO HORMONAL, LO QUE LLEVA A LA INHIBICIÓN, FALLOS DE PROTECCIÓN \nY ENFERMEDAD DE ALZHEIMER  \"Toda \n muerte celular se caracteriza por un aumento del calcio intracelular \n....\"\" Aumento del calcio citoplásmico libre puede ser llamado \n'el último camino en común » de la enfermedad de \nlas células y de la muerte celular. El envejecimiento como fondo de \nlas enfermedades también se caracteriza por un aumento del calcio intracelular. \nenfermedades típicamente asociadas con la edad son la hipertensión, \nla arteriosclerosis, la diabetes mellitus y la demencia \".              a. \nLA FUNCIÓN DE LA ENERGÍA  La mayoría de las personas \nsufrimos Demencia ligera de vez en cuando; cuando \nestamos muy soñolientos o cansados, \nenfermos o borrachos, o tenemos un desequilibrio hormonal o \nun estado de ansiedad extrema  A veces, los médicos han descrito \na las personas como Dementes, lo que implica que \nesta condición quizás nunca mejoraría, cuando la persona padece depresión \no sufre hipotiroidismo.  Si la persona tiene una historia de la epilepsia, o es anciana, el médico \ntiene más probabilidades de diagnosticar demencia que si la misma pérdida \nde la función mental se produce en una persona joven sin antecedentes \nde un trastorno nervioso.  Incluso las personas con un menor nivel Educativo \ntienen mayor riesgo de ser diagnosticadas como \"Dementes\".  En 1976, vi a una señora \nde 52 años de edad que tenía el diagnóstico de demencia epiléptica. \nDespués de 3 o 4 días tomando progesterona, \nrestableció su funcionamiento mental en la medida en que \npodía manejarse con normalidad en su ciudad, volvió a trabajar...  Unos \nmeses más tarde, regresó a la escuela de postgrado, \ncontinuó y obtuvo su título universitario...  Años más tarde, un hombre \nde unos 80 mostró los signos estándar de la Demencia Senil, \ncomo infantilismo, confusión, egocentrismo, y la inestabilidad \nemocional.  A los pocos días después de \ntomar una mezcla de tiroides, Pregnenolona y progesterona, \nsu mente se volvió clara, y fue capaz de trabajar en un proyecto de \ninvestigación que había planeado años antes.  Cuando la temperatura \ndel cuerpo está muy por debajo de lo normal, el funcionamiento mental \nse ve seriamente limitado.  Con todo, \ncreo que la primera cuestión que debemos preguntarnos \n sobre una persona que padece Demencia es: \n                     \n¿ tiene el síndrome del Cerebro frío, o hay algo más involucrado \nen su dolencia?  Cuando podemos afirmar \nque un cerebro ha encogido drásticamente,  se llena \nde placas y desarolla gliosis, sabemos que algo más que un \"síndrome \nde cerebro frío\" está involucrado, pero no sabemos \ncuánto, a nivel cuantitativo y cualitativo, \n puede ser recuperado a nivel de función mental si las hormonas son \nnormalizadas.  Cada momento de mal funcionamiento, \nprobablemente deja señales-déficits estructurales.   Tarde o temprano, es \nadecuado prevenir los errores funcionales que \nderivan en  un mayor daño, y a su vez dar la oportunidad de funcionar \na los Mecanismos de Regeneración.  Antes de la \"Muerte \npor calcio\" descrita (anteriormente citado) por Fujita, hay muchas \noportunidades de intervenir para detener o revertir el proceso.  Para \nconsiderar lo viejo que una persona es, se debería hacer \nmayor hincapié en la inhibición de \nla protección, en lugar de aumentar inmediatamente la producción de \nenergía.  Magnesio, dióxido de \ncarbono, el sueño, la luz roja, y la naloxona podría ser apropiado \nal comienzo de la terapia.  El estado de reposo de una célula es un \nestado altamente energético.  Para los antiguos *Paulovianos, el estado de reposo \nexiste entre dos niveles de energía, y aplican el término \"inhibición \nprotectora\" generalmente para referirse a la \nDepleción de estado (parabiosis) que ocurre en estados de Coma o en \nAgotamiento, pero estoy usando la expresión en un sentido más general, \ny parece razonable ahora que el concepto de \"Daños Excitotoxicos\" \nse ha convertido en un tema de actualidad. \nMe refiero a esto a fin de incluir todo lo que protege contra el daño \nExcitotoxico. Esta definición, por lo tanto, tiene la virtud de ser \nbioquímicamente y fisiológicamente muy específica, conservando al \nmismo tiempo la significación funcional y la importancia terapéutica \nque le daban los Paulovianos.  (En mi libro,La mente y el tejido,y el capítulo \"Un principio unificador\" \nen Energía generativa, discuto sobrela idea del estado de reposo \ny de protección de inhibición).  El \nsueño saludable es un ejemplo de restauración, \nde inhibición protectora. La carga energética, incluidos los niveles \nde ATP, la creatina fosfato, y almacenamiento de glucógeno, regulan \nmuchos sistemas de reparación enzimática.  He sugerido (1975, J. Orthomol. Psiquiatría) la manera en que la sensibilidad \nde la entropía o la inhibición en reposo de una enzima podría participar \nen el cambio cerebral hacia un estado de inhibición.    Una \npublicación reciente(JH Benington and HC Heller, \"Restoration \nof brain energy metabolism as the function of sleep\", Progress \nin Neurobiol. 45, 347-360, 1995) ha propuesto que la reducción de \nla carga de energía y despolarización de las células actúan a través \nde la secreción de adenosina para restaurar glucógeno. El almacenamiento de glucógeno disminuye con el envejecimiento, este \ntrabajo apoya la idea de que la inhibición protectora se debiilita \ncon la edad.(LN Simanovskiy and Zh. A. Chotoyev, \"The effect \nof hypoxia on glycogenolysis and glycolysis rates in the rat brain,\" \nZhurnal Evolyutsionnoy Biokhimii i Fiziologii 6(5), 577-579, 1970.)  \"... las condiciones que \nse han demostrado que estimulan la liberación de adenosina \ndesde el tejido nervioso representan \ncualquier aumento de la demanda metabólica (... activación de los \nreceptores excitatorios), o disminución en dicho suministro \n(hipoxia, isquemia, hipoglucemia )....\"  H Benington and HC Heller, \"Restoration \nof brain energy metabolism as the function of sleep,\", \" Prog.  in \nNeurobiology 45, 347-360, 1995. \"En el \ncerebro, la estimulación de  adenosina aumenta \nla conductancia del potasio que produce hiperpolarización, reduciendo \nasí la respuesta neuronal ....\" \"La liberación de Adenosina \nse activa globalmente como respuesta a los cambios en la homeostasis \nde la energía cerebral.\"  \"Una serie de hallazgos \nproporcionan apoyo indirecto a la hipótesis de que el glucógeno se \nva agotando y se restaura durante el despertar durante el sueño.\"  \"La reducción de la disponibilidad \nde glucógeno hacia los astrocitos debe aumentar ... \nla liberación de la adenosina....\"    \"Debido \na que la concentración de ATP es 100 veces superior a la concentración \nde AMP, disminuye durante 1 minuto la carga de energía celular esto \nse traduce en un gran aumento proporcional de \nla concentración de adenosina extracelular...\" Los términos \"latencia funcional\" \n\ny \"latencia G0 son similares en el sentido de un estado de reposo; \ncuando las células están en el estado de \"inactividad G0\", \nen latencia celular, están a la espera de su \nempleo regenerativo, pero no comparto la \nidea que no pueden ser reconstituidas a partir de su funcionamiento, \ncomo células diferenciadas.  En las plantas,*la Desdiferenciación \n se activa con bastante facilidad, y en el estudio de las células animales \nla tendencia en esa dirección parece muy evidente, aunque mucha gente \nsigue diciendo que esto no es posible. * (Biol. - vuelta de las células a una condición general o primitiva) . En general, procesos tales como la peroxidación lipídica o \nel influjo de calcio, causan la replicación de las células en un nivel, \ny provocan la muerte celular en un nivel superior.   La energía para resistir el estrés hace \nposible la inactividad, y evita el deterioro de las células, del tipo \nque se produce en el envejecimiento.  O. \nToussaint, et al., \"Cellular aging and energetic factors\", \nExp..  Gerontology \n30(1), 1-22, 1995.  \"Los experimentos realizados \ncon células endoteliales en el contexto de la \nla toxicidad de los radicales libres en una Isquemia-*Reperfusión, \ntambién ofrece buenos ejemplos de los efectos de la energía celular \nen las resistencia celulular a estas moléculas tóxicas.\" *( \"... si se dota de un suplemento \nde energía ... el efecto tóxico de los radicales libres es mucho menor \n....\"  . Los enfoques específicos de \nesta orientación - para dinamizar el cerebro \nen estado de reposo - son diametralmente opuestas a algunas de las \"terapias\" \npara la enfermedad de Alzheimer que se han promovido recientemente por \nla industria farmacéutica: fármacos que \npotencian la estimulación, sobre todo para aumentar la excitación \ncolinérgica; incluso aminoácidos excitotóxicos \ny sus análogos, y los estrógenos, que \nson pluriexcitantes cerebrales , proconvulsivos, promotores excitotóxicos, \ny agentes antimemoria.  Estas publicaciones Product-centered \nse destacan claramente de las investigaciones actuales  Hay muchos \ncírculos viciosos relacionados con la energía asociados \nal envejecimiento, pero el principal parece ser \nel bucle calcio-radicales libres- estrógenos-tiroides-grasa,en \nlos que la capacidad de producir la estabilización de sustancias, incluidos \nel dióxido de carbono y la progesterona se pierden progresivamente, \naumentando la susceptibilidad a la inestabilidad de grasas no saturadas.  b. La producción de estrógeno \nse ve promocionada cuando el tejido es más \nfrío, y cuando éste disminuye la temperatura corporal.  Además, los estrógenos y \nlas endorfinas actúan conjuntamente en muchos aspectos (incluido el \ncomportamiento del*estro) y la naloxona (antagonista \nde la morfina y las endorfinas), aumenta la temperatura corporal y se \nopone al estrógeno. *Conducta de celo animal La \nNaloxona se ha demostrado que mejora los síntomas de las personas con \ndemencia, y yo he visto rápida y potentemente, mejorar la claridad \nmental de una mujer de 60 años que había utilizado estrógenos. Es, \njunto a la Clonidina (un fármaco anti-adrenalina), un buen candidato \npara los golpes de calor y otros síntomas de la menopausia.  En diversas condiciones \ndegenerativas del cerebro, la coagulación de la sangre ha estado implicada \ncomo una causa directa o una complicación de dicha degeneración.  Many people are promoting unsaturated \noils for their \"anti-clotting\" value, in spite of the older \nliterature showing that they inhibit proteolytic enzymes and slow clot \nremoval.  Muchas personas \nestán promocionando los aceites no \nsaturados por su valor \"anti-coagulante\", a pesar de que la \nliteratura clásica muestra de que éstos inhiben las enzimas proteolíticas \ny la promueven una lenta eliminación del coágulo.  Varias publicaciones \nmás recientes han puesto de manifiesto otros aspectos de su participación \nen la formación de trombos.  AJ Honour, et al., \"The effects of changes in \ndiet on lipid levels and platelet thrombus formation in living blood \nvessels,\" Br.  Honor AJ, et al., Pathol.  59(4), 390-394, 1978--corn oil caused platelets \nto be more sensitive to ADP.  59 (4) Aunque hay mucho \nque hablar sobre  \"la fluidez de \nla membrana,\" como una cosa deseable, y la pérdida de lípidos \nno saturados en un cerebro envejecido, hay algunas observaciones \ninteresantes relacionadas con la \"viscosidad\" en la enfermedad \nde Alzheimer.  Lasplaquetas de pacientes con Alzheimer \nson menos viscosas, y los lípidos \nextraídos del cerebro son más fluidos, y contienen un 30% menos colesterol \nde lo normal  (a nivel molar, en relación con los fosfolípidos). (Roth \nSG, et al., 1995.) En general, la peroxidación lipídica causa \nla viscosidad celular para aumentar, al parecer, el entrecruzamiento \nde las proteínas, pero creo que la \nsignificación de la disminución del colesterol se refiere a su importancia \ncomo precursor de Pregnenolona y progesterona, y la conocida asociación \ncon la enfermedad de Alzheimer de una variante de la proteína de transporte \nde colesterol, apoE, que supongo es un poco menos estable que la forma \nmolecular, más susceptibles al mal funcionamiento en \nsituación de estrés.  La matriz extracelular \nes un importante factor en la función y la estabilidad de las células \ncerebrales.  (LF Agnati, et al., \"The concept \nof trophic units in the central nervous system,\" Prog. in Neurobiol. \n46, 561-574, 1995. Any factor producing edema tends to disrupt the extracellular \nmatrix (Chan and Fishman, 1978, 1980, and L. Loeb, 1948.)  Se sabe que los Accesos nerviosos son promovidos por los estrógenos, \npor grasas no saturadas, y por la peroxidación lipídica, y \ntodo ello provoca  un aumento en el tamaño del depósito de ácidos \ngrasos libres en el cerebro. Convulsiones prolongadas causan daño a los nervios en determinadas \nzonas, especialmente en el hipocampo, tálamo y neocorteza (Siesjo, \net al., 1989).  De la Demencia se sabe que \nes producida por convulsiones prolongadas.  La exposición prenatal a los estrógenos, por falta de oxígeno, o \nde grasas no saturadas reduce el tamaño del cerebroal nacer.  (JM \nBourre, N. Gozlan-Devillierre, O. Morand, and N. Baumann, \"Importance \nof exogenous saturated fatty acids during brain development and myelination \nin mice,\" Ann. Biol. Anim., Biochim., Biophys. 19(1B), 172-180, \n1979.  Hay aparentemente una exigencia \nde las grasas saturadas durante el desarrollo . Bajo la influencia de los estrógenos, o \nde grasas no saturadas, las células del cerebro se inflaman, y su forma \ne interacciones son alterados.La memoria se deteriora dado \nun exceso de estrógenos.  Los estrógenos, \nla grasas no saturadas y el exceso de hierro matan a las células por \nla peroxidación lipídica, y este proceso es promovido por la falta \nde oxígeno.  El feto y los ancianos tienen altos niveles de hierro en las células.  El \nestrógeno aumenta la absorción de hierro.  La Terapia Estrogénica produce un aumento \nde los ácidos grasos libres en la sangre, y la peroxidación lipídica \nen los tejidos.  Todo este proceso tiende a acelerar la \nacumulación de Lipofuscina, pigmento del envejecimiento.  El Ácido láctico, cuya \nproducción es promovida por los estrógenos, reduce la disponibilidad \nde dióxido de carbono, lo que lleva a deficiencia de suministro de \nsangre al cerebro.  Elestrógeno estimula la división \ncelular, pero también puede aumentar la tasa de muerte celular. \nLos Ácidos grasos insaturados, así mismo también pueden estimular \no matar.   Ambos, \npromueven a su vez, la formación del pigmento \ndel envejecimiento. Además de aumentar la concentración de ácidos \ngrasos libres, el estrógeno posiblemente \ndisminuye el nivel de colesterol, cambios observados en el cerebro senil.   El estrógeno causa alteraciones masivas \nen la matriz extracelular, y parece promover la disolución de los microtúbulos \n(Nemetschek-Gannsler), como hace el Calcio. Las grasas no saturadas aumentan la absorción de calcio por lo menos \nen algunas células del cerebro (Katsuki H. y S. Okuda, 1995). Las grasas \nno saturadas , como los estrógenos, aumentan la permeabilidad de los \nvasos sanguíneos.  Las grasas insaturadas \ncausan edema cerebral, inhiben la captación de colina, bloqueando la \nproducción de acetilcolina.  Laprogesterona \nes un factor de crecimiento nervioso, producido por las células gliales \n(oligodendrocitos). Promueve la producción de mielina, protege contra \nataques, y protege las células contra los radicales libres.  Protege antes de la concepción, \ndurante la gestación, durante el crecimiento y la pubertad, y durante \nel envejecimiento. Promueve la regeneración.  Su producción está \nbloqueada por el estrés, la peroxidación lipídica, un exceso de estrógenos \ny el hierro.  La aspirina protege contra la toxicidad de hierro, la formación del \ncoágulo, y reduce la peroxidación lipídica, mientras que \nbloquea la formación de prostaglandinas.  La aspirina y otros antiinflamatorios, \ntomadas para la artritis, han sido claramente asociadas con una menor \nincidencia de Alzheimer, reduciendo la formación de prostaglandinas \na partir del ácido araquidónico.  Los \nÁcidos grasos no saturados, no los \nácidos grasos saturados, son las señales que activan los sistemas \nde la célula.  Diferentes estímulos pueden inducir la \nactividad celular, muerte celular, o \nmodificar a otro tipo de células.  (J. Niquet, et al., \"Glial \nreaction after seizure induced hippocampal lesion: Immunohistochemical \ncharacterization of proliferating glial cells) J. Neurocytol. 23(10), 641-656, \n1994 De este modo, \nuna \"deficiencia\" de losácidos grasos poliinsaturados \nconduce a la alteración de las tasas de regeneración celular y la \ndiferenciación, un cerebro más grande en el \nnacimiento, la mejora de la función del sistemainmunitario, \ndisminución de la inflamación, la disminución de la \nmortalidad por endotoxinas, menor susceptibilidad a la peroxidación \nlipídica, aumento de la tasa metabólica basal y la respiración, aumento \nde la función tiroidea, pubertad tardía \ny disminución de otros signos de estrógeno dominante.  Cuando en la dieta \nlos AGPI no están disponibles, el organismo produce una pequeña cantidad \nde ácidos grasos no saturados (ácidos Mead), pero éstos no \nactivan los sistemas celulares de la misma manera \nque las plantas derivadas de AGPI, que \nson los precursores de un grupo totalmente diferente de prostaglandinas.  c. \nVITAMINA A Y ESTEROIDES Enla variedad de tipos \ncelulares, la vitamina A funciona como un antagonista de los estrógenos, \ninhibiendo la división celular y promocionando \no  manteniendo el Estado de Funcionamiento.  Promueve la síntesis de proteínas, regula \nlos lisosomas, y protege contra la peroxidación lipídica.  Así como el estrés \ny la toxicidad de estrógenos se asemejan al \nproceso de envejecimiento, lo hace una deficiencia de vitamina A.   Mientras que sus funciones conocidas son \nmuy variadas, creo que el mayor uso de la vitamina A es para la producción \nde Pregnenolona, progesterona, y otros esteroides asociados a la juventud. \nUna de las más importantes funciones de la \nvitamina E es la de preteger la oxidación destructiva de la vitamina \nA  Aunque \nse ha prestado escasa atención a los efectos de las grasas no saturadas \nen vitamina A, la destrucción de la vitamina E \nconlleva necesariamente la destrucción de la vitamina A. El aumento \nde la peroxidación lipídica en la tercera edad representa un círculo \nvicioso, en el que la pérdida de los antioxidantes y vitamina A conduce \na una mayor degeneración orgánica.  Para producir Pregnenolona, \ntiroides, vitamina A, y colesterol tienen que ser enviadas \na la mitocondria en la proporción y cantidad suficiente.  Normalmente, el \nestrés es equilibrado por el aumento de la síntesis de Pregnenolona, \nlo que mejora la capacidad de hacer frente al estrés. La Peroxidación \nLipídica, como resultado de la acumulación de ácidos grasos insaturados, \nhierro, y la deficiencia de energía, \ndaña a la mitocondria en la capacidad de producir Pregnenolona.  Cuando \nla Pregnenolona es insuficiente, se activa un \nexceso de cortisol. Cuando la progesterona \nes deficiente, el efecto de los estrógenos \nno encuentra oposición alguna.  Cuando tiroides y progesterona son deficientes, \nincluso las células grasas sintetizan estrógenos.  d. \nNATURALEZA DE LA ENFERMEDAD DE ALZHEIMER  Aunque \ndentro del Alzheimer, hasta hace poco que se hace referencia a un determinado \ntipo de demencia orgánica que ocurre en las personas a los \ntreinta, cuarenta y cincuenta (demencia presenil), han \nsido vistas similitudes estructurales \ncon la demencia senil que han causado \nque el actual término vaya perdiendo \nsu significado original.  La \narterosclerosis que aparece en el Alzheimer, e incluso la muerte de \ncélulas nerviosas, a veces se descuida \nen favor de ideas más elegantes, haciendo hincapié en ciertas proteínas \nque causan obturaciones y placas.  Hasta hace poco, \nlas obturaciones  se han interpretado comúnmente como desechos tras \nla muerte celular, más que como uno de los procesos que causan la muerte \nde la célula.  La Demencia tipo Alzheimer es \ndiferente de otras demencias, pero se superpone con ellas, y con la \nedad y el estrés relacionados se producen cambios en otros órganos.  Los signos físicos (observados \nen la autopsia) de Alzheimer:  1) La muerte de las neuronas \n(aumento de células gliales)  2) Placas de amiloide (extracelular), \nasociados a una variante de la apolipoproteína E, el alelo épsilon \n4  3) Obturaciones de las fibras \n(a nivel intracelular, o restos después de que \nla célula ha desaparecido),  4) Amiloide en los vasos sanguíneos.  Observaciones Funcionales y \nbioquímicas:  1) El problema de la energía \nmitocondrial, Oxidasa citocromo y su \nregulación, la temperatura corporal /perturbación en la tasa del pulso; \nla peroxidación lipídica; Defectos respiratorio; alteración de \nla absorción de los aminoácidos; la memoria; dominio de los sistemas \nexcitatorios frente a la adenosina \ninhibitoria / GABA / progesterona.  / Sistema Pregnenolona. - Aumento \nen la absorción de calcio, que está asociado con la peroxidación \nlipídica y la muerte celular.  - Aumento de cortisol y DHEA.  2) Depósito de proteínas anormales, \ntales como-amiloide transtiretina; albúmina vinculante de AGPI, frente \nal transporte de tiroides y retinol.  - Aumento de \nBeta-glucuronidasa, depósito de estrógeno en las células.   )  .  3)Proteínas anormalmente \nfosforiladas (tau); asociación con la variante de Apo E; \nmicrotúbulos tau organizan las proteínas, los microtúbulos están \ninvolucrados en el transporte de colesterol; fosforilación por la quinasa, \nregulados a su vez por las AGPI; los filamentos intermedios \nestán por lo general asociados al estrés.  4) ApoE, \nen el citoplasma, que participa en la entrega \nde colesterol en la síntesis de Pregnenolona, como en \nlas suprarrenales; su expresión regulada por la tiroides. Reglamento \nde la cadena lateral enzimática, la regulación de la ingesta de colesterol \ny la conversión a Pregnenolona por el receptor de endozepine / \nReceptores GABA, modificada por la progesterona.  e. \nUN EJEMPLO DE UN PROBLEMA REGULATORIO El aceite vegetal suprime la \ntiroides aumentando la producción de estrógenos.  Los \nestrógenos y el calcio despolimerizan los microtúbulos. \nLos microtúbulos transportan para la Apo E transtiretina, entonces \nla síntesis de Pregnenolona de la tiroides y \ncolesterol se interrumpe.  Si la \nTranstiretina y Apo E no se utilizan \nson acumulados, y se depositan en los vasos sanguíneos, alrededor de \nlos nervios, y en el citoplasma.  La deficiencia de \nPregnenolona y Progesterona (agravados por \nla deficiencia de la tiroides) causa la pérdida de la memoria, desestabilización \nde las células nerviosas, falta de formación de la mielina, y exceso \nen la síntesis de cortisol.  Los radicales libres y el Calcio causan \nlesiones múltiples en las células nerviosas, incluyendo la muerte \nde los nervios.El estrógeno es liberado por \nun nivel elevado de beta-glucuronidasa.  Losdesequilibrios de otros esteroides, incluyendo el cortisol \ny la DHEA, se desarrollan como células para compensar la deficiencia \nde Pregnenolona, causando cambios en el equilibrio de las células gliales.  Hipotiroidismo, el exceso \nde estrógeno, grasas no saturadas causan un aumento en la permeabilidad \nvascular y edema cerebral, fuga de proteínas, y la alteración de la \nmatriz .  VI: ESTRUCTURA COMO SISTEMA DE REGULACIÓN: \nUNA VISION DE NUEVAS EPIGÉNESIS  En la introducción he mencionado \nque la regulación membranosa y la Determinación genética deben ser \nconsideradas como teoríasya extintas . Lo que he estado diciendo acerca de los \nsistemas de auto-actualización y los factores que \nlos perturban se deriva de una visión de la función de la célula \nque se ha venido desarrollando desde la década de 1920.  Alrededor de 1940, un bioquímico ruso (Oparin, creo) propone que las \nenzimas de la glicólisis estaban vinculados a la estructura de la célula \ncuando no estaban en uso, y que eran \"desorbidas\" \nbajo condiciones que requieran de abundante glicolisis.  Tras conocer este concepto, \nen 1970 propuse que las células de agua llevan a cabo una transición \nbajo tales condiciones (que podrían incluir el aumento de la temperatura, \nreducción de oxígeno,  estimulación hormonal o nerviosa).  La activación de la \nglicólisis se explica generalmente por la \ndisponibilidad de sustancias regulatorias \ncomo el amoniaco, fosfato, y NAD, y muchos bioquímicos \nse satisfacen de entender las de células en términos de modelos de \ntubo de ensayo.  Pero en los últimos \naños, ha quedado claro que algunas de estas moléculas básicas de \nregulación dirigen los componentes estructurales de la célula.  (T. Henics, \"Thoughts over \ncell biology: A commentary,\" Physiol. Chem. Phys. & Med. NMR \n27, 139-140, 1995.) Aunque los detalles no \nestán claros, se sabe que las hormonas y otros factores estabilizan \no desestabilizan el ARN, y que durante algunos de estos eventos se unen \na las enzimas de la ARN. Cuando estos \nfactores se combinan con la información que se acumule en el empalme \ny la modificación de ARN, la copia de \nARN se convierte en ADN, entonces, \nel sistema hereditario se considera mucho más flexible \nde lo que se creía que era.  Un cambio \nen el estado global es capaz de dirigir cada una de las partes del proceso, \ncontinuamente. De esta manera, la célula se asemeja \nmás a un sistema de control analógico, \nmás que digital: cada parte está momentáneamente guiado, en lugar \nde esperar por una \"retroalimentación\".  Cuando antes, \nlos \"mecanismos de regulación celulares\" se \nreferían a determinados mecanismos de retroalimentación sobre la base \nde las interacciones de la difusión de moléculas al azar, la nueva \ncomprensión de la célula se asemeja a un sistema muy estructurado \nen el que muy poco es al azar, y las posibilidades de adaptación de \nla célula, en vez de limitarse a una serie de \nmarcadores genéticos, se moldea por todas las influencias ambientales \nimaginables . La estructura de la célula, \nlejos de ser \"una lectura del genoma\", es sensiblemente modificado \nconstantemente por los procesos que \nincorporan algunos de estos factores ambientales en el \nestablecimiento de cada nueva estabilidad.  El viejo modelo-genetista \nse ha visto obligado a admitir que los genes no pueden especificar todo \nlo que está en la estructura del organismo, y \nla complejidad del cerebro fue la que obligó a este reconocimiento \nde que ciertas cosas se desarrollan \"epigeneticamente.\" Pero \neste nuevo hecho que la mayoría de los biólogos se muestran renuentes \na aceptar es que la estructura de la célula en sí está muy desarrollado \nen gran medida debido a la información recibida desde el medio ambiente, \nes decir, \"epigeneticalmente\".  La epigenética(del griego epi, en o sobre) se refiere \na los cambios reversibles de ADN que hace que unos genes se expresen o no dependiendo de condiciones \nexteriores (polifenismo). El término fue acuñado por C. H. Waddington  Tradicionalmente, \nla significación del concepto epigénesis \nse refería a que la forma de un embrión o \ndel organismo no preexiste, o no está completamente especificada por \nlos genes.Es decir, que ha tenido que ver con las relaciones \nentre las células.Se trataba del \nreconocimiento que \"las células son lo suficientemente hábiles \ncomo para diseñar un organismo.\" Es un paso significativo más allá de que para el reconocimiento de \nque \"las células son lo suficientemente hábiles como para \nrediseñarse y sintonizarse en situaciones \nnovedosas  Los \nBiólogos que trabajan con bacterias y levaduras han visto a éstas \nadaptarse de forma no aleatoria en condiciones nuevas . \"Las  \nmutaciones dirigidas \" son imposibles, de acuerdo con el \"dogma \ncentral\", que cuenta con el apoyo de los libros de texto y la mayoría \nde los profesores de biología, pero éstas se producen en los \norganismos unicelulares.  Barbara McClintock \nmostró que en el maíz los genes móviles se movilizaron \ndebido el estrés. Aunque esta no es exactamente \nuna \" mutación dirigida \", es un ejemplo de un mecanismo \npara aumentar la adaptación cuando ésta es \nnecesaria.  Hay un determinado tipo \nde enzima que hace cortes específicos \nen la cadena de ADN.  Y aunque los \nBiotecnólogos lo encontraron conveniente para sus fines, su \nexistencia se fundamenta en efectos fisiológicos, probablemente en \ntodos los organismos, como las descritas por McClintock en el maíz.  En el \nfase final del estrés que produce \nun tipo especial de muerte celular denominado apoptosis, estas enzimas \nhacen por así decirlo, un confeti del genoma.  Venenos, como los estrógenos, ácidos grasos \ninsaturados, o incluso la radiación, producen efectos diferentes en \ndiferentes dosis.  Las dosis bajas suelen \nestimular la división celular, dosis mayores producen cambios de tipo \ncelular y estados alterados de la diferenciación y, por último, ciertas \ndosis producen la denominada muerte celular \npor apoptosis.  Hay una ideología en \ntorno a la apoptosis, que sostiene que es \"genéticamente programada\", \nesto implica que cada vez que la apoptosis se produce en el cerebro, \nella estaba destinada a suceder tarde o temprano. Pero en realidad, \nhay varios tipos de \"factores de crecimiento\" que pueden prevenirla.  Cada vez está más claro \nque representa un estrés excesivo y/o una \ndeficiencia de recursos.  La participación de la genética en la \ndiferenciación y la adaptación radical \nadaptación sugiere que (Epigenéticamente) los recursos de las células \nson ilimitadas.  Los cambios que se sabe \nque producen los venenos a los que habitualmente estamos expuestos son \nexactamente los cambios que se producen durante el \nenvejecimiento cerebral. Como he revisado cientos de estudios que definen \nlos efectos del estrógeno, grasas no saturadas, el exceso de hierro, \ny la peroxidación lípida, mi argumento parece común, incluso trivial, \nsalvo que sé que claramente se refiere a los tratamientos para la mayoría \nde las enfermedades degenerativas, y que la \ngran maquinaria de la industria publicitaria propaga \nuna perspectiva diferente en varios puntos que son esenciales \nen mi argumentación.  Esta industria publicitaria \npresentan un mito acerca de la naturaleza \nhumana, por lo que yo expongo una contrateoría. En aquellos tiempos \nlos humanos con mayor crecimiento cerebral vivían en \nlos trópicos.  Sugiero que en \nestos orígenes antes del desarrollo de la agricultura a base de grano, \nestos antepasados comieron una dieta que es relativamente libre de grasas \nno saturadas y baja en hierro - sobre la base de frutas tropicales.  Sugiero que el cráneo \nde Boskop en elMonte Kilimanjaro fue un protototipo  representativo \nde las personas que vivían bajo esas condiciones, y que sólo debido \nal conocimiento actual de la relación del tamaño cerebral \ncon la longevidad, éstos - como diversos mitos de la \"Edad de \nOro\" sugieren - deben haber tenido una larga tasa de vida.  A medida que los humanos \nmigraron hacia el norte y desarrollaron nuevas formas de vida, su consumo \nde grasas no saturadas aumentó, su cerebro se redujo \nde tamaño, envejeciendo más rápido Fósiles Neanderthales \nmuestran que la linaza es un alimento básico de su dieta.  Incluso \nviviendo en los trópicos, hay muchas posibilidades de dietas ricas \nen sustancias que alteran las señales, incluyendo el hierro, y en latitudes \naltas existen oportunidades para reducir nuestra exposición a ellas.  Como fuente de proteínas, \nla leche es especialmente baja en su contenido de hierro. Las patatas, \ndebido a la alta calidad de sus proteínas, \nestán probablemente libre de sustancias con señales tóxicas. Muchas frutas tropicales, \nademás de tener relativamente grasas saturadas, también son bajas \nen hierro, y, a menudo, contienen importantes cantidades de aminoácidos \ny proteínas. En este contexto, me viene a la mente la longeva \nJeanne Calment, consumidora diaria de chocolate: \nCuando ella se acercaba a su 121 cumpleaños, \ntodavía comía chocolate, aunque hbía dejado de fumar y beber vino. \nSe ha encontrado que las grasas saturadas del chocolate \n bloquean la toxicidad de los aceites ricos en ácido linoleico, y sus \nextrañas proteínas parecen tener una acción anabolizante.  Si realmente nos tomamos en serio la Epigénesis tradicional, y sobre \ntodo si aceptamos una concepción más profunda de \nla Epigénesis a nivel de la estructura y la función celular, tenemos \nque ver el organismo como una especie de \"torbellino de células\", \ncompuesta por torbellinos de los átomos (tal como la describe Vernadsky), \nen la que nuestro estilo de vida fijalos límites dentro de \nlos que nuestras células se autoreestructuran.  El azar \nen la producción de radicales libres, en lugar de actuar sólo en forma \nde daño genético o proteínas cross-linking, también es capaz de \nactuar como un proceso de señalización, es decir, en un nivel estrictamente \nfisiológico.  Unexceso de ácidos \ngrasos insaturados constituye en sí misma una gran distorsión de los \nsistemas reguladores, pero también da lugar a distorsiones en el \"sistema \nde eicosanoides\", un incremento en la producción descontrolada \nde radicales libres, y cambios a nivel energético, la actividad tiroidea \ny el equilibrio en los esteroides. El envejecimiento cuerpo, en lugar \nde ser como un coche que necesita más y más hasta que se \navería por el uso, es más parecido a un coche que viaja por una carretera \nque se vuelve cada vez más complicada y fangoso, hasta \nconvertirse en un pantano intransitable.  El tratamiento \nque sugiero es una corrección del proceso de señalización, en lugar \nde \"cirugía genética\", trasplante, etc, que es la implicación \npesimista de la doctrina de que el daño oxidativo es simplemente una \ncuestión de \"desgaste\", \"mutaciones somáticas\", \ny \"entrecruzamiento\".  Esos problemas son reparables, y nuestro \nénfasis debe estar en la producción de energía y la prevención de \nlas condiciones que permiten la acumulación de estas señales indeseables. La ausencia de cáncer \nde una dieta carente de grasas, el aumento de la tasa de metabolismo, \ndisminución de producción de radicales libres, resistencia al estrés \ny la intoxicación por hierro, disminución del \nalcohol, endotoxinas, alloxan y Estreptozotocina, etc, mejora de la \nestructura y función del cerebro, disminución de la susceptibilidad \nde coágulos de sangre, así como de la obesidad y \npigmentos de edad, uilizando aceite de coco en lugar de grasas no saturadas, \nindica que algo muy simple que se puede hacer para reducir el sufrimiento \nde las principales enfermedades degenerativas, y que es muy probable \nque actúen mediante la reducción de la propio proceso de envejecimiento \nfisiológico, en su núcleo.

        "chunk_html": "RUOLO FISIOLOGICO DEL SALE (Na-Cl +)Dr. \nGiorgio Rossi -NMD - Bionutritionist Il cloruro \ndi sodio è il sale di sodio dell'acido cloridrico ed è il comune sale \nda cucina. A temperatura \nambiente si presenta come un solido cristallino incolore e inodore, dal \nsapore caratteristico. I suoi cristalli hanno un reticolo cubico ai \ncui vertici si \nalternano ioni sodio Na e ioni cloruro Cl . \nIn soluzione acquosa oppure fuso, conduce \ncorrente elettrica. Gia nel 1950, \nquando le industrie farmaceutiche iniziavano a promuovere nuovi prodotti con \nazione diuretica capaci di rimpiazzare i tradizionali composti di mercurio, iniziò \nad essere proposta sia dai media che da riviste scentifiche la dieta a base di riso \ncon basso tenore di sodio. I diuretici \nerano offerti per trattare la pressione sanguigna alta, gli edemi polmonari, problemi cardiaci, \n\"edemi idiopatici\", edemi ortostatici e obestià, e in altre \nforme di retenzione \ndi liquidi, includendo in questo la gravidanza; e dacchè tali diuretici funzionano \nattravereso l'escrezione di sodio dalle urine, le prescrizioni erano seguite da \navvertimenti di riduzione di apporto di sale per rendere l'effetto diuretico molto più \nefficace. Era chiaro \nche la restrizione di sale, specialmente combinata con la perdita di \nsale nelle urine, \nera veramente dannosa durante la gravidanza, ma la combinazione diventò uno \nstandard per la pratica medica per diversi anni, danneggiando così miglioni di \nbambini. A discapito \ndi molte pubblicazioni che dimostravano che i diuretici potevano causare problemi \ndi edemi che gli stessi erano supposti risolvere, divennero comunque dei \nrimedi molto redditizi per le case farmaceutiche. Così facendo \nle diete a restrizione di sale divennero un vero e proprio clichè culturale, \ninstillando tra l'altro la credenza erronea che il sodio causasse edemi \ne ipertensione. La restrizione \ndel sale, in accordo con oltre 100 studi (Alderman,2004), abbassa le pressione sanguigna \ndi pochissimi punti. Ma questo non è generalmetne collegato con un migliore \nstato di salute. In uno studio su oltre 3000 persone per circa 4 anni si rilevò \nun aumento della mortalità negli individi che utilizzavano meno sale. \nUn piccolo extra \ndi pochi grammi di sale giornaliero era associato con un 36% in meno di \"eventi \ncoronarici\" ( Alderman, et al, 1995) . In un altro studio con oltre \n11.000 persone in \ncirca 22 anni si dimostrò che vi era una relazione inversa tra l'opporto \ndi sale e mortalità \n( Alderman , et al, 1997). Da alcuni validi \nricercatori venne rilevata l'importanza nella nutrizione prenatale di educare verso \nun adeguato apporto di proteine ( specialmente quelle del latte), delle calorie, e \nil sale. Infatti era ormai in uso nelle donne in gravidanza il graduale abbandono del \nsale e dell'uso di diuretici. Infatti il \nsodio in associazione con l'albumina sierica, è essenziale per mantenere \nil volume del \nsangue. Senza un adeguato apporto di sodio, l'albumina sierica non è capace di trattenere \nl'acqua dal lasciare il sangue e conseguentemente quindi entrare nei \ntessuti. I tessuti si \ngonfiano non appena il volume del sangue si riduce. Durante la gravidanza, \nla riduzione del volume non nutre e non ossigena adeguatamente la crescita del \nfeto, e la ridotta circolazione renale causa il rilascio da parte dei \nreni di una sostanza \nsegnale ( la renina) che causa al sangue di circolare più velocemente, sotto una grande \npressione. Una dieta a basso apporto di sale è giusto una delle cose che possono \nridurre la circolazione e stimolare la produzione di renina. Le endotossine \nbatteriche, e altre cose che causano eccessiva permeabilità capillare, edemi, oppure \nsintomi come shock, attiveranno la secrezione di renina. Diversi studi \n(Shanklin and Hodin, 1979) sulla preeclampsia ( questa affezione fa aumentare la \npressione arteriosa e sono potenzialmente mortali per la madre e per \nil feto. Tale \naumento di pressione è accompagnato da edemi generalizzati, aumento \ndi peso improvviso \ndi 1,4 kg o maggiore per settimana, cefalea frontale intensa, visione ofuscata \no doppia, riduzione della portata urinaria, proteinuria, dolore addominale \ncentrale, irritabilità neuromuscolare, nausea e talvolta crisi convulsive che ci si riferisce \ncon il termine eclampsia) oppure tossiemia nella gravidanza dimostrano \nche supplementando la dieta con sale potrebbe favorire la diminuzione della pressione \nnelle donne gravide, e prevenire le altre complicazioni associate con la tossicità. L'elasticità \ndei vasi sanguigni è diminuita con la diminuzione del sale nella dieta. E' risaputo \ngià da molti anni che la diminuzione dell'apporto di sale causa una risposta da \nparte del corpo ( risposta adattiva), incrementando e quindi attivando \nil sistema renina-angiotensina-aldosterone \n(RAAS). L'attivazione di questo sistema è riconosciuto \ncome fattore nell'ipertensione, nelle malattie renali, nei problemi cardiaci, nelle \nfibrosi cardiaca, e in altri problemi. La restrizione di sodio fà incrementare \nanche la serotonina, l'attività del sistema simpatico, e PAI-1 ( plasminogen \nactivator inhibitor type-1), il quale contribuisce all'accumulazione \ndel coagulo ed \nè associato con il cancro alla prostata e al seno. Il sistema nervoso simpatico diviene \niperattivo nella preeclampsia (Metsaars, et al., 2006). A discapito \ndelle conoscenze generali della relazione del sale nella dieta e il \nsistema RAAS, la sua \napplicazione per la prevenzione della tossiemia in gravidanza, non è comunemente \napplicata anche ad altri problemi, come l'invecchiamento e le malattie degenerative \ncollegate con lo stress. Molte donne \ndurante il periodo mestruale hanno desiderio di sale o zucchero. Fisiologicamente \ne simile come durante la gravidanza. La retenzione di acqua durante il \nperido premestruale è un problema comune, e i medici comunemente offrono le \nstesse indicazioni per i ciclo mestruale che era offerto già come trattamento \nstandard per le donne in gravidanza: eliminazione di sale, alle volte \ncon un diuretico. \nMa quando le donne nel ciclo premestruale incrementano l'apporto di sale in accordo \ncon il loro desiderio , la retenzione di acqua può essere prevenuta. Il volume del \nsangue cambia durante il normale ciclo mestruale, e quando il volume del sangue \nè basso, è perchè l'acqua si è mossa indirizzata nei tessuti, causando quindi edema. \nQuando gli estrogeni sono alti, l'osmolarità del sangue è bassa ( Courtar, \net al, 2007; Stachenfeld, et al, 1999). L'aumento dell'adrenalina \ncausato dalla restrizione di sale ha molti effetti dannosi, includendo \ninsonnia. Molte persone anziane hanno riferito che una dieta a basso livello di \nsodio disturba il loro sonno, e che mangiando il loro normale livello \ndi sale ristabiliscono \nla loro abilità di sonno. L'attività del loro sistema nervoso simpatico (adrenergica) \naumenta con l'età, così la restrizione di sale esalta uno dei problemi base dell'età. \nL'aumento cronico dell'attivtà del sistema nervoso simpatico contribuisce \nalla permeabilità capillare, resistenza insulinica ( con incremento \ndegli acidi grassi \nliberi nel sangue) , e cambiamenti degenerativi nel cervello ( Griffth \nand Sutin, 1996). La comparsa \ndella tossicità nella gravianza e della preenclampsia aumentano la pressione sanguigna \ne la permeabilità capillare, e un aumento di prolattina. La secrezione \ndi prolattina è aumentata dalla serotonina, la quale è una delle sostanze che aumentano \ndalla restrizione del sale, ma la prolattina di per se può promuovere la perdita \ndi sale nelle urine (Ibarra, et al., 2005), e contribuisce alla permeabilità vascolare e \nalla ipertensione. In gravidanza, \nl'eccesso estrogenico e la deficienza di progesterone è un importante fattore negli \neffetti dannosi della restrizione di sodio e la deficienza di proteine. \nUna deficienza \ndi proteine contribuisce all'ipotiroidismo, il quale è responsabile \nper il relativo eccesso \nestrogenico. Le proteine, \nil sale, la tiroide, e il progesterone sono termogenici, aumentano quindi la produzione \ndi calore e stabilizzano quindi la temperatura corporea. La prolattina \ne gli estrogeni \nabbassano la temperatura basale. L'abbassamento \ndella temperatura e il metabolismo energetico nella tossiemia oppure nella \ndeprivazione del sale tendono ad abbassare l'utilizzo di ossigeno, aumentando \nl'uso glicolitico dello zucchero, e contribuendo alla formazione dell'acido \nlattico, più di quando il biossido di carbonio ( CO2). Nella preeclampsia, \nil livello sierico di lattato è aumentato, pur l'addove gli acidi grassi liberi \nstanno interferendo con l'uso del glucosio. Possiamo quindi \nanalizzare questi fatti considerando che la restrizione di sodio abbassa il \nmetabolismo, abbassa la produzione di biossido di carbonio, e crea infiammazione, \nstress e degenerazione. Rifrasando il tutto, il sodio stimola il metabolismo \nenergetico, aumenta la produzione di biossido di carbonio, e protegge contro le infiammazioni \ne altre reazioni di maladattamento allo stress. In anni recenti \nè sato dimostrato che intensificando la respirazione mitocondriale diminuisce \nil danno cellulare, e viene quindi supportata una durata di vita maggiore. Ad esempio \nmolti proprietari di cani sono consapevoli che i cani più piccoli mangiano molto \ndi più in proporzione alle loro dimensioni in rapporto a quelli più grandi. E infine \ni cani piccoli hanno una durata di vita molto più lunga dei cani di stazza più \ngrande, e in alcuni casi questa differenza si aggira a circa il doppio. Organismi differenti \ncome lieviti e roditori dimostrano simili associazioni di intensità \nmetabolica e durata di vita. Una varietà di criceti con un 20 % in \npiù di tasso metabolico \nvivono il 15% di più che criceti con un medio tasso metabolico. Le capacità \nindividuali dei topi allo sforzo era in relazione al loro tasso metabolico. I topi con \nun alto tasso metabolico usavano il 30 % di energia in più dei topi \na basso tasso metabolico, \noltre a vivere un 36% in più (I mitocondri di questi animali sono \"sganciati\", \nche vale a dire , il loro uso di ossigeno non è direttamente proporzionale \nalla produzione di ATP. Questo significa che essi stanno producendo molto biossido \ndi carbonio senza necessariamente produrre più ATP, e quando a riposo essi \nusano una considerevole quantità di energia). Una importante \nfunzione del biossido di carbonio è di regolare il movimento della carica positiva \ndeglio ioni metallici alcalini, come il sodio e il calcio. Quando troppo calcio entra \nnella cellula attiva molti enzimi, previene il rilassamento dei nervi \ne dei muscoli, e \nin ultimo uccide la cellula. La costante formazione di biossido di carbonio ( \nacido) nella cellula permette di rimuovere il calcio, ed una piccola quantità di \nsodio dalla quale è costantemente rifornita la cellula. Quando c' è \nun adeguato quantitativo di sodio nel fluido extracellulare, il continuo movimento degli \nioni sodio nella cellula a riposo attiva un enzima, il sodio-potassio ATPase, causando \nla formazione da ATP di ADP e fosfato, che stimola l'utilizzo di carburante \ne ossigeno per mantenere un adeguato livello di ATP. Incrementando la concentrazione \ndi sodio aumenta il consumo energetico e la produzione di biossido di carbonio \ndella cellula. Il sodio protegge contro l'eccitazione e gli effetti \ntossici del calcio intracellulare . Le soluzioni \nipertoniche, contenendo molto più sodio del normale ( circa da 2 a \n4-10 volte il normale) \nsono usate per \"rinvenire \" persone e animali dopo incidenti. Piuttosto che \nincrementare il volume del sangue nell'intento di ristabilire la circolazione, \nil fluido ipertonico di sodio ripristina la produzione di energia cellulare, aumentando \nil consumo di ossigeno e la produzione di calore mentre riduce la produzione \ndi radicali liberi, migliora la contrazione e il rilassamento del muscolo cardiaco, e \nriduce l'infiammazione , la permeabilità vascolare, e gli edemi. L'acqua di \nmare, che è ipertonica per i nostri tessuti, è stata inoltre usata \nper curare le ferite, \ne le concentrazioni salini sono state trovate molto efficaci per accellerare \nle guarigioni \ndi ferite. (Mangete, et al. 1993). Ci sono state \ndiverse pubblicazioni che suggerivano che un aumento di sale nella dieta può \ncausare cancro allo stomaco, poichè nei paesi come il Giappone con \nun alta incidenza \ndi questo tipo di cancro si ha un alto uso di sale. Sebbene cibo \npreservato incrementa molte delle caratteristiche tossine , anche il pesce fresco \nnella dieta è stato trovato essere associato con un incremento di rischio di \ncancro ( Phukan, et al., 2006). Quando a piccoli \nanimali veniva dato un millilitro di una soluzione saturata di sale con il carcinogeno, \nil numero dei tumori incrementava . Comunque, quando il sale era dato con \nmucina , non vi erano effetti carcinogeni. Dacchè un largo ammontare di soluzione \nsaturata di sale distruggeva la protezione naturale dello stomaco, le cellule dello \nstomaco non venivano protette dal carcinogeno. Quindi più che dimostrare \nche il sale causava cancro, l'esperimento dimostrava che una tazza o più di soluzione \ndi sale, oppure alcuni grammi si sale puro, non dovrebbero venire ingeriti nello \nstesso tempo con un forte carcinogeno. Alcuni studi \nhanno trovato che la carne di maiali è associata con cancro all'esofago \n(Nagai, et al., 1982), tiroide (Markaki, et al., 2003), e altri organi, \nma un esperimento \ncon manzo, pollo, oppure una dieta con pancetta nei ratti ha rilevato un altro ruolo \nin relazione al sale nel processo di carcinogenesi. Dopo aver ricevuto un carcinogeno, \ni ratti erano alimentati con una dieta a base di carne, contendo dal 30% al 60% \ndi manzo surgelato fritto, pollo e pancetta . E qui ne il manzo ne il \npollo cambiavanano \nl'incidenza delle lesioni precancerogene, ma l'incidenza era ridotta del 12% negli \nanimali con il 30% di dieta con pancetta, e del 20% in ratti con dieta \na 60% di pancetta. \nIl sale sembrava proprio fare la differenza. Altri effetti \nprotettivi dell'incremento del sodio sono che migliora il sistema immunitario( \nJunger, et al. 1994), riduce i danni vascolari , e allevia le infiammazioni( \nCara, et al., 1988) : tutti questi effetti dovrebbero tendere a proteggere \ncontro malattie degenerative, incluso tumori, ateriosclerosi, e Alzheimer. Il sistema \nRAAS appare essere crucialmente interessato in tutte le specie di malattie e degenerazioni, \nma gli effetti protettivi del sale sono molto importanti più di che \nun semplice aiuto \ndi prevenzione su questo sistema. Una leggera \ndiminuzione di temperatura può promuore l'infiammazione ( Matsui, et al., 2006). \nLe sostanze termogeniche dietetiche : proteine, sodio, saccarosio, tiroide e progesterone \nsono antiinfiammazione per molte ragioni, ma di per se è veramente importante \nl'aumento della temperatura . Un bassa reazione \nallo stress, con incremento del cortisolo, può aumentare la temperatura \ndel corpo attraverso l' accellerazione della distruzione e risintesi \ndelle proteine, ma \nuna resistenza adattiva per lo stress aumenta la temperatura attraverso \nl'incremento del consumo di ossigeno e carburante. In presenza di un incremento \ndi cortisolo, il grasso addominale aumenta, insieme con acidi grassi \ne calcio circolanti, \ndove invece la respirazione mitocondriale è soppressa. Quando i topi \nvengono messi in ambiente con bassa temperatura, essi spontaneamente \npreferiscono acqua leggermente salata, più di quanto fresca, e essi aumentano \nla loro produzione di calore (Dejima, et al., 1996). Quando ai ratti vengono dati \n0,9% di cloruro di sodio con il loro cibo, la loro produzione di temperatura \naumenta, e il loro grasso , incluso quello addominale, diminuisce( Bryant, et \nal, 1984). Questi risultati attraverso l'incremneto del sodio nella \ndieta sono immediati. \nParte dell'effetto del sodio comporta processi regolatori nel cervello, i \nquali sono molto sensibili al rapporto tra sodio e calcio. La diminuzione del sodio, \noppure l'incremento del calcio, causa il metabolsimo corporeo di allontanarsi \nsia dalla termogenesi che dall'accellerazione della respirazione. Regolando il \ncalcio intracelluare attraveso l'incremento della produzione di biossido di \ncarbonio è probabilmente un meccanismo base del sodio contro l'infiammazione \ne danni eccitatori a livello celluare e degenerativi. L'azione del \ncortisolo nel sopprimere la respirazione mitocondriale è associato molto fortemente \ncon la sua abilità di aumentare il calcio intracellualre. Il cortisolo blocca gli \neffetti termogenici del sodio, permettendo al calcio intracellulare \ndi danneggiare \nle cellule. Con l'età, i tessuti sono molto suscettibili a questi processi. Gli effetti \ntermogenici del sodio possono essere visti su un lungo studio, come \nsu uno breve. \nUn basso sodio nella dieta accellera il decremento della produzione \ndi calore che \nnormalmente avviene con l'età, abbassando il tasso metabolico delle cellule grasse \nbrune e la temperatura corporea, e aumentando il grasso contenuto nel corpo, \ncosi come l'attività della sintesi degli enzimi dei grassi. (Xavier, \net al., 2003). L'attivazione \ndella produzione di calore e l'incremento della temperatura può essere considerata \ncome un effetto dell'incremento del sodio simile al GABA .L'aumento del GABA nel \ncervello incrementa la produzione di calore dalle cellule grasse brune. ( Horton, et \nal., 1988). L'attivazione della produzione di calore attraverso le cellule grasse brune \nincrementa con onde lente durante il sonno. (Dewasmes, et al., 2003), la quale perdita \nè caratteristica dell'invecchiamento ( nell'uomo adulto, i muscoli scheletrici \nhanno la funzione di produrre calore simile alle cellule grasse brune). Ora che l'infiammazione \nè riconosciuta come nell 'avere un ruolo centrale nelle malattie degenerative, \nil fatto che la renina, angiotensina, e aldosterone contribuiscono \ntutti all'infiammazione e ad un loro aumento attraverso un deficienza \ndi sodio,dovrebbe destare interesse nell'esplorazione terapuetica della supplementazione \ndel sodio, e l'integrale uso di tutti quei fattori che normalmente supportano \nla produzione di energia, specialmente la tiroide e il progesterone. L'azione antagonista \nsull'aldosterone del progesterone è già risaputa da molti anni, e le \nmedicine sintetiche antagonizzanti l'adosterone sono povere imitazioni del progesterone. Ma le case \nfarmaceutiche sono interessate a vendere il loro prodotti medicinali \nper bloccare la \nformazione e l'azione di ogni componente del RASS, più di quando utilizzare \nun metodo meno costoso ( come la nutrizione) per normalizzare il sistema. Nota \nfinale : dato che questo mio elaborato è stato tratto dalle personali \nricerche e dall'insegnamento \ndel Prof. Raymond Peat, [ Ph. D in Biologia presso l'Università dell'Oregon \n(USA) , con specializzazione in fisiologia ] , \nrivolgo a lui sempre un grosso \nringraziamento per chiarirmi molto processi biochimici , \ntale lavoro non può essere \npubblicato se non dopo averne creata una completa elaborazione e arrichita con \naltra documentazione e ricerca personale o di gruppo e personali commenti.",

        "chunk_html": "The dark side of stress (learned helplessness)==========================================Acetylcholine is the \"neurotransmitter\" of cholinergic nerves, including the parasympathetic system.Cholinesterase (or acetylcholinesterase) is an enzyme that destroys acetylcholine, limiting the action of the cholinergic nerves.Attaching a phosphate group to the cholinesterase enzyme inactivates it, prolonging and intensifying the action of cholinergic stimulation.==========================================The autonomic nervous system has traditionally been divided into the sympathetic-adrenergic system, and the parasympathetic-cholinergic system, with approximately opposing functions, intensifying energy expenditure and limiting energy expenditure, respectively. The hormonal system and the behavioral system interact with these systems, and each is capable of disrupting the others. Disruptive factors in the environment have increased in recent decades.==========================================Living is development; the choices we make create our individuality. If genetically identical mice grow up in a large and varied environment, small differences in their experience will affect cell growth in their brains, leading to large differences in their exploratory behavior as they age (Freund, et al., 2013). Geneticists used to say that \"genes determine our limits,\" but this experiment shows that an environment can provide both limitations and opportunities for expanding the inherited potential. If our environment restricts our choices, our becoming human is thwarted, the way rats' potentials weren't discovered when they were kept in the standard little laboratory boxes. An opportunity to be complexly involved in a complex environment lets us become more of what we are, more humanly differentiated.A series of experiments that started at the University of California in 1960 found that rats that lived in larger spaces with various things to explore were better at learning and solving problems than rats that were raised in the standard little laboratory cages (Krech, et al., 1960). Studying their brains, they found that the enzyme cholinesterase, which destroys the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, was increased. They later found that the offspring of these rats were better learners than their parents, and their brains contained more cholinesterase. Their brains were also larger, with a considerable thickening of the cortex, which is considered to be the part mainly responsible for complex behavior, learning and intelligence.These processes aren't limited to childhood. For example, London taxi drivers who learn all the streets in the city develop a larger hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with memory.The 1960s research into environmental enrichment coincided with political changes in the US, but it went against the dominant scientific ideas of the time. Starting in 1945, the US government had begun a series of projects to develop techniques of behavior modification or mind control, using drugs, isolation, deprivation, and torture. In the 1950s, psychiatry often used lobotomies (about 80,000, before they were generally discontinued in the 1980s) and electroconvulsive \"therapy,\" and university psychologists tortured animals, often as part of developing techniques for controlling behavior.The CIA officially phased out their MKultra program in 1967, but that was the year that Martin Seligman, at the University of Pennsylvania, popularized the idea of \"learned helplessness.\" He found that when an animal was unable to escape from torture, even for a very short time, it would often fail to even try to escape the next time it was tortured. Seligman's lectures have been attended by psychologists who worked at Guantanamo, and he recently received a no-bid Pentagon grant of $31,000,000, to develop a program of \"comprehensive soldier fitness,\" to train marines to avoid learned helplessness.Curt Richter already in 1957 had described the \"hopelessness\" phenomenon in rats (“a reaction of hopelessness is shown by some wild rats very soon after being grasped in the hand and prevented from moving. They seem literally to give up,”) and even how to cure their hopelessness, by allowing them to have an experience of escaping once (Richter, 1957, 1958).  Rats which would normally be able to keep swimming in a tank for two or three days, would often give up and drown in just a few minutes, after having an experience of \"inescapable stress.\" Richter made the important discovery that the hearts of the hopeless rats slowed down before they died, remaining relaxed and filled with blood, revealing the dominant activity of the vagal nerve, secreting acetylcholine.The sympathetic nervous system (secreting noradrenaline) accelerates the heart, and is usually activated in stress, in the \"fight or flight\" reaction, but this radically different (parasympathetic) nervous activity hadn't previously been seen to occur in stressful situations. The parasympathetic, cholinergic, nervous system had been thought of as inactive during stress, and activated to regulate processes of digestion, sleep, and repair. Besides the cholinergic nerves of the parasympathetic system, many nerves of the central nervous system also secrete acetylcholine, which activates smooth muscles, skeletal muscles, glands, and other nerves, and also has some inhibitory effects. The parasympathetic nerves also secrete the enzyme, cholinesterase, which destroys acetylcholine. However, many other types of cell (red blood cells, fibroblasts, sympathetic nerves, marrow cells), maybe all cells, can secrete cholinesterase.Because cholinergic nerves have been opposed to the sympathetic, adrenergic, nerves, there has been a tendency to neglect their nerve exciting roles, when looking at causes of excitotoxicity, or the stress-induced loss of brain cells. Excessive cholinergic stimulation, however, can contribute to excitotoxic cell death, for example when it's combined with high cortisol and/or hypoglycemia.Drugs that block the stimulating effects of acetylcholine (the anticholinergics) as well as chemicals that mimic the effects of acetylcholine, such as the organophosphate insecticides, can impair the ability to think and learn. This suggested to some people that age-related dementia was the result of the deterioration of the cholinergic nerves in the brain. Drugs to increase the stimulating effects of acetylcholine in the brain (by inactivating cholinesterase) were promoted as treatment for Alzheimer's disease.Although herbal inhibitors were well known, profitable new drugs, starting with Tacrine, were put into use. It was soon evident that Tacrine was causing serious liver damage, but wasn't slowing the rate of mental deterioration.As the failure of the cholinergic drug Tacrine was becoming commonly known, another drug, amantadine (later, the similar memantine) was proposed for combined treatment. In the 1950s, the anticholinergic drug atropine was proposed a few times for treating dementia, and amantadine, which was also considered anticholinergic, was proposed for some mental conditions, including Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (Sanders and Dunn, 1973). It must have seemed odd to propose that an anticholinergic drug be used to treat a condition that was being so profitably treated with a pro-cholinergic drug, but memantine came to be classified as an anti-excitatory \"NMDA blocker,\" to protect the remaining cholinergic nerves, so that both drugs could logically be prescribed simultaneously. The added drug seems to have a small beneficial effect, but there has been no suggestion that this could be the result of its previously-known anticholinergic effects.Over the years, some people have suspected that Alzheimer's disease might be caused partly by a lack of purpose and stimulation in their life, and have found that meaningful, interesting activity could improve their mental functioning. Because the idea of a \"genetically determined hard-wired\" brain is no longer taught so dogmatically, there is increasing interest in this therapy for all kinds of brain impairment. The analogy to the Berkeley enrichment experience is clear, so the association of increasing cholinesterase activity with improving brain function should be of interest.The after-effect of poisoning by nerve gas or insecticide has been compared to the dementia of old age. The anticholinergic drugs are generally recognized for protecting against those toxins. Traumatic brain injury, even with improvement in the short term, often starts a long-term degenerative process, greatly increasing the likelihood of dementia at a later age. A cholinergic excitotoxic process is known to be involved in the traumatic degeneration of nerves (Lyeth and Hayes, 1992), and the use of anticholinergic drugs has been recommended for many years to treat traumatic brain injuries (e.g., Ward, 1950: Ruge, 1954; Hayes, et al., 1986).In 1976 there was an experiment (Rosellini, et al.) that made an important link between the enrichment experiments and the learned helplessness experiments. The control animals in the enrichment experiments were singly housed, while the others shared a larger enclosure. In the later experiment, it was found that the rats \"who were reared in isolation died suddenly when placed in a stressful swimming situation,\" while the group-housed animals were resistant, effective swimmers. Enrichment and deprivation have very clear biological meaning, and one is the negation of the other.The increase of cholinesterase, the enzyme that destroys acetylcholine, during enrichment, serves to inactivate cholinergic processes. If deprivation does its harm by increasing the activity of the cholinergic system, we should expect that a cholinergic drug might substitute for inescapable stress, as a cause of learned helplessness, and that an anticholinergic drug could cure learned helplessness. Those tests have been done: \"Treatment with the anticholinesterase, physostigmine, successfully mimicked the effects of inescapable shock.\" \"The centrally acting anticholinergic scopolamine hydrobromide antagonized the effects of physostigmine, and when administered prior to escape testing antagonized the disruptive effects of previously administered inescapable shock.\" (Anisman, et al., 1981.)This kind of experiment would suggest that the anticholinesterase drugs still being used for Alzheimer's disease treatment aren't biologically helpful. In an earlier newsletter I discussed the changes of growth hormone, and its antagonist somatostatin, in association with dementia: Growth hormone increases, somatostatin decreases. The cholinergic nerves are a major factor in shifting those hormones in the direction of dementia, and the anticholinergic drugs tend to increase the ratio of somatostatin to growth hormone. Somatostatin and cholinesterase have been found to co-exist in single nerve cells (Delfs, et al., 1984).Estrogen, which was promoted so intensively as prevention or treatment for Alzheimer's disease, was finally shown to contribute to its development. One of the characteristic effects of estrogen is to increase the level of growth hormone in the blood. This is just one of many ways that estrogen is associated with cholinergic activation. During pregnancy, it's important for the uterus not to contract. Cholinergic stimulation causes it to contract; too much estrogen activates that system, and causes miscarriage if it's excessive. An important function of progesterone is to keep the uterus relaxed during pregnancy. In the uterus, and in many other systems, progesterone increases the activity of cholinesterase, removing the acetylcholine which, under the influence of estrogen, would cause the uterus to contract.Progesterone is being used to treat brain injuries, very successfully. It protects against inflammation, and in an early study, compared to placebo, lowered mortality by more than half. It's instructive to consider its anticholinergic role in the uterus, in relation to its brain protective effects. When the brain is poisoned by an organophosphate insecticide, which lowers the activity of cholinesterase, seizures are likely to occur, and treatment with progesterone can prevent those seizures, reversing the inhibition of the enzyme (and increasing the activity of cholinesterase in rats that weren't poisoned) (Joshi, et al., 2010). Similar effects of progesterone on cholinesterase occur in menstrually cycling women (Fairbrother, et al., 1989), implying that this is a general function of progesterone, not just something to protect pregnancy. Estrogen, with similar generality, decreases the activity of cholinesterase. DHEA, like progesterone, increases the activity of cholinesterase, and is brain protective (Aly, et al., 2011).Brain trauma consistently leads to decreased activity of this enzyme (Östberg, et al., 2011; Donat, et al., 2007), causing the acetylcholine produced in the brain to accumulate, with many interesting consequences. In 1997, a group (Pike, et al.) created brain injuries in rats to test the idea that a cholinesterase inhibitor would improve their recovery and ability to move through a maze. They found instead that it reduced the cognitive ability of both the injured and normal rats. An anticholinergic drug, selegeline (deprenyl) that is used to treat Parkinson's disease and, informally, as a mood altering antiaging drug, was found by a different group (Zhu, et al., 2000) to improve cognitive recovery from brain injuries.One of acetylcholine's important functions, in the brain as elsewhere, is the relaxation of blood vessels, and this is done by activating the synthesis of NO, nitric oxide. (Without NO, acetylcholine constricts blood vessels; Librizzi, et al., 2000.) The basic control of blood flow in the brain is the result of the relaxation of the wall of blood vessels in the presence of carbon dioxide, which is produced in proportion to the rate at which oxygen and glucose are being metabolically combined by active cells. In the inability of cells to produce CO2 at a normal rate, nitric oxide synthesis in blood vessels can cause them to dilate. The mechanism of relaxation by NO is very different, however, involving the inhibition of mitochondrial energy production (Barron, et al., 2001). Situations that favor the production and retention of a larger amount of carbon dioxide in the tissues are likely to reduce the basic \"tone\" of the parasympathetic nervous system, as there is less need for additional vasodilation.Nitric oxide can diffuse away from the blood vessels, affecting the energy metabolism of nerve cells (Steinert, et al., 2010). Normally, astrocytes protect nerve cells from nitric oxide (Chen, et al., 2001), but that function can be altered, for example by bacterial endotoxin absorbed from the intestine (Solà, et al., 2002) or by amyloid-beta (Tran, 2001), causing them to produce nitric oxide themselves.Nitric oxide is increasingly seen as an important factor in nerve degeneration (Doherty, 2011). Nitric oxide activates processes (Obukuro, et al., 2013) that can lead to cell death. Inhibiting the production of nitric oxide protects against various kinds of dementia (Sharma & Sharma, 2013; Sharma & Singh, 2013). Brain trauma causes a large increase in nitric oxide formation, and blocking its synthesis improves recovery (Hüttemann, et al., 2008; Gahm, et al., 2006). Organophosphates increase nitric oxide formation, and the protective anticholinergic drugs such as atropine reduce it (Chang, et al., 2001; Kim, et al., 1997). Stress, including fear (Campos, et al., 2013) and isolation (ZlatkoviÄ & FilipoviÄ, 2013) can activate the formation of nitric oxide, and various mediators of inflammation also activate it. The nitric oxide in a person's exhaled breath can be used to diagnose some diseases, and it probably also reflects the level of their emotional well-being.The increase of cholinesterase by enriched living serves to protect tissues against an accumulation of acetylcholine. The activation of nitric oxide synthesis by acetylcholine tends to block energy production, and to activate autolytic or catabolic processes, which are probably involved in the development of a thinner cerebral cortex in isolated or stressed animals. Breaking down acetylcholine rapidly, the tissue renewal processes are able to predominate in the enriched animals.Environmental conditions that are favorable for respiratory energy production are protective against learned helplessness and neurodegeneration, and other biological problems that involve the same mechanisms. Adaptation to high altitude, which stimulates the formation of new mitochondria and increased thyroid (T3) activity, has been used for many years to treat neurological problems, and the effect has been demonstrated in animal experiments (Manukhina, et al., 2010). Bright light can reverse the cholinergic effects of inescapable stress (Flemmer, et al., 1990).During the development of learned helplessness, the T3 level in the blood decreases (Helmreich, et al., 2006), and removal of the thyroid gland creates the \"escape deficit,\" while supplementing with thyroid hormone before exposing the animal to inescapable shock prevents its development (Levine, et al., 1990). After learned helplessness has been created in rats, supplementing with T3 reverses it (Massol, et al., 1987, 1988).Hypothyroidism and excess cholinergic tone have many similarities, including increased formation of nitric oxide, so that similar symptoms, such as muscle inflammation, can be produced by cholinesterase inhibitors such as Tacrine, by increased nitric oxide, or by simple hypothyroidism (Jeyarasasingam, et al., 2000; Franco, et al., 2006).Insecticide exposure has been suspected to be a factor in the increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease (Zaganas, et al., 2013), but it could be contributing to many other problems, involving inflammation, edema, and degeneration. Another important source of organophosphate poisoning is the air used to pressurize airliners, which can be contaminated with organophosphate fumes coming from the engine used to compress it.Possibly the most toxic component of our environment is the way the society has been designed, to eliminate meaningful choices for most people. In the experiment of Freund, et al., some mice became more exploratory because of the choices they made, while others' lives became more routinized and limited. Our culture reinforces routinized living. In the absence of opportunities to vary the way you work and live to accord with new knowledge that you gain, the nutritional, hormonal and physical factors have special importance.Supplements of thyroid and progesterone are proven to be generally protective against the cholinergic threats, but there are many other factors that can be adjusted according to particular needs. Niacinamide, like progesterone, inhibits the production of nitric oxide, and also like progesterone, it improves recovery from brain injury (Hoane, et al., 2008). In genetically altered mice with an Alzheimer's trait, niacinamide corrects the defect (Green, et al., 2008). Drugs such as atropine and antihistamines can be used in crisis situations. Bright light, without excess ultraviolet, should be available every day.The cholinergic system is much more than a part of the nervous system, and is involved in cell metabolism and tissue renewal. Most people can benefit from reducing intake of phosphate, iron, and polyunsaturated fats (which can inhibit cholinesterase; Willis, et al., 2009), and from choosing foods that reduce production and absorption of endotoxin. And, obviously, drugs that are intended to increase the effects of nitric oxide (asparagine, zildenafil/Viagra, minoxidil/Rogaine) and acetylcholine (bethanechol, benzpyrinium, etc.) should be avoided.REFERENCESActa Biochim Pol. 2011;58(4):513-20.Neuroprotective effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in rat model of Alzheimer's disease.Aly HF, Metwally FM, Ahmed HH.Psychopharmacology (Berl). 1981;74(1):81-7.Cholinergic influences on escape deficits produced by uncontrollable stress.Anisman H, Glazier SJ, Sklar LS.Biochim Biophys Acta. 2001 Nov 1;1506(3):204-11.Endothelial- and nitric oxide-dependent effects on oxidative metabolism of intact artery.Barron JT, Gu L, Parrillo JE.Psychiatry Res. 1987 Jul;21(3):267-75.Triiodothyronine potentiation of antidepressant-induced reversal of learned helplessness in rats.Brochet DM, Martin P, Soubrié P, Simon P.Behav Brain Res. 2013 Aug 12. pii: S0166-4328(13)00482-8.Increased nitric oxide-mediated neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex is associated with the long lasting anxiogenic-like effect of predator exposure.Campos AC, Piorino EM, Ferreira FR, Guimarães FS.J Biomed Sci. 2001 Nov-Dec;8(6):475-83.Engagement of inducible nitric oxide synthase at the rostral ventrolateral medulla during mevinphos intoxication in the rat.Chang AY, Chan JY, Kao FJ, Huang CM, Chan SH.Science. 1984 Jan 6;223(4631):61-3.Coexistence of acetylcholinesterase and somatostatin-immunoreactivity in neurons cultured from rat cerebrum.Delfs JR, Zhu CH, Dichter MA.Neurosci Bull. 2011 Dec;27(6):366-82.Nitric oxide in neurodegeneration: potential benefits of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.Doherty GH.18.Brain Inj. 2007 Sep;21(10):1031-7.Alterations of acetylcholinesterase activity after traumatic brain injury in rats.Donat CK, Schuhmann MU, Voigt C, Nieber K, Schliebs R, Brust P.Environ Res. 1989 Aug;49(2):181-9.Influence of menstrual cycle on serum cholinesterase.Fairbrother A, Wagner SL, Welch S, Smith BB.Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 1990 Aug;36(4):775-8.Bright light blocks the capacity of inescapable swim stress to supersensitize a central muscarinic mechanism.Flemmer DD, Dilsaver SC, Peck JA.J Biol Chem. 2006 Feb 24;281(8):4779-86.Hypothyroid phenotype is contributed by mitochondrial complex I inactivation due to translocated neuronal nitric-oxide synthase.Franco MC, Antico Arciuch VG, Peralta JG, Galli S, Levisman D, López LM, Romorini L, Poderoso JJ, Carreras MC.J Neurotrauma. 2006 Sep;23(9):1343-54.Neuroprotection by selective inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase after experimental brain contusion.Gahm C, Holmin S, Wiklund PN, Brundin L, Mathiesen T.Exp Neurol. 2005 Jun;193(2):522-30.Progesterone suppresses the inflammatory response and nitric oxide synthase-2 expression following cerebral ischemia.Gibson CL, Constantin D, Prior MJ, Bath PM, Murphy SP.J Neurosci. 2008 Nov 5;28(45):11500-10.Nicotinamide restores cognition in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice via a mechanism involving sirtuin inhibition and selective reduction of Thr231-phosphotau.Green KN, Steffan JS, Martinez-Coria H, Sun X, Schreiber SS, Thompson LM, LaFerla FM.Cent Nerv Syst Trauma. 1986 Spring;3(2):163-73.Metabolic and neurophysiologic sequelae of brain injury: a cholinergic hypothesis.Hayes RL, Stonnington HH, Lyeth BG, Dixon CE, Yamamoto T.Physiol Behav. 2006 Jan 30;87(1):114-9.Peripheral triiodothyronine (T(3)) levels during escapable and inescapable footshock.Helmreich DL, Crouch M, Dorr NP, Parfitt DB.Neuroscience. 2008 Jun 26;154(3):861-8.

We therefore examined liver neuronal nitric-oxide synthase-alpha(nNOS) subcellular distribution as a putative mechanism for thyroid effects onrat metabolic rate. At low 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine levels, nNOS mRNA increasedby 3-fold, proteinexpression by one-fold, and nNOS was selectively translocatedto mitochondria without changes in other isoforms. In contrast, under thyroidhormone administration, mRNA level did not change and nNOS remained predominantlylocalized in cytosol. In hypothyroidism, nNOS translocation resulted in enhancedmitochondrial nitric-oxide synthase activity with low O2 uptake. In this context,NO utilization increased active O2 species and peroxynitrite yields and tyrosinenitration of complex I proteins that reduced complex activity. Hypothyroidism wasalso associated to high phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase anddecreased phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and cyclin D1 levels.Similarly to thyroid hormones, but without changing thyroid status, nitric-oxidesynthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased basalmetabolic rate, prevented mitochondrial nitration and complex I derangement, andturned mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and cyclin D1 expression backto control pattern. We surmise that nNOS spatial confinement in mitochondria is asignificant downstream effector of thyroid hormone and hypothyroid phenotype.Toxicology. 2013 May 10;307:3-11.Linking pesticide exposure and dementia: what is the evidence?Zaganas I, Kapetanaki S, Mastorodemos V, Kanavouras K, Colosio C, Wilks MF, Tsatsakis AM.J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2000 Oct;295(1):314-20.Nitric oxide is involved in acetylcholinesterase inhibitor-induced myopathy in rats.Jeyarasasingam G, Yeluashvili M, Quik M.Neuroreport. 2000 Apr 27;11(6):1173-6.Tacrine, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, induces myopathy.Jeyarasasingam G, Yeluashvili M, Quik M.Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Jan 11;290(1):97-104.NO synthesis, unlike respiration, influences intracellular oxygen tension.Coste J, Vial JC, Faury G, Deronzier A, Usson Y, Robert-Nicoud M, Verdetti J.We have developed a new phosphorescent probe, PdTCPPNa(4), whose luminescence properties are affected by local variations of intracellular oxygen tension (PO(2)). Spectrofluorometric measurements on living human umbilical venous endothelial cells loaded with this molecule show that a decrease in extracellular oxygen tension induces a decrease of PO(2), illustrating the phenomenon of oxygen diffusion and validating the use of this probe in living cells. Moreover, KCN- or 2,4-dinitrophenol-induced modifications of respiration do not lead to detectable PO(2) variations, probably because O(2) diffusion is sufficient to allow oxygen supply. On the contrary,activation by acetylcholine or endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which produces NO while consuming oxygen, induces a significant decrease in PO(2), whose amplitude is dependent on the acetylcholine dose, i.e., the eNOS activity level.Hence, activated cytosolic enzymes could consume high levels of oxygen which cannot be supplied by diffusion, leading to PO(2) decrease. Other cell physiology mechanisms leading to PO(2) variations can now be studied in living cells with this probe.Science. 1984 Jan 6;223(4631):61-3.Coexistence of acetylcholinesterase and somatostatin-immunoreactivity in neurons cultured from rat cerebrum.Delfs JR, Zhu CH, Dichter MA.Genes Nutr. 2009 December; 4(4): 309–314.Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids improve cholinergic transmission in the aged brainWillis LM, Shukitt-Hale B, Joseph JA.Toxicology. 2013 May 10;307:3-11.

Vasculardementia (VaD) has heterogeneous pathology and is a challenge for clinicians.Current Alzheimer's disease drugs have had limited clinical efficacy in treatingVaD and none have been approved by major regulatory authorities specifically forthis disease. Role of iNOS and NADPH-oxidase has been reported in variouspathological conditions but there role in hypertension (Hypt) induced VaD isstill unclear. This research work investigates the salutiferous effect ofaminoguanidine (AG), an iNOS inhibitor and 4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyacetophenone(HMAP), a NADPH oxidase inhibitor in Hypt induced VaD in rats.Deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-S) hypertension has been used fordevelopment of VaD in rats. Morris water-maze was used for testing learning andmemory. Vascular system assessment was done by testing endothelial function. Meanarterial blood pressure (MABP), oxidative stress [aortic superoxide anion, serumand brain thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and brain glutathione(GSH)], nitric oxide levels (serum nitrite/nitrate) and cholinergic activity(brain acetyl cholinesterase activity-AChE) were also measured. DOCA-S treatedrats have shown increased MABP with impairment of endothelial function, learningand memory, reduction in serum nitrite/nitrate & brain GSH levels along withincrease in serum & brain TBARS, and brain AChE activity. AG as well as HMAPsignificantly convalesce Hypt induced impairment of learning, memory, endothelialfunction, and alterations in various biochemical parameters. It may be concludedthat AG, an iNOS inhibitor and HMAP, a NADPH-oxidase inhibitor may be consideredas potential agents for the management of Hypt induced VaD.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

With recognition of its roles in synaptic plasticity (long-termpotentiation, LTP; long-term depression, LTD) and elucidation ofcalcium-dependent, NMDAR-mediated activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase(nNOS), numerous molecular and pharmacological tools have been used to explorethe physiology and pathological consequences for nitrergic signaling. In thisreview, the authors summarize the current understanding of this subtle signalingpathway, discuss the evidence for nitrergic modulation of ion channels andhomeostatic modulation of intrinsic excitability, and speculate about thepathological consequences of spillover between different nitrergic compartmentsin contributing to aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative disorders.Accumulating evidence points to various ion channels and particularlyvoltage-gated potassium channels as signaling targets, whereby NO mediatesactivity-dependent control of intrinsic neuronal excitability; such changes couldunderlie broader mechanisms of synaptic plasticity across neuronal networks. Inaddition,the inability to constrain NO diffusion suggests that spillover fromendothelium (eNOS) and/or immune compartments (iNOS) into the nervous systemprovides potential pathological sources of NO and where control failure in theseother systems could have broader neurological implications.Abnormal NO signalingcould therefore contribute to a variety of neurodegenerative pathologies such asstroke/excitotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson'sdisease.Neurosci Bull. 2011 Dec;27(6):366-82.

It has recently been shownthat pretreatment with thyroidhormone can prevent escape deficits produced by inescapable shock in an animalanalogue of depression.In this report we provide evidence thathypothyroidstatus can produce an escape deficit in rats.While sham-operated rats improvedtheir performance on a simple escape task over three days of testing,thyroparathyroidectomized rats showed a pronounced decrease in their responses.Markov transition analysis was used to obtain conditional probabilities ofescaping given a prior escape or failure to escape for the two groups. Thisanalysis shows that the structure of the data set may be similar for the twogroups. These results suggest that if intact rats learn to escape, thenhypothyroid rats may learn not to escape.1.

Chronic inescapable (forced)swim stress depletes brain biogenic amines and is used to produce learnedhelplessness in rats. Behavioral and biochemical characteristics of animals inthe state of learned helplessness lead some investigators to believe thiscondition provides a useful animal model of depression.Inescapable swim stressalso produces supersensitivity to the hypothermic effect of the muscarinicagonist oxotremorine in the rat.The authors previously demonstrated that brightlight potently induces subsensitivity of a central muscarinic mechanism involvedin the regulation of core temperature under a variety of circumstances. They nowreport using a repeated measures design that inescapable swim stress of five daysduration produces supersensitivity to oxotremorine (increase in thermic responseof 405%). Thissupersensitivity is reversed within five days by treatment withbright light, despite continuation of daily swim stress. Daily inescapable swimstress was continued beyond cessation of treatment with bright light.Five dayslater, supersensitivity to the hypothermic effect of oxotremorine was once againevident.Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 1986 Aug;25(2):415-21.Neurochemical and behavioral consequences of mild, uncontrollable shock: effectsof PCPA.Edwards E, Johnson J, Anderson D, Turano P, Henn FA.The present experiments examined the role of the serotonergic system in thebehavioral deficit produced by uncontrollable shock. In Experiment 1:Establishment of model, the behavioral potential of the Sprague-Dawley rat wasdefined. When exposed to mild uncontrollable stress such as a 0.8 mA electricfootshock, a significant percentage of rats developed a shock escape deficitwhich was evident when subsequently placed in a shock escape paradigm. Serotonindepletion was produced by chronic treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine. Biogenicamine levels and 5-HT levels were monitored in various brain areas using HPLC.Following chronic treatment with PCPA, the shock escape capability of theSprague-Dawley rat was assessed.The severe depletion of 5-HT in various brainregions was highly correlated with a dramatic improvement in the shock escapescores. Thus, the detrimental effects of exposure to a mild course of inescapableshock can be prevented by chronic treatment with PCPA. These experimentsimplicate the serotonergic system as a possible mediator of the \"learnedhelplessness\" phenomenon.Biol Psychiatry. 1985 Sep;20(9):1023-5.Triiodothyronine-induced reversal of learned helplessness in rats.Martin P, Brochet D, Soubrie P, Simon P.Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 1982 Nov;17(5):877-83.Evidence for a serotonergic mechanism of the learned helplessness phenomenon.Brown L, Rosellini RA, Samuels OB, Riley EP.The present experiments examined the role of the serotonergic system in thelearned helplessness phenomenon. In Experiment 1, a 200 mg/kg dose of1-tryptophan injected 30 min prior to testing disrupted acquisition of FixedRatio 2 shuttle escape behavior. In Experiment 2, a 100 mg/kg dose of 5-HTPproduced interference with the acquisition of the escape response. Furthermore,this interference was prevented by treatment with the serotonergic antagonistmethysergide. In Experiment 3, animals were pretreated with a subeffective doseof 1-tryptophan in combination with subeffective exposure to inescapable shock.These animals showed a deficit in the acquisition of FR-2 shuttle escape. InExperiment 4, combined exposure to a subeffective dose of 5-HTP and inescapableshock (40 trials) resulted in an acquisition deficit. This deficit was reversedby methysergide. Experiment 5 showed that the detrimental effects of exposure toprolonged (80 trials) of inescapable shock can be prevented by treatment withmethysergide. These studies implicate the serotonergic system as a possiblemediator of the learned helplessness phenomenon.45. Med Hypotheses. 2004;63(2):308-21. Brain cholinesterases: II. The molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer's disease. Shen ZX.2436 Rhode Island Avenue #3, Golden valley, MN 55427-5011, USA.zhengxshen@yahoo.comCurrently available evidence demonstrates that cholinesterases (ChEs), owing totheir powerful enzymatic and non-catalytic actions, unusually strongelectrostatics, andexceptionally ubiquitous presence and redundancy in theircapacity as the connector, the organizer and the safeguard of the brain,playfundamental role(s) in the well-being of cells, tissues, animal and human lives,while they present themselves adequately in quality and quantity. The widespreadintracellular and extracellular membrane networks of ChEs in the brain are alsosubject to various insults, such as aging, gene anomalies, environmental hazards,head trauma, excessive oxidative stress, imbalances and/or deficits of organicconstituents. The loss and the alteration of ChEs on the outer surface membranousnetwork may initiate the formation of extracellular senile plaques and induce anoutside-in cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The alteration in ChEs on theintracellular compartments membranous network may give rise to the development ofintracellular neurofibrillary tangles and induce an inside-out cascade of AD. Theabnormal patterns of glycosylation and configuration changes in ChEs may bereflecting their impaired metabolism at the molecular and cellular level andcausing the enzymatic and pharmacodynamical modifications and neurotoxicitydetected in brain tissue and/or CSF of patients with AD and in specimens inlaboratory experiments. The inflammatory reactions mainly arising fromChEs-containing neuroglial cells may facilitate the pathophysiologic process ofAD. It is proposed that brain ChEs may serve as a central point rallying varioushypotheses regarding the etio-pathogenesis of AD.3.

A decrease of AchE activity (20-35%) was found in thehippocampus and hypothalamus already at 2 hours after TBI.An increase ofapproximately 30% was found in the basal forebrain at 2 and 24 hours. No changesoccurred at 72 hours.CONCLUSION: The findings are consistent with impairment of the cholinergicneurotransmission after TBI and suggest the involvement of the AChE in short-termregulatory mechanisms.35.

Inhistochemical preparations stained for acetylcholinesterase (AChE),there was amarked loss of large AChE reactive neurons within and beneath the nbm on theinjected side, and the AChE positive fibers were greatly decreased particularlyin the IV-VI layers of the frontal and parietal cortices ipsilateral to thekainate lesion. Using in vitro receptor autoradiography, we found a significantincrease (about 25%) in 3H-QNB binding sites in the I-IV layers of theipsilateral frontal and parietal cortices (p 0.05, Student's t-test).The areawith decreased AChE activityand increased density in 3H-QNB binding sitescorresponded to the innervation of the cholinergic system arising from the nbm.The increase of density in 3H-QNB binding sites was considered to reflect thepostsynaptic denervation supersensitivity.36.

Severe toxic signs were noted following one LD50 doseadministration of all the compounds, yet only soman induced brain lesions.Moreover, even when administered at a sublethal dose (0.5 LD50), soman inducedsome histological changes without any clinical signs of intoxication.Soman-induced brain lesions were assessed quantitatively using a computerizedimage analyser. The analysis was carried out for up to 3 months followingadministration, and a dynamic pattern of pathology was shown. The corticalthickness and area of CA1 and CA3 cells declined significantly as early as 1 weekpost-exposure. No pathological findings were detected following DFP and metrazoladministration. It is therefore suggested that brain lesions are not common forall ChE inhibitors and that convulsions per se are not the only factor leading tobrain damage following the administration of soman. The degenerative process(found also with the sublethal dose of soman) might be due to a secondary effect,unrelated to soman's clinical toxicity, but leading to long-term brain injuries.42.

In addition, novel cholinomimetic therapeutics have been demonstrated toimprove cognitive outcome following TBI in rats. We examined the effects ofrepeated postinjury administration of a cholinesterase inhibitor,tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA), on cognitive performance following experimentalTBI. Rats were either injured at a moderate level of central fluid percussion TBI(2.1+/-0.1 atm) or were surgically prepared but not delivered a fluid pulse (shaminjury). Beginning 24 h after TBI or sham injury, rats were injected (IP) dailyfor 15 days with an equal volume (1.0 ml/kg) of either 0.0, 1.0, 3.0, or 9.0mg/kg THA (TBI: n = 8, 8, 10, and 7, respectively, and Sham: n = 5, 7, 8, 7,respectively). Cognitive performance was assessed on Days 11-15 after injury in aMorris water maze (MWM).Analysis of maze latencies over days indicated thatchronic administration of THA produced a dose-related impairment in MWMperformance in both the injured and sham groups, with the 9.0 mg/kg doseproducing the largest deficit. The 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg doses of THA impaired MWMperformance without affecting swimming speeds. Thus, the results of thisinvestigation do not support the use of THA as a cholinomimetic therapeutic forthe treatment of cognitive deficits following TBI.43.

The potential effects of low level exposure are less well defined. Themost reliable data comes from controlled clinical trials with specific agents. Asingle dose of sarin or repeated doses of metrifonate or mevinphos, have producedonly transient adverse effects at doses causing substantial acetylcholinesteraseinhibition. Other data comes from epidemiological surveys. These have often usedmore sensitive indices than the clinical studies, but are less reliable due tothe difficulty of defining exposure and matching control and exposed populations.Subtle, mainly cognitive, differences between exposed and non-exposed populationsare sometimes seen. Low level exposure can cause a reversible down-regulation ofcholinergic systems, and a range of non-cholinesterase effects that arestructure-specific, and do not always parallel acute toxicity. Novel proteintargets sensitive to low level exposure to some organophosphates are known toexist in the brain, but their functional significance is not yet understood.44.

In contrast to percussiveTBI alone, this combined injury induces maladaptive hippocampal plasticity.Recent reports suggest a potential role for dopamine in CNS plasticity aftertrauma. We have examined the effect of the dopamine enhancer l-deprenyl oncognitive function and neuroplasticity following TBI. Rats received fluidpercussion TBI, BEC alone, or combined TBI + BEC lesion and were treated oncedaily for 7 days with l-deprenyl, beginning 24 h after TBI alone and 15 min afterBEC or TBI + BEC. Postinjury motor assessment showed no effect of l-deprenyltreatment. Cognitive performance was assessed on days 11-15 postinjury and brainsfrom the same cases examined for dopamine beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity(DBH-IR) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry. Significant cognitiveimprovement relative to untreated injured cases was observed in both TBI groupsfollowing l-deprenyl treatment; however, no drug effects were seen with BECalone. l-Deprenyl attenuated injury-induced loss in DBH-IR over CA1 and CA3 afterTBI alone. However, after combined TBI + BEC, l-deprenyl was only effective inprotecting CA1 DBH-IR. AChE histostaining in CA3 was significantly elevated withl-deprenyl in both injury models.After TBI + BEC, l-deprenyl also increased AChEin the dentate molecular layer relative to untreated injured cases. These resultssuggest that dopaminergic/noradrenergic enhancement facilitates cognitiverecovery after brain injury and that noradrenergic fiber integrity is correlatedwith enhanced synaptic plasticity in the injured hippocampus.Copyright 2000 Academic Press.J Neurotrauma. 1992 May;9 Suppl 2:S463-74.Cholinergic and opioid mediation of traumatic brain injury.Lyeth BG, Hayes RL.Psychosom Med. 1976 Jan-Feb;38(1):55-8.Sudden death in the laboratory rat.Rosellini RA, Binik YM, Seligman MP.Vulnerability to sudden death was produced in laboratory rats by manipulatingtheir developmental history.

The aim ofthe present studies was to explore the possibility that N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptor activation and nitric oxide (NO) formation within the DRN mightbe involved in mediating the behavioral consequences of IS. To this end, eitherthe NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) or the nitricoxide synthase inhibitor Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), wasmicroinjected into the DRN before IS or before testing 24 h later. Blocking NMDAreceptors with APV in the DRN during IS prevented the usual impact of IS onescape responding and conditioned fear. However, injection of APV at the time oftesting only reduced these effects. The DRN was shown to be the critical sitemediating blockade of these behavioral changes since injection of APV lateral tothe DRN did not alter the behavioral consequences of IS. Conversely, L-NAME wasmost effective in reversing the effects of IS when administered at the time oftesting. These results suggest that there is glutamatergic input to the DRN atthe time of IS that produces long-lasting changes in DRN sensitivity. Thisplasticity in the DRN is discussed as a possible mechanism by which IS leads tochanges in escape performance and conditioned fear responding.and prolonged depression causes shrinkage of this area. The high cortisol associated with depression is undoubtedly one of the factors causing brain shrinkage during stress. Cushing's disease, in which the adrenal glands produce far too much cortisol, causes shrinkage of the brain, and when the disease is cured by normalizing the level of cortisol, the brain size is restored.There are two very different kinds of stress reaction. The best known \"fight or flight reaction\" could be called more accurately \"struggle to adapt.\" Another, less discussed kind, might appear to be a \"give up and die or get depressed\" reaction, but it involves many processes that are protective and adaptive in certain circumstances.tone and heart rate;drown easily.

The purpose of the presentstudy was to elucidate if tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), interferon γ (IFNG),and/or progesterone (P4) play roles in regulating NO generating system in LECs.Cultured bovine LECs obtained from the CL at the mid-luteal stage (Days 8-12 ofthe cycle) were treated for 24 hr with TNF (2.9 nM), IFNG (2.5 nM), or P4(0.032-32 µM). NO production was increased by TNF and IFNG, but decreased by P4(P < 0.05). TNF and IFNG stimulated the relative steady-state amounts ofinducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and iNOS protein expression(P < 0.05), whereas P4 inhibited relative steady-state amounts of iNOS mRNA andiNOS protein expression (P < 0.05). In contrast, endothelial nitric oxidesynthase (eNOS) expression was not affected by any treatment. TNF and IFNGstimulated NOS activity (P < 0.05) and 1400W, a specific inhibitor of iNOS,reduced NO production stimulated by TNF and IFNG in LECs (P < 0.05). Onapristone,a specific P4 receptor antagonist, blocked the inhibitory effect of P4 on NOproduction in LECs (P < 0.05). The overall findings suggest that TNF and IFNGaccelerate luteolysis by increasing NO production via stimulation of iNOSexpression and NOS activity in bovine LECs. P4, on the other hand, may act inmaintaining CL function by suppressing iNOS expression in bovine LECs. Mol.Reprod.

Progesterone neuroprotection hasbeen reported for several CNS diseases, including the Wobbler mouseneurodegeneration. In the present study, we analyzed progesterone effects onmitochondrial-associated parameters of symptomatic Wobbler mice. The activitiesof mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, II-III and IV and protein levelsof mitochondrial and cytosolic NOS were determined in cervical and lumbar cordsfrom control, Wobbler and Wobbler mice receiving a progesterone implant for 18days. We found a significant reduction of complex I and II-III activities inmitochondria and increased protein levels of mitochondrial, but not cytosolicnNOS, in the cervical cord of Wobbler mice.Progesterone treatment prevented thereduction of complex I in the cervical region and the increased level ofmitochondrial nNOS.Wobbler motoneurons also showed accumulation of amyloidprecursor protein immunoreactivity and decreased activity and immunostaining ofMnSOD. Progesterone treatment avoided these abnormalities. Therefore,administration of progesterone to clinically afflicted Wobblers (i) prevented theabnormal increase of mitochondrial nNOS and normalized respiratory complex I;(ii) decreased amyloid precursor protein accumulation, a sign of axonaldegeneration, and (iii) increased superoxide dismutation. Thus, progesteroneneuroprotection decreases mitochondriopathy of Wobbler mouse cervical spinalcord.© 2012 The Authors.

The beta-adrenergic antagonist, (+/-)-propranolol (1 and10 mg/kg), as well as the beta-agonist, isoproterenol (0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg)potentiated the gastric pathology. On the other hand, the alpha-agonist,clonidine (0.5 mg/kg) attenuated and the alpha-antagonist, yohimbine (1 mg/kg)aggravated stress ulcer development. The anticholinergic agent, atropinemethylnitrate (1 mg/kg), reduced both the frequency and severity of stress ulcersand also antagonized the potentiating effects of (+/-)-propranolol, isoproterenoland yohimbine.

When escape was possible upon shock onset, the drug treatment did notinfluence performance.The centrally acting anticholinergic scopolaminehydrobromide antagonized the effects of physostigmine, and when administeredprior to escape testing antagonized the disruptive effects of previouslyadministered inescapable shock.In contrast, the peripherally acting agentscopolamine methylbromide did not influence the effects of these treatments,suggesting that the effects of physostigmine and inescapable shock involvedcentral ACh changes. Scopolamine hydrobromide administered prior to inescapableshock did not prevent the escape interference from subsequently appearing, butthis effect could not be attributed to state dependence. It was argued that theinterference of escape following uncontrollable stress was due to non-associativemotor deficits. Alterations of the escape deficits by scopolamine were due toelimination of the motor disruption.Curr Opin Oncol. 2005 Jan;17(1):55-60.DNA methylation and cancer therapy: new developments and expectations.Esteller M.Cancer Epigenetics Laboratory, Spanish National Cancer Centre (CNIO) Madrid,Spain.mesteller@cnio.esPURPOSE OF REVIEW: In addition to having genetic causes, cancer can also beconsidered an epigenetic disease. The main epigenetic modification is DNAmethylation, and patterns of aberrant DNA methylation are now recognized to be acommon hallmark of human tumors. One of the most characteristic features is theinactivation of tumor-suppressor genes by CpG-island hypermethylation of the CpGislands located in their promoter regions. These sites, among others, are thetargets of DNA-demethylating agents, the promising chemotherapeutic drugs thatare the focus of this article.RECENT FINDINGS: Four exciting aspects have recently arisen at the forefront ofthe advancements in this field: first, the development of new compounds withDNA-demethylating capacity that are less toxic (for example, procaine) and may beadministered orally (for example, zebularine);Science. 2013 May 10;340(6133):756-9.Emergence of individuality in genetically identical mice.Freund J, Brandmaier AM, Lewejohann L, Kirste I, Kritzler M, Krüger A, Sachser N,Lindenberger U, Kempermann G.CRTD-DFG Research Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, TechnischeUniversität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.Comment inScience. 2013 May 10;340(6133):695-6.Brain plasticity as a neurobiological reflection of individuality is difficult tocapture in animal models. Inspired by behavioral-genetic investigations of humanmonozygotic twins reared together, we obtained dense longitudinal activity dataon 40 inbred mice living in one large enriched environment. The exploratoryactivity of the mice diverged over time, resulting in increasing individualdifferences with advancing age. Individual differences in cumulative roamingentropy, indicating the active coverage of territory, correlated positively withindividual differences in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our results show thatfactors unfolding or emerging during development contribute to individualdifferences in structural brain plasticity and behavior. The paradigm introducedhere serves as an animal model for identifying mechanisms of plasticityunderlying nonshared environmental contributions to individual differences inbehavior.Neurobiol Aging. 1995 Jul-Aug;16(4):523-30.Delayed onset of Alzheimer's disease with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory andhistamine H2 blocking drugs.Breitner JC, Welsh KA, Helms MJ, Gaskell PC, Gau BA, Roses AD, Pericak-Vance MA,Saunders AM.If each opportunity we have to choose expands our curiosity,we go beyond our inheritance to become something unique but also universal, that is, more fully human.J Neurobiol. 1976 Jan;7(1):75-85.

BW813U (100 mg/kg, IP) produced a rapid (within 1 hour) and substantialdecrease in ChAT activity throughout the brain, ranging from 66% (hippocampus) to80% (caudate nucleus) that lasted up to 5 days.A single injection (50 mg/kg, IP)into rats with lesions (using ibotenic acid) in the nucleus basalismagnocellularis and medial septal area, decreased ChAT activity by 75% and 60% inthe cortex and hippocampus, respectively. Lesioned and unlesioned rats weretrained on the radial arm maze until they reached a criterion level ofperformance.Each rat then received an injection of BW813U (50 or 100 mg/kg, IP).Choice accuracy was not impaired at any time following the injection. The lack ofeffect on performance may be due to 2 possible factors: The radial maze retentionparadigm chosen may not be sufficiently difficult, or the decrease inacetylcholine production was not sufficient to affect behavior. Compensation bynon-cholinergic neural systems might account for the insensitivity of the rats tosignificant cholinergic depletion.Psychol Aging. 1988 Dec;3(4):399-406.Genotype-environment interaction in personality development: identical twins reared apart.Bergeman CS, Plomin R, McClearn GE, Pedersen NL, Friberg LT.Center for Developmental and Health Genetics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802.The focus of this study is to identify specific genotype-environment (GE) interactions as they contribute to individual differences in personality in later life. In behavioral genetics, GE interaction refers to the possibility that individuals of different genotypes may respond differently to specific environments. A sample of 99 pairs of identical twins reared apart, whose average age is 59 years, has been studied as part of the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA). Hierarchical multiple regression was used to detect interactions between personality and environmental measures after the main effects of genotype and environment were removed. Analyses yield evidence for 11 significant interactions that provide the first evidence for GE interaction in human development using specific environmental measures. Thus, in addition to the main-effect contributions of heredity and environment, GE interactions contribute to individual differences in personality as measured in the second half of the life course.Wikipedia:Excitability and inhibition[edit source|editbeta]Acetylcholine also has other effects on neurons. One effect is to cause a slowdepolarization[citation needed]by blocking a tonically active K+current, which increases neuronal excitability. Alternatively, acetylcholine can activate non-specific cation conductances to directly excite neurons.[10]An effect upon postsynapticM4-muscarinic ACh receptorsis to openinward-rectifier potassium ion channel(Kir) and cause inhibition.[11]The influence of acetylcholine on specific neuron types can be dependent upon the duration of cholinergic stimulation. For instance, transient exposure to acetylcholine (up to several seconds) can inhibit cortical pyramidal neurons via M1 type muscarinic receptors that are linked to Gq-type G-protein alpha subunits.M1 receptor activation can induce calcium-release from intracellular stores, which then activate a calcium-activated potassium conductance which inhibitspyramidal neuron firing.[12]On the other hand, tonic M1 receptor activation is strongly excitatory.Thus, ACh acting at one type of receptor can have multiple effects on the same postsynaptic neuron, depending on the duration of receptor activation.[13]Recent experiments in behaving animals have demonstrated that cortical neurons indeed experience both transient and persistent changes in local acetylcholine levels during cue-detection behaviors.[14]In the cerebral cortex, tonic ACh inhibits layer 4medium spiny neurons, the main targets of thalamocortical inputs while excitingpyramidal cellsin layers 2/3 and layer 5.[11]This filters out weak sensory inputs in layer 4 and amplifies inputs that reach the layers 2/3 and layer L5 excitatory microcircuits. As a result, these layer-specific effects of ACh might function to improve the signal noise ratio of cortical processing.[11]At the same time, acetylcholine acts through nicotinic receptors to excite certain groups of inhibitory interneurons in the cortex, which further dampen down cortical activity.[15]Role in decision making[edit source|editbeta]One well-supported function of acetylcholine (ACh) in cortex is increased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, a form ofattention.Phasicincreases of ACh during visual,[16]auditory[17]and somatosensory[18]stimulus presentations have been found to increase the firing rate of neurons in the corresponding primary sensory cortices. When cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain are lesioned, animals' ability to detect visual signals was robustly and persistently impaired.[19]In that same study, animals' ability to correctly reject non-target trials was not impaired, further supporting the interpretation that phasic ACh facilitates responsiveness to stimuli. Looking at ACh's effect on thalamocortical connections, a known pathway of sensory information, in vitro application of cholinergicagonistcarbacholto mouse auditory cortex enhanced thalamocortical activity.[20]In addition, Gil et al. (1997) applied a different cholinergic agonist,nicotine, and found that activity was enhanced at thalamocortical synapses.[21]This finding provides further evidence for a facilitative role of ACh in transmission of sensory information from the thalamus to selective regions of cortex.An additional suggested function of ACh in cortex is suppression of intracortical information transmission. Gil et al. (1997) applied the cholinergic agonistmuscarineto neocortical layers and found thatexcitatory post-synaptic potentialsbetween intracortical synapses were depressed.[21]In vitro application of cholinergic agonist carbachol to mouse auditory cortex suppressed intracortical activity as well.[20]Optical recording with a voltage-sensitive dye in rat visual cortical slices demonstrated significant suppression in intracortical spread of excitement in the presence of ACh.[22]Some forms of learning and plasticity in cortex appear dependent on the presence of acetylcholine. Bear et al. (1986) found that the typical synaptic remapping instriate cortexthat occurs duringmonocular deprivationis reduced when there is a depletion of cholinergic projections to that region of cortex.[23]Kilgard et al. (1998) found that repeated stimulation of thebasal forebrain, a primary source of ACh neurons, paired with presentation of a tone at a specific frequency, resulted in remapping of theauditory cortexto better suit processing of that tone.[24]Baskerville et al. (1996) investigated the role of ACh inexperience-dependent plasticityby depleting cholinergic inputs to thebarrel cortexof rats.[25]The cholinergic depleted animals had a significantly reduced amount of whisker-pairing plasticity. Apart from the cortical areas, Crespo et al. (2006) found that the activation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in thenucleus accumbensis necessary for the acquisition of an appetitive task.[26]ACh has been implicated in the reporting of expected uncertainty in the environment[27]based both on the suggested functions listed above and results recorded while subjects perform a behavioral cuing task.Reaction timedifference between correctly cued trials and incorrectly cued trials,called the cue validity, was found to vary inversely with AChlevels in primates with pharmacologically (e.g. Witte et al., 1997) and surgically (e.g. Voytko et al., 1994) altered levels of ACh.[28][29]The result was also found inAlzheimer's diseasepatients (Parasuraman et al., 1992) and smokers after nicotine (an ACh agonist) consumption.[30][31]The inverse covariance is consistent with the interpretation of ACh as representing expected uncertainty in the environment, further supporting this claim.12•.^Gulledge, AT; Stuart, GJ (2005). \"Cholinergic inhibition of neocortical pyramidal neurons\".Journal of Neuroscience25(44): 10308–20.doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2697-05.2005.PMID16267239.^Gulledge, AT; Bucci, DJ; Zhang, SS; Matsui, M; Yeh, HH (2009).\"M1 Receptors Mediate Cholinergic Modulation of Excitability in Neocortical Pyramidal Neurons\".Journal of Neuroscience29(31): 9888–902.doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1366-09.2009.PMC2745329.PMID19657040.^Parikh, V; Kozak, R; Martinez, V; Sarter, M (2007).\"Prefrontal acetylcholine release controls cue detection on multiple time scales\".Neuron56(1): 141–54.doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2007.08.025.PMC2084212.PMID17920021.^Gulledge, AT; Park, SB; Kawaguchi, Y; Stuart, GJ (2007). \"Heterogeneity of phasic cholinergic signaling in neocortical neurons\".Journal of neurophysiology97(3): 2215–29.doi:10.1152/jn.00493.2006.PMID17122323.^Spehlmann R, Daniels JC, Smathers CC (1971).\"Acetylcholine and the synaptic transmission of specific impulses to the visual cortex\".Brain94(1): 125–38.doi:10.1093/brain/94.1.125.PMID4324030.^Foote SL, Freedman R, Oliver AP (March 1975).\"Effects of putative neurotransmitters on neuronal activity in monkey auditory cortex\".Brain Res.86(2): 229–42.doi:10.1016/0006-8993(75)90699-X.PMID234774.^Stone TW (September 1972).\"Cholinergic mechanisms in the rat somatosensory cerebral cortex\".J.

AD patients show reduction ofcerebral blood flow (CBF), the extent of the reduction correlating with theimpairment of cognition.There is evidence that cerebral hypoperfusion precedesand may even trigger the onset of dementia in AD. Cerebral hypoperfusion impairsneuronal function, reduces the clearance of Aβ peptide and other toxicmetabolites from the brain, and upregulates Aβ production. Studies in animalmodels of AD have shown the reduction in CBF to be more than would be expectedfor the reduction in neuronal metabolic activity.Aβ may contribute to thereduction in CBF in AD, as both Aβââââand Aβââââinduce cerebrovasculardysfunction. Aβââââacts directly on cerebral arteries to cause cerebral smoothmuscle cell contraction. Aβââââcauses increased neuronal production and releaseof endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, and upregulation ofendothelin-converting enzyme-2 (ECE-2), the enzyme which cleaves ET-1 from itsinactive precursor. ET-1 and ECE-2 are also elevated in AD, making it likely thatupregulation of the ECE-2-ET-1 axis by Aβââââcontributes to the chronicreduction of CBF in AD. At present, only a few symptomatic treatment optionsexist for AD. The involvement of ET-1 in the pathogenesis of endothelialdysfunction associated with elevated Aβ indicates the potential for endothelinreceptor antagonists in the treatment of AD. It has already been demonstratedthat the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan, preserves aortic and carotidendothelial function in Tg2576 mice, and our findings suggest that endothelinreceptor antagonists may be beneficial in maintaining CBF in AD.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Chemical lesioning of the ventral subiculum impaired the spatial learning performances in rats. The lesion also induced a significant degree of neurodegeneration in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Exposure to enriched housing conditions improved the behavioral performance and partially attenuated the neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. The choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) activity in the hippocampus remained unchanged following ventral subicular lesion and also following exposure to an enriched environment. The study implicates the effectiveness of activity-dependent neuronal plasticity induced by environmental enrichment in adulthood following brain insult.Copyright (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved.Horm Behav. 2013 Jul 27. pii: S0018-506X(13)00139-6.Progesterone and vitamin D: Improvement after traumatic brain injury in middle-aged rats.Tang H, Hua F, Wang J, Sayeed I, Wang X, Chen Z, Yousuf S, Atif F, Stein DG.Department of Emergency Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.Progesterone (PROG) and vitamin D hormone (VDH) have both shown promise in treating traumatic brain injury (TBI). Both modulate apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, andexcitotoxicity.We investigated whether 21days of VDH deficiency would alter cognitive behavior after TBI and whether combined PROG and VDH would improve behavioral and morphological outcomes more than either hormone alone in VDH-deficient middle-aged rats given bilateral contusions of the medial frontal cortex. PROG (16mg/kg) and VDH (5μg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally 1h post-injury. Eight additional doses of PROG were injected subcutaneously over 7days post-injury. VDH deficiency itself did not significantly reduce baseline behavioral functions or aggravate impaired cognitive outcomes. Combination therapy showed moderate improvement in preserving spatial and reference memory but was not significantly better than PROG monotherapy. However, combination therapy significantly reduced neuronal loss and the proliferation of reactive astrocytes, and showed better efficacy compared to VDH or PROG alone in preventing MAP-2 degradation. VDH+PROG combination therapy may attenuate some of the potential long-term, subtle, pathophysiological consequences of brain injury in older subjects.© 2013.KEYWORDS:Yang, glutamate stimulates DNA repair; methylation of dna during stress, hydrophobicLife Sci 1998;62(17-18):1717-21Induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase and heme oxygenase-1 inrat glial cells.Kitamura Y, Matsuoka Y, Nomura Y, Taniguchi TDepartment of Neurobiology, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Japan.Recent observations suggest a possible interaction between the nitric oxide (NO)/NO synthases and carbon monoxide (CO)/heme oxygenases systems. We examined the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and NO donor such as S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) on induction of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in mixed glial cells and in rat hippocampus. In in vitro glial cells, treatment with LPS induced the expression of 130-kDa iNOS after 6h, and NO2- accumulation and enhancement of the protein level of 33-kDa HO-1 after 12 h. In addition, treatment with SNAP induced HO-1 expression after 6 h. Although a NOS inhibitor, such as N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (NNA), did not change LPS-induced iNOS expression, the inhibitor suppressed both NO2- accumulation and the enhancement of HO-1.Immunocytochemistry showed that LPS-treatment induced iNOS-immunoreactivity predominantly in microglia, while this treatment induced HO-1-immunoreactivity in both microglia and astrocytes. These results suggest that endogenous NO production by iNOS in microglia causes autocrine- and paracrine-induction of HO-1 protein in microgliaand astrocytes in rat brain.4.

The food intakeof male, 6-week-old Fischer 344 rats was reduced to 60% of the intake of controlrats fed ad libitum. The body and heart weights of rats diet restricted for 4.5months were less than those of the ad libitum fed animals, while the heart weightto body weight ratios were higher. The norepinephrine (NE) content of hearts fromrestricted rats (1073 +/- 84 ng/g wet wt) was higher than controls (774 +/- 38ng/g wet wt), although the total amount of NE per heart was unchanged. Similarly,the cardiac synaptosomal P2 fraction from restricted rats possessed a higher NEcontent (24.1 +/- 2.4 ng/mg protein) than the P2 fraction of ad libitum fedcontrols (13.7 +/- 1.3 ng/mg protein). The desmethylimipramine-sensitivenorepinephrine uptake of the P2 fraction from restricted rats was significantlyhigher than that of control rats (9.44 +/- 1.33 vs 4.75 +/- 0.35 ng/mgprotein/hr). The NE uptakes of the two groups were similar when uptake wasnormalized to endogenous NE levels. These results demonstrate that long-termdietary restriction affects cardiac sympathetic nerve endings and suggest thatpart of the beneficial action of life-long dietary restriction on the age-relateddecline in cardiovascular regulation may be related to changes in cardiacsympathetic nerves.Int J Cancer. 1985 Apr 15;35(4):493-7.Muscarinic cholinergic receptors in pancreatic acinar carcinoma of rat.Taton G, Delhaye M, Swillens S, Morisset J, Larose L, Longnecker DS, Poirier GG.The active enantiomer of tritiated quinuclidinyl benzilate (3H(-)QNB) was used asa ligand to evaluate the muscarinic receptors. The 3H(-)QNB bindingcharacteristics of muscarinic cholinergic receptors obtained from normal andneoplastic tissues were studied to determine changes in receptor propertiesduring neoplastic transformation. Saturable and stereospecific binding sites for3H(-)QNB are present in homogenates of rat pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Theproportions of high- and low-affinity agonist binding sites are similar forneoplastic and normal tissues. The density of muscarinic receptors is higher inneoplastic (200 femtomoles/mg protein) than in normal pancreatic homogenates (80femtomoles/mg protein). The muscarinic binding sites of the neoplastic and fetalpancreas show similar KD values which are higher than those observed for normalpancreas.17: Cancer Res. 1986 Nov;46(11):5706-14.Muscarinic receptor coupling to intracellular calcium release in rat pancreaticacinar carcinoma.Chien JL, Warren JR.Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ofcholinergic receptor protein affinity labeled with the muscarinic antagonist[3H]propylbenzilylcholine mustard revealed a major polypeptide with molecularweight of 80,000-83,000 in both acinar carcinoma and normal acinar cells of ratpancreas. Muscarinic receptor protein is therefore conserved in pancreatic acinarcarcinoma. A small but significant difference was detected in the affinity ofcarcinoma cell receptors (Kd approximately 0.6 nM) and normal cell receptors (Kdapproximately 0.3 nM) for reversible binding of the muscarinic antagonist drug,N-methylscopolamine. In addition, carcinoma cell muscarinic receptors displayedhomogeneous binding of the agonist drugs carbamylcholine (Kd approximately 31microM) and oxotremorine (Kd approximately 4 microM), whereas normal cellreceptors demonstrated heterogeneous binding, with a minor receptor populationshowing high affinity binding for carbamylcholine (Kd approximately 3 microM) andoxotremorine (Kd approximately 160 nM), and a major population showing lowaffinity binding for carbamylcholine (Kd approximately 110 microM) andoxotremorine (Kd approximately 18 microM). Both carcinoma and normal cellsexhibited concentration-dependent carbamylcholine-stimulated increases incytosolic free Ca2+, as measured by 45Ca2+ outflux assay and intracellular quin 2fluorescence. However, carcinoma cells were observed to be more sensitive to Ca2+mobilizing actions of submaximal carbamylcholine concentrations, demonstrating50% maximal stimulation of intracellular Ca2+ release at a carbamylcholineconcentration (approximately 0.4 microM) approximately one order of magnitudebelow that seen for normal cells. These results indicate altered muscarinicreceptor coupling to intracellular Ca2+ release in acinar carcinoma cells, whichmanifests as a single activated receptor state for agonist binding, and increasedsensitivity of Ca2+ release in response to muscarinic receptor stimulation.1: Anticancer Drugs. 2008 Aug;19(7):655-71.Neurotransmission and cancer: implications for prevention and therapy.Schuller HM.Experimental Oncology Laboratory, Department of Pathobiology, College ofVeterinary Medicine, University of Tennessee, 2407 River Drive, Knoxville, TN37996, USA.hmsch@utk.eduPublished evidence compiled in this review supports the hypothesis that thedevelopment, progression, and responsiveness to prevention and therapy of themost common human cancers is strongly influenced, if not entirely orchestrated,by an imbalance in stimulatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Theneurotransmitters acetylcholine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline of the autonomicnervous system act as powerful upstream regulators that orchestrate numerous celland tissue functions, by releasing growth factors, angiogenesis factors andmetastasis factors, arachidonic acid, proinflammatory cytokines, and localneurotransmitters from cancer cells and their microenvironment. In addition, theymodulate proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis of cancerdirectly by intracellular signaling downstream of neurotransmitter receptors.Nicotine and the tobacco-specific nitrosamines have the documented ability tohyperstimulate neurotransmission by both branches of the autonomic nervoussystem. The expression and function of these neurotransmitter pathways are celltype specific. Lifestyle, diet, diseases, stress, and pharmacological treatmentsmodulate the expression and responsiveness of neurotransmitter pathways. Currentpreclinical testing systems fail to incorporate the modulating effects ofneurotransmission on the responsiveness to anticancer agents and should beamended accordingly. The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid has a stronginhibitory function on sympathicus-driven cancers whereas stimulators of cyclicadenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A signaling have strong inhibitoryfunction on parasympathicus-driven cancers. Marker-guided restoration of thephysiological balance in stimulatory and inhibitory neurotransmission representsa promising and hitherto neglected strategy for the prevention and therapy ofneurotransmitter-responsive cancers.Psychological stress in IBD: new insights into pathogenic and ...www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov› Journal List › Gut › v.54(10); Oct 2005by JE Mawdsley - ‎2005 - ‎Cited by 255 - ‎Related articlesPsychological stress has long been reported anecdotally to increase disease ..... atropine and was more marked in cholinesterase deficient Wistar-Kyoto rats.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2002 May;26(5):672-81.Sexual diergism of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal cortical responses to low-dosephysotigmine in elderly vs. young women and men.Rubin RT, Rhodes ME, O'Toole S, Czambel RK.Center for Neurosciences Research, MCP Hahnemann University School of Medicine,Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA 15212, USA.rubin@wpahs.orgWe previously demonstrated that the reversible cholinesterase inhibitor,physostigmine (PHYSO), administered to normal young adult women and men (averageage 35 years) at a dose that produced few or no side effects, resulted in a sexdifference (sexual diergism) in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal cortical (HPA)axis responses: PlasmaACTH(1-39), cortisol, and arginine vasopressin (AVP)concentrations increased to a significantly greater extent in the men than inthe women.To explore the effect of age on these sexually diergic hormoneresponses, in the present study we used the same dose of PHYSO (8 microg/kg IV)to stimulate ACTH(1-39), cortisol, and AVP secretion in normal elderly,non-estrogen-replaced women and elderly men (average ages 73 years and 70 years,respectively). The subjects underwent three test sessions 5-7 days apart: PHYSO,saline control, and a second session of PHYSO. Serial blood samples were takenfor hormone analyses before and after pharmacologic challenge.As with thepreviously studied younger subjects, PHYSO administration produced no sideeffects in about half the elderly subjects and mild side effects in the otherhalf, with no significant female-male differences.The hormone responses were2-5 fold greater in the elderly subjects than in the younger subjects, but incontrast to the younger subjects, the elderly men did not have significantlygreater hormone responses to PHYSO administration than did the elderly women.The ACTH(1-39) and AVP responses to PHYSO for the two sessions weresignificantly positively correlated in the men (+0.96, +0.91) but not in thewomen. None of the hormone responses was significantly correlated with thepresence or absence of side effects in either group of subjects.These resultsindicatea greater sensitivity of the HPA axis to low-dose PHYSO, and a loss ofoverall sex differences in hormone responses, in elderly compared with youngersubjects.The lack of a difference in side effects between the elderly women andmen and the lack of significant correlations between presence or absence of sideeffects and hormone responses suggest that the increase in hormone responseswith aging is due to correspondingly increased responsiveness of centralcholinergic systems and/or the HPA axis, and not to a nonspecific stressresponse.Horm Behav. 2013 Feb;63(2):284-90.Progesterone and neuroprotection.Singh M, Su C.Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, Institute for Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Research, Center FOR HER, University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth, Fort Worth, TX 76107, USA.meharvan.singh@unthsc.eduNumerous studies aimed at identifying the role of estrogen on the brain have used the ovariectomized rodent as the experimental model. And while estrogen intervention in these animals has, at least partially, restored cholinergic, neurotrophin and cognitive deficits seen in the ovariectomized animal, it is worth considering that the removal of the ovaries results in the loss of not only circulating estrogen but of circulating progesterone as well. As such, the various deficits associated with ovariectomy may be attributed to the loss of progesterone as well. Similarly, one must also consider the fact that the human menopause results in the precipitous decline of not just circulating estrogens, but in circulating progesterone as well and as such, the increased risk for diseases such as Alzheimer's disease during the postmenopausal period could also be contributed by this loss of progesterone. In fact, progesterone has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects, both in cell models, animal models and in humans.Here, we review the evidence that supports the neuroprotective effects of progesterone and discuss the various mechanisms that are thought to mediate these protective effects.We also discuss the receptor pharmacology of progesterone's neuroprotective effects and present a conceptual model of progesterone action that supports the complementary effects of membrane-associated and classical intracellular progesterone receptors.In addition, we discuss fundamental differences in the neurobiology of progesterone and the clinically used, synthetic progestin, medroxyprogesterone acetate that may offer an explanation for the negative findings of the combined estrogen/progestin arm of the Women's Health Initiative-Memory Study (WHIMS) and suggest that the type of progestin used may dictate the outcome of either pre-clinical or clinical studies that addresses brain function.Brain Res. 2005 Jul 5;1049(1):112-9.Progesterone treatment inhibits the inflammatory agents that accompany traumatic brain injury.Pettus EH, Wright DW, Stein DG, Hoffman SW.Department of Cell Biology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.Progesterone given after traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been shown to reducethe initial cytotoxic surge of inflammatory factors. We used Western blottechniques to analyze how progesterone might affect three inflammation-relatedfactors common to TBI: complement factor C3 (C3), glial fibrillary acidicprotein (GFAP), and nuclear factor kappa beta (NFkappaB). One hour afterbilateral injury to the medial frontal cortex, adult male rats were giveninjections of progesterone (16 mg/kg) for 2 days. Brains were harvested 48 hpost-TBI, proteins were extracted from samples, each of which contained tissuefrom both the contused and peri-contused areas, then measured by Western blotdensitometry. Complete C3, GFAP, and NFkappaB p65 were increased in all injuredanimals. However, in animals given progesterone post-TBI,NFkappaB p65 and theinflammatory metabolites of C3 (9 kDa and 75 kDa)were decreased in comparisonto vehicle-treated animals.J Leukoc Biol 1996 Mar;59(3):442-50Progesterone inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase geneexpression and nitric oxide production in murinemacrophages.Miller L, Alley EW, Murphy WJ, Russell SW, Hunt JSDepartment of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, USA.The purpose of this study was to determine whether the female hormones estradiol-l7 beta (E2) and progesterone (P4) influence inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the production of nitric oxide (NO) by interferon-gamma(IFN-gamma)-and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated mouse macrophages. Treatment with P4 alone caused a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of NO production by macrophage cell lines (RAW 264.7, J774) and mouse bone marrow culture-derived macrophages as assessed by nitrite accumulation. RAW 264.7 cells transiently transfected with an iNOS gene promoter/luciferase reporter-gene construct that were stimulated with IFN-gamma/LPS in the presence of P4 displayed reduced luciferase activity and NO production. Analysis of RAW 264.7 cells by Northern blot hybridization revealed concurrent P4-mediated reduction in iNOS mRNA. These observations suggest that P4-mediated inhibition of NO may be an important gender-based difference within females and males that relates to macrophage-mediated host defense.J Reprod Immunol 1997 Nov 15;35(2):87-99Female steroid hormones regulate production ofpro-inflammatory molecules in uterine leukocytes.Hunt JS, Miller L, Roby KF, Huang J, Platt JS, DeBrot BLDepartment of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City 66160-7400, USA.jhunt@kumc.eduEstrogens and progesterone could be among the environmental signals that govern uterine immune cell synthesis of pro-inflammatory substances. In order to investigate this possibility, we first mapped expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) genes in the leukocytes of cycling and pregnant mouse uteri, then tested the ability of estradiol-17 beta (E2) and progesterone to influence gene expression. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and other experimental approaches, revealed that the iNOS and TNF-alpha genes are expressed in mouse uterine mast cells, macrophages and natural killer cells (uNK). Gene expression in each cell type was noted to be dependent upon stage of the cycle or stage of gestation, implying potential relationships with levels of female hormones and state of cell differentiation or activation. Further in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that individual hormones have cell type-specific effects on synthesis of iNOS and TNF-alpha that are exerted at the level of transcription. In uterine mast cells, iNOS and TNF-alpha are promoted by E2 whereas preliminary studies in macrophages suggest that transcription and translationof the two genes are unaffected by E2 but are inhibited by progesterone.Hypothyroidism increases NO; T3, vs helpless; hypothyroid, escape deficit, Levine, et 1990.choline is increased in AD CSF Elble R;, Carriere;Genes Nutr. 2009 December; 4(4): 309–314.Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids improve cholinergic transmission in the aged brainWillis LM, Shukitt-Hale B, Joseph JA.28.

[PubMed]The protective effect of anticholinergic drugs, such as atropine or scopolamine, against various degenerative brain processes might lead a person to wonder whether the Berkeley enrichment experiments might not have been neurologically exactly the opposite of the stress experiments of Richter and Seligman, that is, reducing cholinergic processes with enrichment, increasing them with impoverishment of choices and experience.  A drug, pilocarpine,USING THE BRAIN FOR LIFELiving is development; the choices we make create our individuality. If genetically identical mice grow up in a large and varied environment, small differences in their experience will affect cell growth in their brains, leading to large differences in their exploratory behavior as they age (Freund, et al., 2013). Geneticists used to say that \"genes determine our limits,\" but this experiment shows that an environment can provide both limitations and opportunities for expanding the inherited potential. If our environment restricts our choices, our becoming human is thwarted, the way rats' potentials weren't discovered when they were kept in the standard little laboratory boxes. An opportunity to be complexly involved in a complex environment lets us become more of what we are, more humanly differentiated.A series of experiments that started at the University of California in 1960 found that rats that lived in larger spaces with various things to explore were better at learning and solving problems than rats that were raised in the standard little laboratory cages (Rosenzweig, 1960). Studying their brains, they found that the enzyme cholinesterase, which destroys the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, was increased. They later found that the offspring of these rats were better learners than their parents, and their brains contained more cholinesterase. Their brains were also larger, with a considerable thickening of the cortex, which is considered to be the part mainly responsible for complex behavior, learning and intelligence.These processes aren't limited to childhood. For example, London taxi drivers who learn all the streets in the city develop a larger hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with memory.The 1960s research into environmental enrichment coincided with political changes in the US, but it went against the dominant scientific ideas of the time. Starting in 1945, the US government had begun a series of projects to develop techniques of behavior modification or mind control, using drugs, isolation, deprivation, and torture. In the 1950s, psychiatry often used lobotomies (about 80,000, before they were generally discontinued in the 1980s) and electroconvulsive \"therapy,\" and university psychologists tortured animals, often as part of developing techniques for controlling behavior.The CIA officially phased out their MKultra program in 1967, but that was the year that Martin Seligman, at the University of Pennsylvania, popularized the idea of \"learned helplessness.\" He found that when an animal was unable to escape from torture, even for a very short time, it would often fail to even try to escape the next time it was tortured.Seligman's lectures have been attended by psychologists who worked at Guantanamo, and he recently received a no-bid Pentagon grant of $31,000,000, to develop a program of \"comprehensive soldier fitness,\" to train marines to avoid learned helplessness.Curt Richter already in 1957 had described the \"hopelessness\" phenomenon in rats (“a reaction of hopelessness is shown by some wild rats very soon after being grasped in the hand and prevented from moving. They seem literally to give up,”) and even how to cure their hopelessness, by allowing them to have an experience of escaping once (Richter, 1957).  Rats which would normally be able to keep swimming in a tank for two or three days, would often give up and drown in just a few minutes, after having an experience of \"inescapable stress.\" Richter made the important discovery that the hearts of the hopeless rats slowed down before they died, remaining relaxed and filled with blood, revealing the dominant activity of the vagal nerve, secreting acetylcholine.The sympathetic nervous system (secreting noradrenaline) accelerates the heart, and is usually activated in stress, in the \"fight or flight\" reaction, but this radically different (parasympathetic) nervous activity hadn't previously been seen to occur in stressful situations. The parasympathetic, cholinergic, nervous system had been thought of as inactive during stress, and activated to regulate processes of digestion, sleep, and repair. Besides the cholinergic nerves of the parasympathetic system, many nerves of the central nervous system also secrete acetylcholine, which activates smooth muscles, skeletal muscles, glands, and other nerves, and also has some inhibitory effects. The parasympathetic nerves also secrete the enzyme, cholinesterase, which destroys acetylcholine. However, many other types of cell (red blood cells, fibroblasts, sympathetic nerves, marrow cells), maybe all cells, can secrete acetylcholine.Because cholinergic nerves have been opposed to the sympathetic, adrenergic, nerves, there has been a tendency to neglect their nerve exciting roles, when looking at causes of excitotoxicity, or the stress-induced loss of brain cells. Excessive cholinergic stimulation, however, can contribute to excitotoxic cell death, for example when it's combined with high cortisol and/or hypoglycemia.Drugs that block the stimulating effects of acetylcholine (the anticholinergics) as well as chemicals that mimic them, such as the organophosphate insecticides, can impair the ability to think and learn. This suggested to some people that age-related dementia was the result of the deterioration of the cholinergic nerves in the brain. Drugs to increase the stimulating effects of acetylcholine in the brain (by inactivating cholinesterase) were promoted as treatment for Alzheimer's disease.Although herbal inhibitors were well known, profitable new drugs, starting with Tacrine, were put into use. It was soon evident that Tacrine was causing serious liver damage, but wasn't slowing the rate of mental deterioration.As the failure of the cholinergic drug Tacrine was becoming commonly known, another drug, amantadine (later, the similar memantine) was proposed for combined treatment. In the 1950s, the anticholinergic drug atropine was proposed a few times for treating dementia,and amantadine, which was also considered anticholinergic, was proposed for some mental conditions, including Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (Sanders and Dunn, 1973). It must have seemed odd to propose that an anticholinergic drug be used to treat a condition that was being so profitably treated with a pro-cholinergic drug, but memantine came to be classified as an anti-excitatory \"NMDA blocker,\" to protect the remaining cholinergic nerves, so that both drugs could be prescribed simultaneously. The added drug seems to have a small beneficial effect, but there has been no suggestion that this could be the result of its previously-known anticholinergic effects.Over the years, some people have suspected that Alzheimer's disease might be caused partly by a lack of purpose and stimulation in their life, and have found that meaningful, interesting activity could improve their mental functioning. Because the idea of a \"genetically determined hard-wired\" brain is no longer taught so dogmatically, there is increasing interest in this therapy for all kinds of brain impairment. The analogy to the Berkeley enrichment experience is clear, so the association of increasing cholinesterase activity with improving brain function should be of interest.The after-effect of poisoning by nerve gas or insecticide has been compared to the dementia of old age. The anticholinergic drugs are generally recognized for protecting against those toxins. Traumatic brain injury, even with improvement in the short term, often starts a long-term degenerative process, greatly increasing the likelihood of dementia at a later age. A cholinergic excitotoxic process is known to be involved in the traumatic degeneration of nerves (Lyeth and Hayes, 1992), and the use of anticholinergic drugs has been recommended for many years to treat traumatic brain injuries (e.g., Ward, 1950: Ruge, 1954; Hayes, et al., 1986).In 1976 there was an experiment (Rosellini, et al.) that made an important link between the enrichment experiments and the learned helplessness experiments. The control animals in the enrichment experiments were singly housed, while the others shared a larger enclosure. In the later experiment, it was found that the rats \"who were reared in isolation died suddenly when placed in a stressful swimming situation,\" while the group-housed animals were resistant, effective swimmers. Enrichment and deprivation have very clear biological meaning, and one is the negation of the other.The increase of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that destroys acetylcholine, during enrichment, serves to inactivate cholinergic processes. If deprivation does its harm by increasing the activity of the cholinergic system, we should expect that a cholinergic drug might substitute for inescapable stress, as a cause of learned helplessness, and that an anticholinergic drug could cure learned helplessness. Those tests have been done: \"Treatment with the anticholinesterase, physostigmine, successfully mimicked the effects ofinescapable shock.\" \"The centrally acting anticholinergic scopolamine hydrobromide antagonized the effects of physostigmine, and when administered prior to escape testing antagonized the disruptive effects of previously administered inescapable shock.\" (Anisman, et al., 1981.)This kind of experiment would suggest that the anticholinesterase drugs still being used for Alzheimer's disease treatment aren't biologically helpful. In an earlier newsletter I discussed the changes of growth hormone, and its antagonist somatostatin, in association with dementia: Growth hormone increases, somatostatin decreases. The cholinergic nerves are a major factor in shifting those hormones in the direction of dementia, and the anticholinergic drugs tend to increase the ratio of somatostatin to growth hormone. Somatostatin and cholinesterase have been found to co-exist in single nerve cells (Delfs, et al., 1984).Estrogen, which was promoted so intensively as prevention or treatment for Alzheimer's disease, was finally shown to contribute to its development. One of the characteristic effects of estrogen is to increase the level of growth hormone in the blood. This is just one of many ways that estrogen is associated with cholinergic activation. During pregnancy, it's important for the uterus not to contract. Cholinergic stimulation causes it to contract; too much estrogen activates that system, and causes miscarriage if it's excessive. An important function of progesterone is to keep the uterus relaxed during pregnancy. In the uterus, and in many other systems, progesterone increases the activity of cholinesterase, removing the acetylcholine which, under the influence of estrogen, would cause the uterus to contract.Progesterone is being used to treat brain injuries, very successfully. It protects against inflammation, and in an early study, compared to placebo, lowered mortality by more than half. It's instructive to consider its anticholinergic role in the uterus, in relation to its brain protective effects. When the brain is poisoned by an organophosphate insecticide, which lowers the activity of cholinesterase, seizures are likely to occur, and treatment with progesterone can prevent those seizures, reversing the inhibition of the enzyme (and increasing the activity of cholinesterase in rats that weren't poisoned) (Joshi, et al., 2010). Similar effects of progesterone on cholinesterase occur in women (Fairbrother, et al., 1989), implying that this is a general function of progesterone, not just something to protect pregnancy. Estrogen, with similar generality, decreases the activity of cholinesterase. DHEA, like progesterone, increases the activity of cholinesterase, and is brain protective (Aly, et al., 2011).Brain trauma consistently leads to decreased activity of this enzyme (Östberg, et al., 2011; Donat, et al., 2007), causing the acetylcholine produced in the brain to accumulate, with many interesting consequences. In 1997, a group (Pike, et al.) created brain injuries in rats to test the idea that a cholinesterase inhibitor would improve their recovery and ability to move through a maze. They found instead that it reduced the cognitive ability of both the injured and normal rats. An anticholinergic drug, selegeline (deprenyl) that is used to treat Parkinson's disease and, informally, as a mood altering antiaging drug, was found by a different group (Zhu, et al., 2000) to improve cognitive recovery from brain injuries.One of acetylcholine's important functions, in the brain as elsewhere, is the relaxation of blood vessels, and this is done by activating the synthesis of NO, nitric oxide. (Without NO, acetylcholine constricts blood vessels; Librizzi, et al., 2000.) The basic control of blood flow in the brain is the result of the relaxation of the wall of blood vessels in the presence of carbon dioxide, which is produced in proportion to the rate at which oxygen and glucose are being metabolically combined by active cells. In the inability of cells to produce CO2 at a normal rate, nitric oxide synthesis in blood vessels can cause them to dilate. The mechanism of relaxation by NO is very different, however, involving the inhibition of mitochondrial energy production (Barron, et al., 2001). Situations that favor the production and retention of a larger amount of carbon dioxide in the tissues are likely to reduce the basic \"tone\" of the parasympathetic nervous system, as there is less need for additional vasodilation.Nitric oxide can diffuse away from the blood vessels, affecting the energy metabolism of nerve cells (Steinert, et al., 2010). Normally, astrocytes protect nerve cells from nitric oxide (Chen, et al., 2001), but that function can be altered, for example by bacterial endotoxin absorbed from the intestine (Solà, et al., 2002) or by amyloid-beta (Tran, 2001), causing them to produce nitric oxide themselves.Nitric oxide is increasingly seen as an important factor in nerve degeneration (Doherty, 2011). Nitric oxide activates processes (Obukuro, et al., 2013) that can lead to cell death. Inhibiting the production of nitric oxide protects against various kinds of dementia (Sharma & Sharma, 2013; Sharma & Singh, 2013). Brain trauma causes a large increase in nitric oxide formation, and blocking its synthesis improves recovery (Hüttemann, et al., 2008; Gahm, et al., 2006). Organophosphates increase nitric oxide formation, and the protective anticholinergic drugs such as atropine reduce it (Chang, et al., 2001; Kim, et al., 1997). Stress, including fear (Campos, et al., 2013) and isolation (ZlatkoviÄ and FilipoviÄ, 2013) can activate the formation of nitric oxide, and various mediators of inflammation also activate it. The nitric oxide in a person's exhaled breath can be used to diagnose some diseases, and it probably also reflects the level of their emotional well-being.The increase of cholinesterase by enriched living serves to protect tissues against an accumulation of acetylcholine. The activation of nitric oxide synthesis by acetylcholine tends to block energy production, and to activate autolytic or catabolic processes, which are probably involved in the development of a thinner cerebral cortex in isolated or stressed animals. Breaking down acetylcholine rapidly, the tissue renewal processes are able to predominate in the enriched animals.Environmental conditions that are favorable for respiratory energy production are protective against learned helplessness and neurodegeneration, and other biological problems that involve the same mechanisms. Adaptation to high altitude, which stimulates the formation of new mitochondria and increased thyroid (T3) activity, has been used for many years to treat neurological problems, and the effect has been demonstrated in animal experiments (Manukhina, et al., 2010). Bright light can reverse the cholinergic effects of inescapable stress (Flemmer, et al., 1990).During the development of learned helplessness, the T3 level in the blood decreases (Helmreich, et al., 2006), and removal of the thyroid gland creates the \"escape deficit,\" while supplementing with thyroid hormone before exposing the animal inescapable shock prevents its development (Levine, et al., 1990). After learned helplessness has been created in rats, supplementing with T3 reverses it (Massol, et al., 1987, 1988).Hypothyroidism and excess cholinergic tone have many similarities, including increased formation of nitric oxide, so that similar symptoms, such as muscle inflammation, can be produced by cholinesterase inhibitors such as Tacrine, by increased nitric oxide, or by simple hypothyroidism (Jeyarasasingam, et al., 2000; Franco, et al., 2006).Insecticide exposure has been suspected to be a factor in the increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease (Zaganas, et al., 2013), but it could be contributing to many other problems, involving inflammation, edema, and degeneration. Another important source of organophosphate poisoning is the air used to pressurize airliners, which can be contaminated with organophosphate fumes coming from the engine used to compress it.Possibly the most toxic component of our environment is the way the society has been designed, to eliminate meaningful choices for most people. In the experiment of Freund,et al., some mice became more exploratory because of the choices they made, while others' lives became more routinized and limited. Our culture reinforces routinized living. In the absence of opportunities to vary the way you work and live to accord with new knowledge that you gain, the nutritional, hormonal and physical factors have special importance.Supplements of thyroid and progesterone are proven to be generally protective against the cholinergic threats, but there are many other factors that can be adjusted according to particular needs. Niacinamide, like progesterone, inhibits the production of nitric oxide, and also like progesterone, it improves recovery from brain injury (Hoane, et al., 2008). In genetically altered mice with an Alzheimer's trait, niacinamide corrects the defect (Green, et al., 2008). Drugs such as atropine and antihistamines can be used in crisis situations. Bright light, without excess ultraviolet, should be available every day.The cholinergic system is much more than a part of the nervous system, and is involved in cell metabolism and tissue renewal. Most people can benefit from reducing intake of phosphate, iron, and polyunsaturated fats (which can inhibit cholinesterase; Willis, et al., 2009), and from choosing foods that reduce production and absorption of endotoxin. And, obviously, drugs that are intended to increase the effects of nitric oxide and acetylcholine should be avoided.© Ray Peat Ph.D. 2016.

But when people die while they are receiving standard, but irrational and antiscientific treatments and “support,” the deaths aren’t counted as accidents. The numbers are large.Medical training and medical textbooks bear great responsibility for those unnecessary deaths. Most medical research is done under the influence of mistaken assumptions, and so fails to correct the myths of medical training. If the “consumers” or victims of medicine are willing to demand concrete justifications before accepting “standard procedures,” they will create an atmosphere in which medical mythology will be a little harder to sustain.======================================A sentence taken out of context is likely to be misleading. A chemical equation that is concerned only with the reactants, catalyst, and product, can be misleading, and its industrial application is likely to produce devastation and pollution along with the intended product. In nature and industry, the reactants, products, and energy changes are linked to the ecology and to the economy. In physiological chemistry, events in the organism are linked to the environment so closely that food, water, air, soil, and pollution form a firmly linked functional system.But “medical physiology” has evolved as a separate thing, in which formulas that describe specific situations are linked to each other by fragmentary schemes, terminology, and computer models. This jerrybuilt scheme is even more roughly set into a hypothetical environment of “the origin of life,” “evolution,” “inheritance,” “society,” and a few other perfunctory contextualizations that have no more relevance to the subject than do the literary epigraphs that are often used at the beginning of chapters in medical books, to signify that the author isn’t just a technical hack.This physiological mythology has made possible a practice of medicine in which “genes” and “a virus” are regularly invoked to explain things that can’t be remedied, and in which any fleshy body is described as “well nourished,” and in which malnutrition and poisoning by pollutants are systematically dismissed as explanations for sicknesses, while thousands of different drugs are administered according to instructions given by their salesmen. It is also deeply linked to attitudes that have turned the practice of medicine into the surest way for an individual to get rich and retire early. It creates a sense of confidence that the physician is doing the right thing, because there is a little physiological rationale for everything.When a practice is replaced by its opposite, there is also a rationale for that.In fact, medical textbooks are written to rationalize the highly arbitrary practices of the industry. If, for some reason, perpetual motion machines had been as successful economically as steam engines were, laws of thermodynamics would have been written to describe them, just as thermodynamic laws were invented to describe the theory of steam engines.It was odd and interesting when a vice presidential candidate stepped to the podium several years ago and asked “who am I? What am I doing here?” But those questions are really of the greatest importance and interest, and physiology should be an attempt to understand more fully what we are, what we are doing, and how we are doing it. When we have comprehensive answers to those questions, then we will be in a position to create systematically valid solutions for our problems.For physiology, the equivalent of medicine’s “first do no harm” would be “first, don’t believe unfounded doctrines.” Accepting that principle puts a person into a critical attitude, and experiments can become actually “empirical,” an extension of experience that allows you to perceive new things, rather than “testing hypotheses.” Unless a hypothesis is a generalization from real experience, rather than a deduction from a doctrine, progress is likely to be very slow. A first step in developing a critical attitude is to identify the idols that stand in the way of real understanding.Immunity, intelligence, appetites, tumor growth, aging, the proper development of organs—everything that we think of as the biological foundations of health and sickness—will be misinterpreted if there are fundamental misconceptions about physiology.Physiology is the study of the vital functions of organisms, but especially when talking about “pathologic physiology,” great emphasis in physiology textbooks is given to the processes that maintain homeostasis of themilieu interieur,or the constancy of composition of the “fluid in which tissue cells are bathed.” Since cells are embedded in a gel-like matrix, “connective tissue,” the connective tissue should have some serious attention in physiology courses, but in practice its composition is described, and then the rest of physiology treats it as the “extracellular space.” Only specialists in the extracellular matrix are likely to take it seriously as a factor in physiology.If medical physiologists are likely to think of cells as being “bathed in fluid” which fills the empty spaces around the cells, they are also likely to think of the cell’s interior as a watery solution which “fills the space enclosed by the cell membrane.” It is this image of the organism that has made traditional biochemistry possible, since enzymes extracted from cells and dissolved in water had been thought to function the way they function in the living state. But the living cell isn’t like a tiny water-filled test-tube.Some of the points that should be considered in a realistic (and therefore coherent) physiology text:Connective tissues, ground substance— making a multicell organism--secreting the right amount, modifying/maintaining it, responding to the scaffolding--where the crucialmilieu interieuris.Cellular energy, a structural idea—a finely organized catalyst, a readiness for work, and conditions that determine the equilibrium of reactions.The dimensions of the organismrange from cellular fields to organismic intentions, via functional systems.Physiology should be understood in terms of its geochemical setting,because otherwise basic definitions will be built up in the belief that life is discontinuous from its physical environment, separated by membranes, and maintained by the expense of energy mainly to preserve gradients across those membranes;while in actuality the chemical energy released by living substance is spent in renewing structures, and the gradients are mainly passive physical-chemical consequences of structure. The spontaneous polymerization that occurs under volcanic conditions creates substances with intrinsic functions. The living state is a substance that is always being renewed as it interacts with its environment, and from the larger persepective, it is an evolving catalyst that modifies the environment so that the whole system approaches equilibrium with the energy that flows through it. Since the evolving system stores energy in its structure, the cosmic energy sources and sinks are at the boundaries of the system, and are the only questions that (so far) transcend the issue of life in its environment. The chemistry of the planet is tied up with cosmic energy, but the nature of the system as a whole is still relatively unexplored.

Guyton, of Ole Miss, wrote a textbook of medical physiology, and one of his students, J. E. Hall, has added chapters to it. It is the most widely used physiology textbook in the world. It may be more influential than the bible, since it has shaped the behavior of millions of doctors, affecting billions of people. Its success probably has something to do with Guyton’s unusual personal experience. After graduating from Harvard Medical School and, along with others from Harvard, working in germ warfare,* he contracted polio, and returned to Mississippi. As someone moving from the centers of excellence and power to the most backward state in the nation, instead of using textbooks he wrote handouts for the classes he taught there, devising what he thought were plausible explanations for everything in physiology. A personalized perspective and desire to keep things simple made the book, based on those handouts, readable and popular.The circulatory system, and the movement of fluids in the body, are at the center of physiology, so it is of interest that Guyton believed that, in the “spaces around cells,” there is a negative pressure, a partial vacuum, that sucks fluid out of the capillaries. He believed that this suction would balance a column of 5 or 10 mm of mercury. The rib cage, and the force of the diaphragm muscle, can maintain a negative pressure around the lungs, preventing their elastic collapse, but there is no such shell around the rest of the body; if elastic fibers of connective tissue could be anchored to such a shell, then such a suction/vacuum would be conceivable.Hydrostatic and osmotic pressures interact in tissues, but even the hydrostatic forces produced by the heartbeat are known only approximately, as estimates, on the microscopic level. The belief in subatmospheric interstitial pressure is unreasonable on its face, and measurements are so inaccurate in the microcirculation that its disproof would be somewhat like proving that fairies aren’t responsible for the Brownian motions seen under a microscope.The oncotic/osmotic behavior of proteins in the blood and extracellular (the terminterstitialimplies the presence of empty spaces which aren’t really there) fluid is usually, in medical physiology, assumed to be a fixed quantity determined by the nature of the polymer. Swelling and syneresis (contraction) of gels, with the absorption or release of water, are strongly influenced by the electrical properties of the system, which includes solvent water, bound water, and small solutes and ions as well as the polymers. Changes in pH and ionic strength and temperature, and the presence of solutes modifying the polymer’s affinity for water, affect the osmotic behavior of the polymer, and of gels formed by such polymers. Since the extracellular spaces are mainly filled with solid gels, Guyton’s image of simple fluids entering and leaving these “spaces” reveals a major conceptual error, and that error has been widely propagated by medical professors. If a person imagines open spaces, interstices, between cells, then the question of the fluid pressure in these chambers seems reasonable, and the factors that produce edema will be thought of mechanically. But if we call the material between cells the “extracellular matrix,” and recognize its relatively solid gel nature, we will see the problem of edema in physical-chemical terms, rather than as a problem of simple hydraulics.[*Biographical side-lights:Guyton graduated from Ole Miss in 1939, got his medical degree from Harvard in 1943, where the department of bacteriology had a grant to study the polio virus, and where he worked with people “involved in the war effort,” and then from 1944 to 1946 was involved in germ warfare research, mainly at Camp Detrick. Camp Detrick had been established as the center for chemical and biological warfare research, and a test site was established in Mississippi in 1943. Guyton’s first paper was on aerosol research (published in 1946), and studies at that time were being done to improve the spreading of germs in aerosols. Bacterial aerosols were tested on the public in San Francisco, in 1950. Guyton’s Harvard colleagues established a polio research lab at Children’s Hospital Medical Center. When he left the navy, after working at Camp Detrick, Guyton resumed work at Mass General, and contracted polio before he finished his residency.]Idols of medical physiology, foundations and cornerstones for the landfill, some things you shouldn’t know about physiology:Genes control the cell, the organism is its genome, the nucleus regulates the cytoplasm. Information flowing from the genes produces and maintains the organism.Acquired traits aren’t passed on; mutations are random, the genome doesn’t acquire information from the organism or environment, the germ-line is isolated.Physiology is bounded by the informational function of genes.The cell is a drop of water containing dissolved chemicals enclosed in a membrane.Random diffusion governs energy metabolism, gene induction, and other intracellular events.Enzyme reactions occur when dissolved molecules randomly diffusing come into contact with a suitable enzyme, as described by the Michaelis-Menton equation.The Donnan equilibrium explains cellular electrical behavior, and since ions are distributed across the membrane by active transport, the membrane potential is maintained by the expense of metabolic energy.Water is just a peculiar solvent.Water structure changes only at extremes of temperature.Cells are perfect osmometers.There are empty spaces between cells.The membrane regulates the composition of the cytoplasm, with pumps and pores and channels. Cells must produce enough energy to keep the pumps running.Membrane receptors regulate cell responses.Cells are activated by receptors, and physical forces for which there are no receptors have no effect on cells except when they are above a threshold at which they cause discrete chemical changes.The nervous system is hard-wired.Brain and heart cells don’t regenerate.There is an immune system, whose function is to destroy pathogens, with inflammation as one of its functions, and its specific reactions are determined by the selection of clones which were generated by random mutations; an autonomic nervous system, which regulates visceral reflexes by innervating, via receptors, smooth muscle, heart muscle, and glands; an endocrine system, regulated mainly by negative feedback, that produces hormone molecules that carry messages to the receptors in certain target tissues.Inflammation is produced by germs, and is a defensive reaction of the immune system, and so is good. (Sterile inflammation is too confusing to include within the ambit of medical physiology, since it is associated with serious harm to the organism. The roles in inflammation of the nervous and endocrine systems and kidneys and membrane pumps and osmoregulation aren’t discussed in polite books.)During development, cells are organized into systems, and they don’t change their type. In the case of germ cells, their type is determined before they exist. Cells are able to undergo only about 50 divisions, and most of those divisions are used up in producing an adult organism.The committed nature of the organism’s cells and anatomy make radical functional adaptation impossible.Hormones and transmitter substances act only through specific receptor molecules.High energy phosphate bonds in compounds such as ATP provide energy to molecular pumps and motors.Molecular forces act only locally.Pathologies are primarily local: Inflammations and tumors have local causes, and their effects are local. Specific and local treatments are ideal. Circulation is treated as a plumbing problem, tumors as clones of defective cells.Consciousness is produced by nervous signals that transmit information, and can be compared with the handling of information by computers.Excitation and inhibition are functions of cell membranes.Artificial intelligence research into computational and nerve net systems is as much a part of research into the physiology of consciousness as computer modeling of feedback systems is a form of research into endocrine physiology and immunology.Estrogen, testosterone, thyroid, prolactin, serotonin, adrenalin, prostaglandins, etc., are carriers of information in an informational system.Cyclic functions and behaviors are governed by genes.The existence of hard-wired informational receptor systems and gene-induction systems is necessary because of the random diffusional nature of the other cellular processes and materials.Essentially, an organism consists of random inert matter given form and activity by the imposition of genetic information accumulated through random mutations.(There are really people who still believe those things.)A NOTE ON SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS:If scientific revolutions depended on \"the authorities,\" then the Copernican revolution would be dated from the Pope's apology. The fact that the major journals are controlled by antiscientific dimwits helps to define where science exists. Gilbert Ling's revolution in cell physiology has been moved along by the existence of the journal, Physiological Chemistry and Physics (and medical NMR).Michael Polanyi, inPersonal Knowledge,maybe even more than Thomas Kuhn did in his famous book (Structure of Scientific Revolutions), helped to solidify the belief that there is a real international monolithic \"community of science.\" Even though Polanyi, working \"in isolation\" in Hungary created his general and elegant adsorption isotherm, he didn't teach it to his own students, because of his belief in that community of science, which ridiculed his work because it wasn't based on their (false) assumptions about the electrical nature of matter.The linguistic and cultural isolation of Hungary and Russia from Europe has permitted them to evolve distinctive scientific cultures. C.C. Lindegren, in Cold War in Biology, showed that political forces in the U.S. and England suppressed anti-Mendelian ideas by identifying them as subversive, imposing the Central Dogma of genetics.  But even within an authoritarian national tradition, there are little communities of science, where the real development of thought can take place.Perceptions that are clear and useful are the real revolutions in science, and the rest of it has to do with social and financial commitments.Even in the short time since Kuhn wrote his book, the status of medicine has changed significantly, putting it right up with militarism and the energy industry as a source of political and economic power. The authoritarian monolith that has been known as the community of science has become increasingly (even in areas such as astronomy, where commercial interests aren't so crudely involved) a structure of cultural propaganda maintained by bullying and fraud. Since the \"normal science\" in these authoritarian settings is dedicated to evading the truth, it becomes almost a guide to where to look for the truth. It's sort of analogous to the \"mystery\" of why breast cancer mortality is lowest in the poorest part of the U.S., Appalachia, and highest in the richest regions: the medical industry goes where the money is, taking death with it. Science, like health, thrives on the neglect of the corrupt industry.I have always felt that the cybernetic definition of communication as the transfer of something that makes a difference should be applied to speech and writing. As a student and teacher, I saw that information which made a difference was the essence of intellectual excitement and growth. But making a difference is exactly what university administrators and journal editors don't want.© Ray Peat Ph.D. 2014. All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com^^^Top^^^ © Ray Peat Ph.D. 2014.

Blake=======================Kurt Goldstein: \"Life is a condition alternating between excitation, destructionand unbalance, and reorganization, equilibrium and rest.\"===========================Oncological pathologists, looking at slices of a tumor, believe they can guesswhen the cells have an evil intention. However, biologists studying living cells find thatcells can do only what they are allowed to do by their environment.===========================Cancer: Disorder and EnergyAccording to the World Health Organization, cancer is now the leading cause of death inthe world. Although many \"causes\" are known, and despite the \"War on Cancer,\"nothing practical has been done to reduce the incidence of cancer. Since Nixon startedthat war, the number of people dying annually in the US has increased faster than thepopulation. In ancient Rome and Egypt, cancer was rare; cancer has been identified inonly one Egyptian mummy. In the US and several other countries, between 2002 and2005 there was an unprecedented decline (7% in the US) in the incidence of breastcancer, when the medical use of estrogen decreased following the Women's HealthInitiative report showing that estrogen caused cancer, dementia, strokes and heartattacks. However, when the public was reassured about estrogen's safety, breastcancer incidence began increasing again each year.The cancer industry has been flexible and imaginative in ways of presenting \"agestandardized\" death rates to show that they are making progress against cancer, butthere are philosophical and scientific problems in \"oncology\" (i.e., the study or treatmentof lumps) that should be considered by anyone who plans to do business with thatprofession.In the 19th century (in Johannes Muller's lab), cancers, like other animal tissues, werefound to be made up of cells, and by 1858, all diseases were said to be caused bydisturbances in cells (Rudolph Virchow). The atomic and molecular theory of matter wasbecoming accepted at the time that animals were found to be made up of cells, and inboth cases the \"elementary particles\" seemed to have a special power to explain things.This idea of a cellular basis of disease gradually displaced the old idea that diseaseswere caused by an imbalance of the body fluids, or humors. In 1863, Virchowrecognized that inflammation, involving leukocytes, was a common feature of cancer,but that aspect of his work was neglected for a long time.Recent medical textbooks reveal no major change in the understanding of cancer sinceVirchow's time, except that \"genes\" (which weren't known during Virchow's life)gradually became the most important aspect of cells. The typical modern textbookdescribes the cellular disturbance of cancer as the result of an \"initiating\" mutation in agene, which gives it the potential to develop into a cancer, if it subsequently is exposedto a \"promoter,\" which causes it to multiply. In some versions of the theory, a promoter isa second mutation that causes proliferation, but in other versions the promotion iscaused by chemicals binding to receptors the way hormones do, to stimulateproliferation. Typically, textbooks (and reports of continuing research) describesubsequent changes in the genes that cause a cancer to progress from a simple excessof cells through stages of increasing malignancy: hyperplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma insitu, invasive cancer.One of the reasons that the medical understanding of cancer hasn't changedsignificantly since Virchow's time is that blaming misbehaving cells for causing a tumorfits into the older medical tradition, that has existed at least since the time ofHippocrates, 400 BC, which treated tumors either by cutting them out, or by burningthem off with caustics. Virchow's identification of misbehaving cells provided a clearmental image of exactly what the physician must try to destroy. And it's probably hard toget interested in something which could seriously limit your professional activities if itturned out to be true.The \"cellular basis of cancer\" was developed simultaneously with the germ theory ofdisease, and in the case of cancer, the deviant cells came to be considered an aliensubstance, \"not-self,\" analogous to infective germs. Paul Ehrlich's search for poisonsthat were specific for bacterial pathogens was quickly extended to the idea of findingpoisons that would distinguish between cancer cells and the patient's cells.Hippocrates' therapeutic approach to cancer may have survived for 2400 years, but theideas of his younger contemporary, Plato, about order and causation have probably hada greater effect on medicine. Plato believed that the world of experience is inferior andaccidental, and that there are timeless \"Forms\" that are the real substances. In theatomic theory of matter, eternal, unchanging atoms took the place of platonic forms, andthere are still molecular biologists who insist that life can only be explained in terms ofits constituent atoms (\"What else is there but atoms?\"). This philosophy of timelessforms was a deep commitment of people like Gregor Mendel and August Weismann,whose ideas dominated the thinking of early 20th century geneticists. Genes were theimmutable essence of organisms, and the cells, tissues, and organs that form theorganism are merely temporal and accidental. Weismann's \"germ plasm\" or germ linecontained the immortal genes, the rest of the body lacked them, and was essentiallymortal.For most of the 20th century, the official doctrine was that most of the cells of the adultbody became stationary once the body reached its adult size, and that aging consistedof the \"wearing out\" of those mortal cells. When a tumor, containing new cells, wouldappear and grow, these cells were called \"immortal,\" because they didn't follow the rulefor normal, stationary, mortal cells. Their \"immortality\" is often demonstrated by growingthem endlessly in culture dishes. Normal cells, if they can be made to survive in aculture dish, are likely to be \"transformed\" into cancer, demonstrated by their ability toreplicate in dishes.This is an important ideological point, that developed as biologists were experiencingthe extreme difficulty of getting cells to replicate, or even to survive, in culture dishes. Ithas only recently been realized that cells need more than nutritional and hormonalsignals to survive in culture; they require certain textural, structural, even rhythmicallyrepeating conditions that mimic their surroundings in the living body.Applied to cancer, the gene theory made it seem clear that the changes occurring intumor cells were irrevocable, and it has seemed self-evident to oncologists that the onlyhope the cancer patient has is for the physician to destroy every bit of the aliensubstance. The recurrence of a cancer that has been removed has been evidence tothem that fragments had remained, or that the cancer had distributed its seeds intoother parts of the body. This seems to be the necessary conclusion if cancer is \"caused\"by defective genes.New ideas of causality have grown up in science beside, or within, the science culturethat is committed to platonism, reductionism, and genetic determinism. A few biologists,including Ana Soto and Carlos Sonnenschein, are applying more realistic ideas ofcausality to ecological, developmental, and cancer research. They have said (Soto, etal., 2009) \"The ecological developmental biology (eco-devo) movement rejects thenotion that development is merely the unfolding of a genetic program.\" If events such ascancer aren't \"caused by genes,\" understanding the causes of cancer and theappropriate ways to treat it will require more holistic ways of looking at the tumor'srelation to the organism, and the organism's relation to the environment.It has been more than 40 years since experimenters demonstrated that cancer cellscould be caused to revert to normal, by changing their environment. Harry Rubin (2006)has observed that cells can accumulate hundreds of mutations, and still functionnormally in the organism, but when separated and grown in a culture dish theirdifferences become obvious. The surrounding cells in the body are causing thedefective cells to remain normal in appearance, function, and growth behavior, insteadof acting like cancer cells, and can also cause \"stem-like\" cells to differentiateappropriately.. He says \"Intimate contact between the interacting cells is required toinduce these changes.\" When stem cells enter a tumor, they don't find that regulatory,normalizing interaction with normal cells.Work like Rubin's shows that even \"myriad\" mutations don't necessarily cause cancer,and another line of research shows that things which don't cause mutations can causecancer--the \"non-mutagenic carcinogens.\" The presence of mutations is neithersufficient nor necessary for causing cancer, but tumors do eventually accumulateserious damage, which causes most of the tumor cells to die quickly. Biological stress,or excitotoxic energy deprivation, destabilizes the genome; genetic changes develop asa result of prolonged destructive influences. The \"non-genotoxic\" carcinogens firstcause inflammation, excitation, and energy impairment, leading to fibrosis, and atrophy.Cycles of cell injury, death, and repair cause chromosomes to deteriorate as the tissueloses its organization.When a cell is stimulated, it responds, and the response requires energy. The strongerand more continuous the stimulus, the more energy the cell needs to continueresponding. In some conditions, cells can desensitize themselves, to survive in thepresence of continuous stimulation or irritation, but otherwise they are killed when theydon't have enough energy to keep responding.When a nerve is stimulated and responds, a wave of negative electrical charge passesthrough it; the electrical field accompanies a structural change in the cytoplasm of thenerve; similar changes occur in other types of cell. Stimulation of a nerve with negative(cathodal) polarity causes swelling, stimulation with the opposite polarity causes theopposite behavior; when nerve cells are inhibited, they shrink (Tasaki and Byrne,1980; Tasaki, et al., 1988; Tasaki, 1999).Swelling, an increase of the water content of an area of tissue, is a general feature ofinflammation (Weiss, et al., 1951), whether it's in a lump caused by a bee sting, abruise, or hives, or a cancer. Besides the instantaneous uptake of water described byTasaki, there are increases that continue because of metabolic and chemical changes inthe irritated cell. Tasaki has used gels of synthetic polymers to demonstrate that anelectrical field can cause these changes, without the need for the \"chemical osmotic\"changes that are customarily assumed to account for the swelling changes caused bystress (Tasaki, 2002). When the pH of a protein gel becomes more alkaline, it swells.The electrical activation of a nerve causes a quick shift towards internal alkalinity(Endres, et al., 1986), followed by a sudden increase in lactic acid production. Althoughincreased lactic acid causes acidity of an irritated or inflamed region, the conversion ofpyruvic acid to lactic acid causes the interior of the stressed cell to become morealkaline, causing it to swell. This is the same process that causes the familiar swelling oftired muscles.If blood vessels swell, the delivery of oxygen may be restricted, and hypoxia causesmore intense swelling, because more lactic acid is produced, and less oxidized. Thisswelling pressure resembles an increase of osmolarity. For over 100 years, it has beencustomary to treat shock with \"isotonic\" fluids, which are in balance with welloxygenated tissues, with approximately 290 milliosmoles per liter, but this usuallycauses edema, swelling, and weight gain. Stressed tissues have been found to be inbalance with fluids of much higher osmolarity, for example 372 mOsm/L (Tranum-Jensen, et al., 1981), and sometimes much higher.Apart from its acidity, lactic acid acts as an excitatory signal. A very slight increaseabove the normal amount of lactic acid in the body fluids excites sensitive cells, and theamounts reached in inflamed tissues and in cancers will excite even stable cells such asmyelinated nerves (Uchida and Murao, 1975).Cancer cells show all the signs of being intensely stimulated, and this includes a highrate of oxygen consumption (deGroof, et al., 2009). The stimulation increases theenergy requirements beyond the ability of the mitochondria's capacity to meet them,leading to the production of lactate even when a normal amount of oxygen is present.Even when both glucose and oxygen are supplied (which they usually aren't), the tumorcells will consume amino acids as fuel, as well as using them as material for growth.Tumors have been called \"nitrogen traps\" or \"glutamine traps,\" but this has meaningbeyond the use of the nitrogen for growth; it is involved in the energetic inefficiency ofthis process, and the reorganizing effects this wasteful flow of energy has on the tissuestructure (Medina, 2001). When glutamine enters the Krebs cycle to be used as fuel,this interferes with the ability to oxidize glucose, causing more lactic acid to be formed,contributing to the excitation and increased energy requirement.Lactic acid activates the other major mediators of inflammation, including prostaglandins(made from PUFA), free fatty acids (including arachidonate, that formsprostaglandins; Schoonderwoerd, et al., 1989), nitric oxide, carbon monoxide,proteolytic enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix, TNF (Jensen, et al., 1990),hypoxia inducible factor (Lu, et al., 2002; McFate, et al., 2008), interferon, andinterleukins. Arachidonic acid itself can increase lactate production (Meroni, et al.,2003). TNFalpha and interferon gamma activate lactic acid production by increasingprostaglandins (Taylor, et al., 1992).Most of the present information about cancer cells' behavior, such as reactions toradiation and chemical toxins, has been based on the study of cells in culture dishes.For more than 70 years, it was generally believed that radiation caused mutations andcancer by directly modifying the cells' genetic material. Then, it was discovered thatfresh cells that were added to a dish of irradiated cells also developed mutations. Theradiation causes cells to emit excitatory, inflammatory, substances such as serotoninand nitric oxide, which injure the cells that are later put near them.Applying this information to the existing knowledge that radiation induces cancer inanimals, the doctrine of genetic determinism inferred that the radiation \"bystandereffect\" is just another mechanism by which radiation produces the \"mutant cancer cell\"or clone of cancer cells. But the difference between events in vitro and in vivo is thatcells which are injured in the organism immediately initiate a process of healing, and inthat situation each of the substances emitted by injured cells is acting both locally andsystemically to activate repair or regeneration of the damaged tissue. Cells isolated in aculture dish can't call on the organism for the necessary materials, so the responses ofthe \"bystander\" cells, leading to mutations and death, seem meaningless. The injuredcells are merely toxic, rather than potentially being a stimulus to healing.When any part of a living organism is injured, for example by x-rays or surgery, theemitted substances affect the endocrine and nervous systems, activating processes thatchange metabolism and behavior. The injured tissue takes on new functions, forexample by locally synthesizing estrogen, cortisol (Vukelic, et al., 2011), and otherhormones, as well as stimulating the normal endocrine glands to secrete them. Theseinteractions have been generally disregarded in cancer treatment, because of the gene centeredtheory of cancer, but they are essential for understanding the \"malignancy\" oftumors, that property that makes them likely to return after the tumor has beendestroyed, and to spread to other tissues. Has anyone ever heard of a radiologist orsurgeon who measured estrogen or the various mediators of inflammation before,during, and after their treatments? Long range survival after breast cancer surgery isaffected by the time in the menstrual cycle when the surgery is done (Lemon, et al.,1996).All sorts of stress, inflammation, and tissue injury increase the concentration ofestrogen, both locally and systemically. Estrogen in turn produces hypoxia, swelling,lactic acid formation, and stimulates cell multiplication. Even a brief period of hypoxiawill cause the secretion of lactate and other chemoattractants (Neumann, et al., 1993),which will cause cells to move into the hypoxic area from the blood stream. Althoughlactic acid attracts immune cells, it probably reduces their anticancer functions, and itstimulates the formation of new blood vessels, supporting continued growth andexpansion of the multiplying cells (Hirschhaeuer, et al., 2011). When a tissue is beingrepaired normally, the new cells sense a quorum, and stop multiplying. The return ofnerves to the damaged area is part of the regenerative process; nerves have inductiveand stabilizing effects on differentiating cells.These complex interactions between tumor cells and the rest of the organism are notconsidered by the ideology of medical oncologists. The ruling belief is that themalignancy of cells can be determined by examining them microscopically, and thattheir rate of growth can be determined, and that the tumor's approximate time of origincan be estimated. After surgically removing a tumor, the administration of chemotherapyand/or radiation is governed by mathematical descriptions of the expected behavior ofcancer cells.The mathematical relation of mortality to aging was described by Benjamin Gompertz,an actuary, in 1825, based on the understanding that people become less able to resistdying as they get older. This Gompertzian growth curve, which is realistic when appliedto a population of people, flies, or rabbits, was applied to tumor growth (A.K. Laird, in1964). Gompertz' reasoning that the probability of a person's dying increases with agehas nothing to do with cancer cells, and there is very little evidence that his law ofgrowth is useful for describing tumors. Laird's evidence consisted of 19 tumor samples,taken from 10 mice, 8 rats, and a rabbit. Her suggestion that the continuing decelerationof the growth rate might represent a natural growth regulating process wasn't influential,but her use of an actuarial formula, suggesting certain properties of cancer cells, hasbeen extremely influential. It seems to be the profession's great need for justificationthat has made a Law of Tumor Growth so important to them.At the time Laird did the tumor growth study, there was considerable interest in the ideathat the immune system could be induced to prevent tumor growth. In 1951, ChesterSoutham, of the Sloan-Kettering Institute, tested his theory of cancer immunity onhundreds of patients and prisoners, and his results were widely reported. He found thatpieces of tumor implanted in healthy people caused a local intense inflammation, whichhealed completely after two or three weeks. In sick people, the rejection of the cancerimplant took about twice as long, and in people who already had cancer, the implantwas very slow to be destroyed, and sometimes it was still present when they died.In 1889, Stephen Paget had noticed that cancers metastasize only into certain organs,and compared the cancer cells to seeds that \"can only live and grow if they fall oncongenial soil.\" While many people, like Southam, saw a failing \"immune system\" aspart of the congenial soil, and suggested vaccination to activate an immune rejection ofthe tumor, others have suggested \"reducing the soil to dust,\" making growth impossiblein a more general way. Recently, this attitude has taken the form of different ways of\"starving\" cancer, by reducing sugar in the diet, or by blocking cells' ability to use sugar.The idea of making the \"soil\" inhospitable to cancer is a variation on the theme of killingthe unwanted tissue.As long as the lump is defined as an alien material, killing it by any means seemsreasonable, but if it is seen as the body's attempt to repair itself, then killing it is no morereasonable than it would be to cut the spots out of someone with smallpox.When a cell is dying, it emits growth stimulating signals (Huang, et al., 2011). That's anormal part of tissue renewal. Some of its substance guides the differentiation of newcells, as demonstrated long ago by Polezhaev (discussed in my previous article, \"Stemcells, cell culture, and culture: Issues in regeneration\"). Anything that injures a tissueenough to require cells to be replaced causes the activation of a regulatory protein,hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF, which inhibits mitochondrial respiration, causing a shifttoward glycolytic metabolism, increasing substances needed for growth. HIF is essentialto the healing of any wound. Even glucose deprivation can cause the induction of HIF.Prostaglandins, made from polyunsaturated fatty acids released by stimulation, cancause HIF to increase, but HIF also causes prostaglandins to increase. Lactic acidincreases the expression of HIF, while HIF causes cells to shift metabolically to dependon converting glucose to lactic acid, that is, to adopt the \"cancer metabolism.\" HIF isrecognized as a fundamental problem in \"cancer therapy,\" since HIF allows the cancerto resist the treatment, but the treatment increases HIF.Radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery all activate these processes of cell replacement,and unless something has changed to improve the organism's recuperative ability, itisn't clear why the cells which replace the missing part should be more able tosatisfactorily complete the recovery process than the original cells were. Even theamount of radiation in a single dental x-ray is enough to activate the excitatory-inflammatoryprocesses, and a \"therapeutic\" x-ray to any part of the body excites similar, but much greater, processes throughout the body. But the ideology of \"the cancer cell,\" and the Gompertz Growth Law, guide the practice of cancer treatment.Many years ago, Harry Rubin was impressed by hearing from a pathologist that he hadbeen able to find diagnosable cancer somewhere in the body of every person over theage of 50 that he had autopsied. If everyone has cancer by the age of 50, that meansthat cancer is harmless for most people, and that small cancers might frequentlyappear, and be spontaneously removed as part of the body's regular house-cleaning.One of the reasons that spontaneous regression of tumors seems so rare isundoubtedly that most tumors are quickly cut out by surgeons.Preventing injury should be a basic consideration, but the medical slogan, \"first do noharm,\" just doesn't apply to the cancer treatment industry, and this results from thedoctrine of \"the cancer cell,\" which is something to be destroyed or kept frommultiplying. In the process of diagnosing a cancer, and during the course of treating it,the patient is usually subjected to multiple x-ray examinations, sometimes givenradioactive drugs that supposedly concentrate in hidden tumors to emit positrons, andoften has toxic contrast agents injected even for MRI examinations. These procedures,even before the destructive \"therapies\" begin, are adding to the body's inflammatoryburden, interfering with the body's ability to complete a healing process. Decisionsabout pain control usually disregard the effects of the drugs on tumor growth andgeneral vitality--for example, the opiates stimulate histamine release, which increasesinflammation and tumor growth.In 1927, Bernstein and Elias found that rats eating a fat free diet had almost nospontaneous cancer, and many studies since then in animals and people have shown aclose association between polyunsaturated fatty acids and cancer. The polyunsaturatedfatty acids in themselves, and their breakdown products, are excitatory and destabilizingto normal cells, but by modifying the sensitivity and energy production of cells, they limitcells' ability to respond to stimulation and destabilizing influences. Although they aren'tessential for wound healing (Porras-Reyes, et al., 1992), they and their metabolites, theprostaglandins, are very conspicuous in wounds and tumors, and their proportiongenerally increases with aging. The prostaglandins are involved in several viciouscycles, including that with HIF mentioned above. This makes the PUFA andprostaglandins important to consider in relation to optimizing wound healing, anddecreasing cancerization. Aspirin's protective and therapeutic effects in cancer arestarting to be recognized, but there are several other things that can synergize withaspirin to reduce the circulation of free fatty acids and their conversion toprostaglandins. Niacinamide, progesterone, sugar, carbon dioxide, and red light protectagainst both free fatty acids and prostaglandins.Since excitation leads to intracellular alkalinity and swelling, reducing the excitationseems reasonable, and many things which protect cells against excitation also havedemonstrated anticancer effects. Local anesthetics, antihistamines, and antiinflammatorysubstances and some anesthetics such as xenon (Weigt, et al., 2009) are safe. Inhibitory substances related to GABA are being investigated for their ability to stop tumor growth. Simply stopping excessive excitation tends to restore the dominance of oxidative respiration over glycolysis.To restore the supply of oxygen, sugar, and nutrients, swelling must be stopped.Hyperosmotic fluids act directly on swollen cells, removing water. Stopping excitationallows a return to efficient metabolism and reduces the injury potential, allowing the pHto decrease; with lower pH, the cell releases some of its water.Increasing carbon dioxide lowers the intracellular pH, as well as inhibiting lactic acidformation, and restoring the oxidation of glucose increases CO2. Inhibiting carbonicanhydrase, to allow more CO2 to stay in the cell, contributes to intracellular acidification,and by systemically increasing carbon dioxide this inhibition has a broad range ofprotective anti-excitatory effects. The drug industry is now looking for chemicals that willspecifically inhibit the carbonic anhydrase enzymes that are active in tumors. Existingcarbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, will inhibit those enzymes,without harming other tissues. Aspirin has some effect as an inhibitor of carbonicanhydrase (Bayram, et al., 2008). Since histamine, serotonin (Vullo, et al., 2007), andestrogen (Barnett, et al., 2008; Garg, 1975) are carbonic anhydrase activators, theirantagonists would help to acidify the hypoxic cells. Testosterone (Suzuki, et al., 1996)and progesterone are estrogen antagonists that inhibit carbonic anhydrase.With aging, cells have less ability to produce energy, and are often more easilystimulated. The accumulation of polyunsaturated fats is one of the factors that reducethe ability of mitochondria to produce energy (Zhang, et al., 2006, 2009; Yazbeck, et al.,1989). Increased estrogen exposure, decreased thyroid hormone, an increased ratio ofiron to copper, and lack of light, are other factors that impair the cytochrome oxidaseenzyme.The increased intracellular alkalinity and intracellular calcium that result from thecombination of those factors increase the tendency of cells to be overstimulated,leading to aerobic glycolysis, the cancer metabolism. Improving any part of the systemtends to increase carbon dioxide and decrease lactate, permitting differentiatedfunctioning.There are many people currently recommending fish oil (or other highly unsaturatedoils) for preventing or treating cancer, and it has become almost as common torecommend a sugar free diet, \"because sugar feeds cancer.\" This is often, incorrectly,said to be the meaning of Warburg's demonstration that cancer cells have a respiratorydefect that causes them to produce lactic acid from glucose even in the presence ofoxygen. Cancer cells use glucose and the amino acid glutamine primarily for syntheticpurposes, and use fats as their energy source;the growth stimulating effect of the\"essential fatty acids\" (Sueyoshi and Nagao, 1962a; Holley, et al., 1974) shows thatdepriving a tumor of those fats retards its growth. The great energetic inefficiency of thecancer metabolism, which causes it to produce a large amount of heat and to causesystemic stress, failure of immunity, and weight loss, is because it synthesizes fat fromglucose and amino acids, and then oxidizes the fat as if it were diabetic.Estrogen, which is responsible for the fact that women burn fatty acids more easily thanmen, is centrally involved in this metabolic inefficiency. When a tissue is exposed toestrogen, within minutes it takes up water, and begins to synthesize fat, with a tendencyto produce lactic acid at the same time. The alkalizing effect of lactic acid production isapparently what accounts for the uptake of water. Since it takes longer, at least 30minutes, to produce a significant amount of new enzymes, these early changes areexplained by the activation of existing enzymes by estrogen.The transhydrogenases, or the transhydrogenase function of the steroiddehydrogenases, which shift metabolic energy between glycolytic and oxidativesystems, have been shown to explain these effects of estrogen, but thetranshydrogenases can be activated by many stressors. The biological function of thetranshydrogenases seems to be to allow cells to continue growth and repair processesin a hypoxic environment. Estrogen can start the process by creating new pathways forelectrons, and will promote processes that are started by something else, andprogesterone is estrogen's natural antagonist, terminating the process.Recently, a group at Johns Hopkins University (Le, et al., 2012) has been working outthe implications of this ability to change the metabolism under hypoxia: Using anisotope-labeled amino acid, \". . . glutamine import and metabolism through the TCAcycle persisted under hypoxia, and glutamine contributed significantly to citratecarbons. Under glucose deprivation, glutamine-derived fumarate, malate, andcitrate were significantly increased.\" The implication of this is that if the tumor isn'tsupplied with sugar, it will increase the rate at which it consumes the host's proteins.Forty years ago the work of Shapot and Blinov was showing the same effect, exceptthat they demonstrated the involvement of the whole organism, especially the liver, ininteraction with the tumor (Blinov and Shapot, 1975).The alkaline cancer cell surrounds itself by the acid that it emits, and this extracellularacidity increases the ability of fatty acids to enter the cell (Spector, 1969); cancer cells,although they are synthesizing fat, also avidly take it up from their environment(Sueyoshi and Nagao, 1962b). This fat avidity is so extreme that cancer cells in vitro willeat enough polyunsaturated fat to kill themselves. This has been offered as proof thatfish oil kills cancer. Saturated fats, however, have a calming effect on cancer cells,inhibiting their aerobic glycolysis (Marchut, et al., 1986) while permitting them to resumethe respiratory production of energy.The foods that nourish the patient well enough to support healing while permittingenergy reserves to be built up are also the foods that don't interfere with the hormones,that don't cause spurious excitation of the tissues. The polyunsaturated fats directlystimulate the stress hormones, activate the excitatory amino acid signals, and directlyexcite cells, while the saturated fats have opposite effects, and are anti-inflammatory,and also don't interfere with mitochondrial function. When we eat more carbohydratethan can be oxidized, some of it will be turned into saturated fats and omega-9 fats, andthese will support mitochondrial energy production. Carbohydrates in the diet also helpto decrease the mobilization of fatty acids from storage; niacinamide and aspirin supportthat effect. Sugars are probably more favorable than starches for the immune system(Harris, et al., 1999), and failure of the immune system is a common feature of cancer.Polyunsaturated fats are generally known to suppress the immune system. Foods thatprovide generous amounts of sodium, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, help tominimize stress. Trace minerals and vitamins are important, but can be harmful if usedexcessively--iron excess is important to avoid.Emodin, an anti-inflammatory substance found in cascara sagrada bark and otherplants, is similar to other molecules that have been used for treating cancer, and one ofits effects is to lower HIF: \"Consistently, emodin attenuated the expression ofcyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), VEGF, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1!), MMP-1and MMP-13 at mRNA level in IL-1\"and LPS-treated synoviocytes under hypoxia\" (Ha,et al., 2011). MMP-1 and MMP-13 are collagenase enzymes involved in metastasis.When cells are fully nourished, supplied with protective hormones, and properlyilluminated, their ability to communicate should be able to govern their movements,preventing--and possibly reversing--metastatic migration.REFERENCESCancer Res. 2008 May 1;68(9):3505-15.

        "chunk_html": "Mitonchondria and mortality:Diet, exercise, and medicine, damaging or repairing respiratory metabolismMAIN IDEAS AND CONTEXTSLactic acid and carbon dioxidehave opposing effects.Intense exercise damages cellsin ways that cumulatively impair metabolism. There is clear evidence that glycolysis, producing lactic acid from glucose, has toxic effects, suppressing respiration and killing cells.   Within five minutes, exercise lowers the activity of enzymes that oxidize glucose. Diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and general aging involve increased lactic acid production    and    accumulated    metabolic (mitochondrial) damage.The products of glycolysis,lactic acid and pyruvic acid, suppress oxidation of glucose.Adaptationto hypoxia or increased carbon dioxide limits the formation of lactic acid. Muscles are 50% more efficient in the adapted state; glucose, which forms more carbon dioxide than fat does when oxidized,, is metabolized more efficiently than fats, requiring less oxygen.Lactic acidosis,by suppressing oxidation of glucose, increases oxidation of fats, further suppressing glucose oxidation.Estrogenis harmful to mitochondria,progesteroneis beneficial.Progesterone's brain-protectiveand restorative effects involve mitochondrial actions.Thyroid hormone, palmitic acid, and lightactivate a crucial respiratory enzyme, suppressing the formation of lactic acid. Palmitic acid occurs in coconut oit, and is formed naturally in animal tissues. Unsaturated oils have the opposite effect.Heart failure, shock,and other problems involving excess lactic acid can be treated \"successfully\" by poisoning glycolysis with dichloroacetic acid, reducing the production of lactic acid, increasing the oxidation of glucose, and increasing cellular ATP concentration. Thyroid, vitamin B1, biotin, etc., do the same.SOME DEFINITIONSGlycolysis:The conversion of glucose to lactic acid, providing some usable energy, but many times less than oxidation provides.Lactic acid,produced by splitting glucose to pyruvic acid followed by its reduction, is associated with calcium uptake and nitric oxide production, depletes energy, contributing to cell death.Crabtree effect:Inhibition of cellular respiration by an excess of glucose; excess of glucose promotes calcium uptake by cells.Pasteur effect:Inhibition of glycolysis (fermentation) by oxygen.Randle effect:The inhibition of the oxidation of glucose by an excess of fatty acids.  This lowers metabolic efficiency. Estrogen promotes this effect.Lactated Ringer's solution:A salt solution that has\\ been used to increase blood volume in treating shock; the lactate was apparently chosen as a buffer in place of bicarbonate, as a matter of convenience rather than physiology. This solution is toxic, partly because it contains the form of lactate produced by bacteria, but our own lactate, at higher concentrations, produces the same sorts of toxic effect, damaging mitochondria,Estrogenic phytotoxinsdamage mitochondria, kill brain cells; tofu is associated with dementia.===============Since reading Warburg's publications in the late 1960s and early 70s, and doing my own research on tissue respiration, I have been convinced that Warbug was on the right track in seeing mitochondrial respiration as the controlling influence in cell differentiation, and in seeing cancer as a reversion to a primitive form of life based on a \"respiratory defect.\" Harry Rubin's studies of cells in culture have expanded Warburg's picture of the process of cancerization, showing that genetic changes occur only after the cells have been transformed into cancer.It is now well recognized that defective mitochondrial respiration is a central factor in diseases of muscles, brain, liver, kidneys, and other organs. The common view has been that the mitochondrial defects are produced by genetic defects, that are either inherited or acquired, and are irreversible.Mitochondria depend on some genes in the nuclear chromosomes, but they also contain some genes, and mutations in these specific mitochondrial genes have been associated with various diseases, and with aging. Although these aren't the genes that the cancer establishment has focussed on as \"the cause\" of cancer, for people interested in the achievements of Warburg and Rubin, it is important to know whether mutations in these mitochondrial genes are thecauseof respiratory defects, or whether a respiratory defect causes the mutations. Recent research seems to show that physiological problems precede and cause the mutations.Warburg believed that mitochondria supported specialized cell functions by concentrating themselves in the places where energy is needed. This idea has some interesting implications. For example, when the amount of thyroid hormone is increased, or when the organism adapts to a high altitude, the number of mitochondria increases. But in energy deficient states such as diabetes, they don't. How are these crucial organelles called into existence by the hormone that increases respiration and energy, and also by the hypoxic conditions of high altitudes?   In both of these conditions, the availability of oxygen is limiting the ability to produce energy. In both conditions, carbon dioxide concentration in tissue is higher, in one  case,   because  thyroid  stimulates  its production, in the other, because the Haldane effect limits its loss from the lungs.Could carbon dioxide, a major product of mitochondria, help to call mitochondria into existence? My answer to this is \"yes,\" and it will help to briefly explain how I see mitochondria. Although I have no hesitancy in accepting that organelles can be exchanged between species, and that it is conceivable that mitochondria might have been derived from symbiotic bacteria, I am reluctant to believe that something happens just because itcouldhappen.   For example, Francis Crick proposed that life on earth originated when genes arrived here on space dust from some other world. That's a theoretical possibility, but what's the point?  It just avoids explaining how the highly organized material came into existence somewhere else, and it probably seriously interfered with the consideration of the ways life could arise here. Similarly, some people like to think that mitochondria and chloroplasts were originally bacteria, that came into symbiosis with another kind of living material, consisting of nucleus and cytoplasm. Like Crick's \"space germs,\" it can be argued that it's possible, but the problem is that this explanation can stop people from thinking freshly about the nature of the various organelles, and how they came to exist. (How did cells originate?   How did mitochondria originate?   \"Germs.\")Since I have a view of how cells came to exist, under conditions that exist on earth, I should consider whether that view doesn't also reasonably account for their various components. Sidney Fox's proteinoid microspheres provide a good model for the spontaneous formation of primitive cells; variations of that idea can account for the formation of organelles (such as mitochondria and nuclei within cells, and chromosomes within nuclei). The value of this idea, of a self-stimulating process in mitochondrial generation, is that it suggests many ways to test the idea experimentally, and it suggests explanations for developmental and pathological processes that otherwise would have no coherent explanation.Proteinoid microspheres and coacervates form by acquiring molecules from solution, condensing them into a separate phase, with its own physical properties. At every phase boundary, there are numerous physical forces, especially electronic properties, that make each kind of interface different from other kinds.   Small changes of pH, temperature, of salts and other solutes can alter the interfacial forces, causing particles to dissolve, or grow, or fragment, or to move. In the way that carbon dioxide alters the shapes and electrical affinities of hemoglobin and other proteins, I propose that it increases the stability of the mitochondrial coacervate, causing it to \"recruit\" additional proteins from its external environment, as well as from its own synthetic machinery, to enlarge both its structure and its functions.In the relative absence of carbon dioxide, or excess of alternative solutes and adsorbents, such as lactic acid, the stability of the mitochondrial phase would be decreased, and the mitochondria would be degraded in both structure and function. As the back side of the idea that carbon dioxide stabilizes and activates mitochondria, the idea that lactic acid is involved in the degrading of mitochondria can also be tested experimentally, and it is already supported by a considerable amount of circumstantial evidence.This combination of sensitivity to the environment, with a kind of positive feedback or inertia either upward or downward, corresponds to what we actually see in mitochondrial physiology and pathology.The Crabtree effect, which is the suppression of respiration by glycolysis, is often described as the simple opposite of the Pasteur effect, in which respiration limits glycolysis to the rate that allows its product to be consumed oxidatively. But the Pasteur effect is a normal sort of control system; when the Pasteur effect fails, as in cancer, there is glycolysis which is relatively independent of respiration, causing sugar to be consumed inefficiently. Embryonic tissues sometimes behave in this manner, leading to the suggestion that glycolysis is closely related to growth.   Unlike the logical Pasteur effect, the Crabtree effect tends to lower cellular energy and adaptability. Looking at many situations in which increasing the glucose supply increases lactic acid production and suppresses respiration, leading to maladaptive decrease in cellular energy, I have begun thinking of lactic acid as a toxin.   The use of Ringer's lactate solution in medicine has led many people to assume that lactate must be beneficial, or they wouldn't put it in the salt solution that is often used in emergiencies; however, I think its use here, as a buffer, is simply a convenience, because of the instability of some bicarbonate solutions.On the organismic level, it is clear that lactic acid is \"the essence of hyperventilation,\" and that it produces edema and malfunction on a grand scale: The panic reaction, shock lung, vascular leakiness, brain swelling, and finally multiple organ failure, all can be traced to an excess of lactic acid, and the related features of hyperventilated physiology.Otto Warburg apparently thought of lactate as simply a sign of the respiratory defect that characterizes cancer. V. S. Shapot at least hinted at its possible role in turning on the catabolic reactions leading to cancer cachexia (wasting). I think a good case can be made for lactate as thecauseof the respiratory defect in cancer, just as it is usually the immediate cause of the respiratory derangement of hyperventilation on the organismic level.The Crabtree effect is usually thought of as just something that happens in tumors, and some tissues that are very active glycolytically, and some bacteria, when they are given large amounts of glucose. But when we consider lactate, which is produced by normal tissues when they are deprived of oxygen or are disturbed by a stress reaction, the Crabtree effect becomes a very general thing. The \"respiratory defect\" that we can see on the organismic level during hyperventilation, is very similar to the \"systemic Crabtree effect\" that happens during stress, in which respiration is shut down while glycolysis is activated. Since oxidative metabolism is many times more efficient for producing energy than glycolysis is, it is maladaptive to shut it down during stress.Since the presence of lactate is so commonly considered to be a normal and adaptive response to stress, the shut-down of respiration in the presence of lactate is generally considered to be caused by something else, with lactate being seen as an effect rather than a cause. Nitric oxide and calcium excess have been identified as the main endogenous antirespiratory factors in stress, though free unsaturated fatty acids are clearly involved, too.   However, glycolysis, and the products of glycolysis, lactate and pyruvate, have been found to have a causal role in the suppression of respiration; it is both a cause and a consequence of the respiratory shutdown, though nitric oxide, calcium, and fatty acids are closely involved,Since lactic acid is produced by the breakdown of glucose, a high level of lactate in the blood means that a large amount of sugar is being consumed; in response, the body mobilizes free fatty acids as an additional source of energy. An increase of free fatty acids suppresses the oxidation of glucose. (This is called the Randle effect, glucose-fatty acid cycle, substrate-competition cycle, etc.) Women, with higher estrogen and growth hormone, usually have more free fatty acids than men, and during exercise oxidize a higher proportion of fatty acids than men do. This fatty acid exposure \"decreases glucose tolerance,\" and undoubtedly  explains  women's  higher incidence of diabetes.  While most fatty acids inhibit the oxidation of glucose without immediately inhibiting glycolysis, palmitic acid is unusual, in its inhibition of glycolysis and lactate production without inhibitng oxidation. I assume that this largely has to do with its important function in cardiolipin and cytochrome oxidase.Exercise, like aging, obesity, and diabetes, increases the levels of circulating free fatty acids and lactate. But ordinary activity of an integral sort, activates the systems in an organized way, increasing carbon dioxide and circulation and efficiency. Different types of exercise have been identified as destructive or reparative to the mitochondria; \"concentric\" muscular work is said to be restorative to the mitochondria. As I understand it, this means contraction with a load, and relaxation without a load. The heart's contraction follows this principle, and this could explain the observation that heart mitochondria don't change in the course of ordinary aging.When a person has an accident, or surgery, and goes into shock, the degree of lactic acidema is recognized as an indicator of the severity of the problem.   Lactated Ringer's solution has been commonly used to treat these people, to restore their blood pressure. But when prompt treatment with lactated Ringer's solution has been compared with no early treatment at all, the patients who are not \"rescuscitated\" do better than those who got the early treatment. And when Ringer's lactate has been compared with various other solutions, synthetic starch solutions, synthetic hemoglobin polymer solution, or simply a concentrated solution of sodium chloride, those who received the lactate solution did least well. For example, of 8 animals treated with another solution, 8 survived, while among 8 treated with Ringer's lactate, 6 died.Mitochondrial metabolism is now being seen as the basic problem in aging and several degenerative diseases. The tendency has been to see random genetic deterioration as the driving force behind mitochondrial aging.  Genetic repair in mitochondria was assumed not to occur. However, recently two kinds of genetic repair have been demonstrated. One in which the DNA strand is repaired, and another, in which sound mitochondria are \"recruited\" to replace the defective, mutated, \"old\" mitochondria.In ordinary nuclear chromosomal genes, DNA repair is well known. The other kind of repair, in which unmutated cells replace the. genetically damaged cells, has been commonly observed in the skin of the face: During intense sun exposure, mutant cells accumulate; but after a period in which the skin hasn't been exposed to the damaging radiation, the skin is made up of healthy \"young\" cells.In the way that the skin can be seen to recover from genetic damage, that had been considered to be permanent and cumulative, simply by avoiding the damaging factor, mitochondrial aging is coming to be seen as both avoidable and repairable.The stressful conditions that physiologically harm mitochondria are now being seen as the probable cause for the mitochondrial genetic defects that accumulate with aging.   Stressful exercise, which has been known to cause breakage of the nuclear chromosomes, is now seen to damage mitochondrial genes, too.   Providing energy, while reducing stress, seems to be all it takes to reverse the accumulated mitochondrial genetic damage.Fewer mitochondrial problems will be considered to be inherited, as we develop an integral view of the ways in which mitochondrial physiology is disrupted. Palmitic acid, which is a major component of the cardiolipin which regulates the main respiratory enzyme, becomes displaced by polyunsaturated fats as aging progresses. Copper tends to be lost from this same enzyme system, and the state of the water is altered as the energetic processes change.While the flow of carbon dioxide moves from the mitochondrion to the cytoplasm and beyond, tending to remove calcium from the mitochondrion and cell, the flow of lactate and other organic ions into the mitochondrion can produce calcium accumulation in the mitochondrion, during conditions in which carbon dioxide synthesis,  and consequently urea synthesis,  are depressed, and other synthetic processes are changed.Glycolysis produces both pyruvate and lactate, and excessive pyruvate produces almost the same inhibitory effect as lactate; since the Crabtree effect involves nitric oxide and fatty acids as well as calcium, I think it is reasonable to look for the simplest sort of explanation, instead of trying to experimentally trace all the possible interactions of these substances; a simple physical competition between the products of glycolysis and carbon dioxide, for the binding sites, such as lysine, that would amount to a phase change in the mitochondrion.  Glucose, and apparently glycolysis, are required for the production of nitric oxide, as for the accumulation of calcium, at least in some types of cell, and these coordinated changes, which lower energy production,  could be produced by a reduction in carbon dioxide, in a physical change even more basic than the energy level represented by ATP. The use of Krebs cycle substances in the synthesis of amino acids, and other products, would decrease the formation of C02, creating a situation in which the system would have two possible states, one, the glycolytic stress state, and the other, the carbon dioxide producing energy-efficient state.Besides the frequently discussed interactions of excessively accumulated iron with the unsaturated fatty acids, producing lipid peroxides and other toxins, the accumulated calcium very probably forms some insoluble soaps with the free fatty acids which are released even from intracellular fats during stress.     The growth of new mitochondria probably occasionally leaves behind such useless materials, combining soaps, iron, and porphyrins remaining from damaged respiratory enzymes.When the background of carbon dioxide is high, circulation and oxygenation tend to prevent the anaerobic glycolysis that produces toxic lactic acid, so that a given level of activity will be harmful or helpful, depending on the level of carbon dioxide being produced at rest.Preventively, avoiding foods containing lactic acid, such as yogurt and sauerkraut, would be helpful, since bacterial lactic acid is much more toxic than the type that we form under stress. Avoiding the stress-promoting antithyroid unsaturated oils is extremely important. Their role in diabetes, cancer, and other age-related and degenerative diseases (and I think this includes the estrogen-promoted autoimmune diseases) is well established. Avoiding phytoestrogens and other things that increase estrogen exposure, such as protein deficiency, is important, because estrogen causes increased levels of free fatty acids, increases the tendency to metabolize them at the expense of glucose metabolism, increases the tissue content of unsaturated fatty acids, and inhibits thyroid functions.Light promotes glucose oxidation, and is known to activate the key respiratory enzyme. Winter sickness (including lethargy and weight gain), and night stress, have to be included within the idea of the \"respiratory defect,\" shifting to the antirespiratory production of lactic acid, and damaging the mitochondria.Therapeutically, even powerful toxins that block the glycolytic enzymes can improve functions in a variety of organic disturbances \"associated with\" (caused by) excessive production of lactic acid. Unfortunately, the toxin that has become standard treatment for lactic acidosis—dichloroacetic acid—is a carcinogen, and eventually produces liver damage and acidosis. But several nontoxic therapies can do the same things:Palmitate (formed from sugar under the influence of thyroid hormone, and found in coconut oil), vitamin Bl, biotin, lipoic acid, carbon dioxide, thyroid, naloxone, acetazolamide, for example.Progesterone, by blocking estrogen's disruptive effects on the mitochondria, ranks along with thyroid and a diet free of polyunsaturate fats, for importance in mitochondrial maintenance.REFERENCESBiochim Biophys Acta 1999 Feb 9;1410(2):171-82Mitochondrial     involvement     in     Alzheimer'sdisease.Bonilla E, Tanji K, Hirano M, Vu TH, DiMauro S, Schon EA.Rev Pneumol Clin 1986;42(5):238-41.Acid-base balance and blood lactate and pyruvate levels in albino rats bred under normobaric hypoxia or normoxia, after muscular work in a hypoxic or hypoxic-hypercapnic environment.Quatrini U, Licciardi A.Muscle Nerve 1999 Feb;22(2):258-61.Acute exercise causes mitochondrial DNA deletion in rat skeletal muscle.Sakai Y, Iwamura Y, Hayashi J, Yamamoto N, Ohkoshi N, Nagata H.HumMol Genet 1999 Jun;8(6): 1047-52.Gene shifting:a novel therapy for mitochondrial myopathy.Taivassalo T, Fu K,Johns T, Arnold D, Karpati G, Shoubridge EA.Brain Dev 1989;11(3):195-7.Effect of sodium dichloroacetate on human pyruvate metabolism.Naito E, Kuroda Y, Toshima K, Takeda E, Saijo T, Kobashi H, Yokota I, Ito M.Mech Ageing Dev 1987 Aug;39(3):281-8.Lack of age-dependent changes in rat heart mitochondria.Manzelmann MS, Harmon HJ.Adv Shock Res 1978,1:105-16.The effect of mitochondrial dysfunction on glucose metabolism during shock.Rhodes RS.Biochem J 1982 Dec 15;208(3):695-701Exercise-induced alterations of hepatic mitochondrial function.Tate CA, Wolkowicz PE, McMillin-Wood, J.Am J Physiol 1997 Dec;273(6 Pt 2):F869-76.Neurosteroid inhibition of cell death.Waters SL, Miller GW, Aleo MD, Schnellmann RG.J Pharmacol Exp Ther 1990.

        "chunk_html": "Heart and hormonesThe heart's unique behavior has given cardiologists a particularly mechanical perspective on biology. If a cardiologist and an oncologist have anything to talk about, it's likely to be about why cancer treatments cause heart failure; a cardiologist and an endocrinologist might share an interest in \"cardioprotective estrogen\" and \"cardiotoxic obesity.\" Cell physiology and bioenergetics aren't likely to be their common interest. Each specialty has its close involvement with the pharmaceutical industry, shaping its thinking.The drug industry has been lowering the numbers for cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose that are considered to be the upper limit of normal, increasing the number of customers for their prescription drugs. Recently, publications have been claiming that the upper limit of the normal range of heart rates should be lower than 100 beats per minute; this would encourage doctors to prescribe more drugs to slow hearts, but the way the evidence is being presented, invoking the discredited \"wear and tear\" theory of aging, could have many unexpected harmful consequences. It would reinforce existing misconceptions about heart functions.A few decades ago, diuretics to lower blood pressure and digitalis/digoxin to increase the heart's strength of contraction were the main treatments for heart disease. In 1968, the annual number of deaths in the US from congestive heart failure (in which the heart beats more weakly, pumping less blood) was 10,000. By 1993 the number had increased to 42,000 per year. More recently, the annual number of deaths in which heart failure is the primary cause was more than 55,000. During these decades, many new drugs for treating heart disease were introduced, and the use of digoxin has decreased slightly. People with heart failure usually live with the condition for several years; at present about 5.7 million people in the US live with heart failure. The prevalence of, and mortality from, other cardiovascular diseases (such as hypertension and abnormalities of the coronary arteries) are higher, but congestive heart failure is especially important to understand, because it involves defective function of the heart muscle itself.Although Albert Szent-Gyorgyi is known mostly for his discovery of vitamin C and his contribution to understanding the tricarboxylic acid or Krebs cycle, his main interest was in understanding the nature of life itself, and he focused mainly on muscle contraction and cancer growth regulation. In one of his experiments, he compared the effects of estrogen and progesterone on rabbit hearts. A basic property of the heart muscle is that when it beats more frequently, it beats more strongly. This is called the staircase effect, from the way a tracing of its motion rises, beat by beat, as the rate of stimulation is increased. This is a logical way to behave, but sometimes it fails to occur: In shock, and in heart failure, the pulse rate increases, without increasing the volume of blood pumped in each contraction.Szent-Gyorgyi found that estrogen treatment decreased the staircase effect, while progesterone treatment increased the staircase. He described the staircase as a situation in which function (the rate of contraction) builds structure (the size of the contraction). Progesterone allowed \"structure\" to be built by the contraction, and estrogen prevented that.(It's interesting to compare these effects of the hormones to the more general idea of anabolic and catabolic hormones, in which more permanent structures in cells are affected.)The rapid and extensive alternation of contraction and relaxation made possible by progesterone is also produced by testosterone (Tsang, et al., 2009). Things that increase the force of contraction are called inotropic, and the things that promote relaxation are called lusitropic; progesterone and testosterone are both positively inotropic and lusitropic, improving contraction and relaxation. Estrogen is a negative lusitropic hormone (Filice, et al., 2011), and also a negative inotropic hormone (Sitzler, et al., 1996), that is, it impairs both relaxation and contraction.Another standard term describing heart function is chronotropy, referring to the frequency of contraction. Because of the staircase interaction of frequency and force, there has been some confusion in classifying drugs according to chronotropism. In a state of shock or estrogen dominance, an inotropic drug will slow the heart rate by increasing the amount of blood pumped. This relationship caused digitalis' effect to be thought of as primarily slowing the rate of contraction (Willins and Keys, 1941), though its main effect is positively inotropic. It was traditionally used to treat edema, by stimulating diuresis, which is largely the result of its inotropic action. Progesterone and testosterone's inotropic action can also slow the heart beat by strengthening it.I think it was a little before Szent-Gyorgyi's heart experiment that Hans Selye had discovered that a large dose of estrogen created a shock-like state. Shock and stress cause estrogen to increase, and decrease progesterone and testosterone.About 30 years after Szent-Gyorgyi's work, people began to realize that digoxin and other heart stimulating molecules can be found in animals and humans, as metabolites of progesterone and possibly DHEA (Somogyi, et al., 2004).The regulatory proteins that are involved in estrogen's negative lusi- and inotropic actions (decreasing pumping action) have been known for over 20 years to be regulated by the thyroid hormone to produce positive lusi- and inotropic actions on the heart (increasing its pumping action), and thyroid's beneficial effects on heart and skeletal muscle have been known empirically for 100 years. However, drug centered cardiologists, reviewing the currently available drugs approved by the FDA, have typically concluded that \"drugs targeted to achieve these objectives are not available\" (Chatterjee, 2002).When a muscle or nerve is fatigued, it swells, retaining water. When the swelling is extreme, its ability to contract is limited. Excess water content resembles a partly excited state, in which increased amounts of sodium and calcium are free in the cytoplasm. Energy is needed to eliminate the sodium and calcium, or to bind calcium, allowing the cell to extrude excess water and return to the resting state. Thyroid hormone allows cells' mitochondria to efficiently produce energy, and it also regulates the synthesis of the proteins (phospholamban and calcisequestrin) that control the binding of calcium. When the cell is energized, by the mitochondria working with thyroid, oxygen, and sugar, these proteins rapidly change their form, binding calcium and removing it from the contractile system, allowing the cell to relax, to be fully prepared for the next contraction. If the calcium isn't fully and quickly bound, the cell retains extra water and sodium, and isn't able to fully relax.Heart failure is described as \"diastolic failure\" when the muscle isn't able to fully relax. In an early stage, this is just a waterlogged (Iseri, et al., 1952), fatigued condition, but when continued, the metabolic changes lead to fibrosis and even to calcification of the heart muscle.Many children approaching puberty, as estrogen is increasing and interfering with thyroid function, have \"growing pains,\" in which muscles become tense and sore after prolonged activity. When hypothyroidism is severe, it can cause myopathy, in which the painful swollen condition involves the leakage of muscle proteins (especially myoglobin) into the blood stream, allowing it to be diagnosed by a blood test. The combination of hypothyroidism with fatigue and stress can lead to the breakdown and death of muscle cells, rhabdomyolysis.The blood lipid lowering drugs, statins and fibrates, impair mitochondrial respiration (Satoh, et al., 1995, 1994; Brunmair, et al., 2004), and increase the incidence of rhabdomyolysis (Barker, et al., 2003; Wu, et al., 2009; Fallah, et al., 2013). Interference with coenzyme Q10 is not the only mechanism by which they can cause myopathy (Nakahara, et al., 1998). The harmful effect of lowering cholesterol seems to be relevant to heart failure: \"In light of the association between high cholesterol levels and improved survival in HF, statin or other lipid-lowering therapy in HF remains controversial (Horwich, 2009).Heart muscle and skeletal muscle are similar in their structural responses to interference with mitochondrial functions, namely, swelling, reduced contractile ability, and dissolution. When myoglobin has been found in the blood and urine, it has been assumed to come from skeletal muscles, but the heart's myoglobin has been found to be depleted in a patient with myoglobinuria (Lewin and Moscarello, 1966). When heart failure is known to exist, similar changes can be found in the skeletal muscles (van der Ent, et al., 1998).Stress, in the form of pressure-overload (Zhabyeyev, et al., 2013), or overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system (Mori, et al., 2013) and sympathetic nervous system or adrenergic chemicals (Mori, et al., 2012), or a failure of energy caused by diabetes, insulin deficiency, or hypothyroidism, causes a shift of energy production from the oxidation of glucose to the oxidation of fatty acids, with the release, rather than oxidation, of the lactic acid produced from glucose. This sequence, from reduced efficiency of energy production to heart failure, can be opposed by agents that reduce the availability of fatty acids and promote the oxidation of glucose. Niacinamide inhibits the release of free fatty acids from the tissues, and thyroid sustains the oxidation of glucose. This principle is now widely recognized, and the FDA has approved a drug that inhibits the oxidation of fatty acids (raloxazine, 2006), but which has serious side effects. Glucose oxidation apparently is necessary for preventing the intracellular accumulation of free calcium and fatty acids (Jeremy, et al., 1992; Burton, et al., 1986; Ivanics, et al., 2001). The calcium binding protein which is activated by thyroid and inhibited by estrogen seems to be activated by glucose and inhibited by fatty acids (Zarain-Herzberg and Rupp, 1999).Diabetes or fasting increases free fatty acids, and forces cells to shift from oxidation of glucose to oxidation of fatty acids, inhibiting the binding of calcium (McKnight, et al., 1999). Providing a small amount of sugar (0.8% sucrose in their drinking water) restored the calcium binding and heart function, without increasing either thyroid hormone or insulin (Rupp, et al., 1988, 1999, 1994). Serum glucose was lowered, as the ability to oxidize sugar was restored by lowering free fatty acids. Activity of the sympathetic nervous system is lowered as efficiency is increased.Digoxin stimulates mitochondrial energy production in skeletal and heart muscle (Tsyganil, et al., 1982), increasing the oxidation of glucose, rather than fatty acids, supporting the effect of thyroid hormone. The statins have the opposite effect, decreasing the oxidation of glucose.One of estrogen's effects is to chronically increase the circulation of free fatty acids, and to favor the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA. These fatty acids, which slow the heart rate (Kang and Leaf, 1994), extend the excited state (action potential: Li, et al., 2011), and are negatively inotropic (Dhein, et al., 2005; Macleod, et al., 1998; Negretti, et al., 2000), are being proposed as heart protective drugs. (EPA and alpha-linoleic acid also prolong the QT interval: Dhein, et al., 2005).Many publications still promote estrogen as a cardioprotective drug, but there is now increased recognition of its role in heart failure and sudden cardiac death. A prolonged excited state (action potential) and delayed relaxation (QT interval) are known to increase the risk of arrhythmia and sudden death, and estrogen, which causes those changes in humans, causes sudden cardiac death in susceptible rabbits, with an adrenergic stimulant increasing the arrhythmias, and progesterone and androgen preventing them (Odening et al., 2012). Progesterone's protective effect seems to be the result of accelerating recovery of the resting state (Cheng, et al., 2012).Estrogen's interactions with adrenalin in promoting blood vessel constriction has been known for many years (for example, Cheng and Gruetter, 1992). Progesterone blocks that effect of estrogen (Moura and Marcondes, 2001). Environmental estrogens such as BPA can exacerbate ventricular arrhythmia caused by estrogen (Yan, et al., 2013). The hearts of mice genetically engineered to lack aromatase, the enzyme that synthesizes estrogen, were more resistant to damage by being deprived of blood for 25 minutes (Bell, et al., 2011), leading the authors to suggest that aromatase inhibition might be helpful for heart disease.In the stressed, energy depleted failing heart, muscle cells die and are replaced by connective tissue cells. The growth produced by over-exposure to adrenergic stimulation leads to stiffening and reduced functioning. However, under the influence of thyroid hormone a high work load leads to functional enlargement, which simply increases the pumping ability. Because of the traditional belief that heart cells can't replicate, this functional growth was believed to be produced purely by the enlargement of cells, but in recent years the existence of stem cells able to create new heart muscle has been recognized. Thyroid is likely to be one of the hormones responsible for allowing stem cells to differentiate into cardiomyocytes.In this context, of cellular differentiation as a life-long process, we can see the changes of a failing heart as a differentiation which is forced to take an inappropriate course. The calcification of blood vessels caused by phosphate excess and vitamin K deficiency involves the expression of a protein which has its proper place in the skeleton. The replacement of heart muscle by fibrous connective tissue and even bone is a basic biological problem of differentiation, and the responsible factors--stress, increased estrogen, deficient thyroid hormone, suppression of glucose oxidation by fatty acids, etc.--are involved in the problems of differentiation that occur in other degenerative processes, such as sarcopenia, dementia, and cancer.There have been arguments about the nature of wound healing and regeneration, regarding the origin of the new cells--whether they are from the dedifferentiation of local cells, or the migration of stem cells. The evidence is that both can occur, depending on the tissue and the situation. The deterioration of an organ is probably not a question of a lack of stem cells, but of changed conditions causing them to differentiate into something inappropriate for the full functioning of that organ.Various stresses can cause cells to dedifferentiate, but hypoxia is probably a common denominator. In the absence of estrogen, hypoxia can activate the \"estrogen receptor.\"  Estrogen is in some situations a hormone of dedifferentiation, facilitating the formation of new cells in stressed tissues, as aromatase is induced. However, the presence of polyunsaturated fats, tending to increase in concentration with age, causes the processes of renewal to produce exaggerated inflammation, with prostaglandins participating in the processes of development and differentiation. Estrogen, by increasing the concentration of free fatty acids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids, contributes to the metabolic shift away from glucose oxidation, toward the formation of lactic acid, and away from the full organ-specific differentiation.This perspective puts heart failure, cancer, and the other degenerative diseases onto the same biological basis, and shows why certain conditions and therapies can be appropriate for all of them.Problems that seem relatively trivial become more meaningful when they are seen in terms of these mechanisms. Some problems that become very common by middle age are \"palpitations,\" orthostatic hypotension, orthostatic tachycardia, and varicose veins. The negative inotropic effect of estrogen in the heart has a parallel in the smooth muscle of veins, in which the muscles are weakened, and their distensibility increased, when estrogen isn't sufficiently opposed by progesterone. This allows the veins in the lower part of the body to be distended abnormally when standing, reducing the amount of blood returning to the heart, so that the volume pumped with each stroke is small, requiring faster beating. The reduced blood volume reaching the brain can cause fainting. When it becomes chronic, it can lead to the progressive distortion of the veins. An excess of estrogen is associated with varicose veins in men, as well as women. (Raj, 2006; Ciardullo, et al., 2000; Kendler, et al., 2009; Asciutto, et al., 2010; Raffetto, et al., 2010).The simplicity of things such as supplementing thyroid, progesterone, and sugar, avoiding an excess of phosphate in relation to calcium, and avoiding polyunsaturated fats, makes it possible for people to take action themselves, without having to depend on the medical system. Most physicians still warn their patients of the dangers of thyroid supplements, especially the active T3 hormone, for their heart, but in at least one specialty, its value is recognized. Heart transplant surgeons have discovered that administering T3 to the brain-dead heart donor before removing the heart improves its viability and function in the recipient (Novitzky, 1996). Around this time, the manufacturers of Cytomel conceived the idea of marketing it as a \"heart drug,\" which would make it much more profitable.Another technique that is easy to use to lower blood pressure and improve heart rhythm is to breathe into a paper bag for a minute or two at a time, to increase the carbon dioxide content of the blood. This has a vasodilating effect, reducing the force required to circulate the blood, and reduces anxiety. Rhubarb and emodin (a chemical found in rhubarb and cascara) have been found to have heart protective actions. A considerable amount of research showed that vitamin K is effective for treating hypertension, but again, most doctors warn against its use, because of its reputation as a clot forming vitamin. Recently, the value of the \"blood thinner\" warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, has been questioned for people with heart failure (An, et al., 2013; Lee, et al., 2013). There have been several recent warnings about the production of arrhythmia by drugs that increase serotonin's effects (e.g., Stillman, et al., 2013).Measuring the speed of relaxation of the Achilles tendon reflex twitch is a traditional method for judging thyroid function, because in hypothyroidism the relaxation is visibly delayed. This same retardation can be seen in the electrocardiogram, as a prolonged QT interval, which is associated with arrhythmia and sudden death. Insomnia, mania, and asthma are other conditions in which defective relaxation is seen, under the influence of low thyroid function, and an insufficiently opposed influence of estrogen.REFERENCESJ Pathol. 2000 Aug;191(4):434-42.

        "chunk_html": "The Cancer MatrixIt isn't hard to understand that in heart failure the heart is undergoing changes in a unitary way, with all parts of the organ affected, and that parallel changes are happening in the rest of the body, interacting with and contributing to the changes in the heart, so that heart failure is now considered to be a systemic disease. (Most doctors see the systemic nature of heart disease, at least to the extent of warning their patients to lower cholesterol and avoid thyroid hormone.) But if someone tells a cancer patient or an oncologist that cancer is a systemic disease, the thought will be flatly rejected as untrue. They have been taught that cancer is a disease of bad, mutated, cells, which have to be completely eradicated, and that the patient's general health is a separate issue.The US government (NIH, CDC) provides a cancer curriculum to schools. For high school, grades 9-12, they explain that a series of gene mutations causes it. In grade school, the basic idea of the cancer curriculum is just to teach them to fear cancer and the sunlight which, according to the curriculum, seems to be a very important mutagen.The gene mutation theory of cancer is sustained by a broader mystique of \"genetics\" in our culture. Over 100 years ago, an ideology of chance and random changes in organisms was superimposed onto the theory of evolution. After 1944, when Avery, MacLeod and McCarty showed that strands of DNA carry hereditary information, the doctrine of random change took on a specific chemical meaning--changes in the sequence of bases in the DNA molecule. This made it easier to disregard the evidence of the inheritance of acquired changes, since chemical, even biochemical, reactions are usually interpreted statistically, with an assumption of randomness. If the changes in the DNA code are random, and not influenced by the organism's physiology and biochemistry, then the four nucleotides that make up DNA (abbreviated G, C, A, and T) should show a random composition, but in fact the ratio of GC pairs to AT pairs varies in different types of organism, and in mitochondrial DNA, the GC (guanine-cytosine) content corresponds closely to the rate of oxidative metabolism and longevity (Lehmann, et al., 2008).The official (government and American Cancer Society) view of cancer is that a tumor consists of the descendants of a single mutated cell. A current \"proof\" of this is that in a given tumor, all of the X chromosomes which are active have the same genetic composition, while in the rest of the organism, the X chromosome which remains active is a matter of chance. That shows, they argue, that the tumor must have developed from a cell in which that chromosome was active, not from a group of cells. However, non-random inactivation of X chromosomes is now known to occur, and that it involves epigenetic imprinting processes, such as methylation (Falconer, et al., 1982; Heard, 2004). Mary Lyon, the person who discovered that females inactivate one of their X chromosomes, has recognized the complexity of the process (Lyon, 2004). In arguing against the idea that the development of cancer is an epigenetic process, the cancer-gene people have invoked a process that responds to epigenetic influences.The assumption of randomness, and the assertions of the cancer doctors who subscribe to the doctrine, have had terrible effects on biology and medicine. Following the doctrine, their treatments must concentrate on eliminating every single cell of the cancer clone. Since surgery can't eliminate defective cells that have entered the blood stream, radiation and chemical toxins are logical necessities. Since mutations are random events, the person's general health is of little importance to the oncologist. Typically, they will tell the patient that their diet doesn't matter, except that they should avoid antioxidants if they are going to have radiation therapy.For centuries, the definition of a malignant tumor has been that it's one which will return after it has been cut out. In recent years, the definition has been extended to those that return after the original tumor has been eliminated by radiation or chemotherapy. The idea of a \"cancer stem cell,\" an especially tough type of cell from the mutated clone, has been invoked to explain the reason for the regrowth of a tumor in an area that was treated with intense radiation. However, it's now clear that normal cells are attracted to an irradiated area (Klopp, et al., 2007; Kidd, et al., 2009). The recognition of a \"bystander effect,\" in which radiation (or other--Mothersill and Seymour, 2009) injury to one cell injures near-by cells by signals from the injured cell, has led to the recognition that ordinary stem cells or repair cells entering an area where a tumor has been destroyed will be modified by the residual damage of cells in the area. The ability to recruit normal cells into a damaged area, the \"cancer field,\" the way normal organs do, shows that tumors can be thought of as organ-like structures, and that knowledge of the organizing principles of normal organs might improve our knowledge of tumors. The idea that cancer is primarily a problem of organization isn't new: Johannes Muller, in the 19th century, and J.W. Orr, and D.W. Smithers, in the 1940s and 1950s, and many others, have suggested that something outside of the individual cell could cause the disorganization.Once it is accepted that cancer is a systemic disease, and that a tumor, or the place in the body where a tumor has been removed, is something more than a collection of defective cells, very different therapeutic approaches can be considered. Looking at the events in a failing heart, we can see that the potential repair cells recruited by the stressed heart are diverted by the conditions that they encounter there, and either die or become connective tissue cells, secreting collagen, rather than becoming new muscle cells.Something that everyone knows about tumors is that they are harder than the normal tissues in which they appear--they can be identified as lumps. Like the failing heart, they become harder than normal, and like the failing heart, the hardening can proceed to calcification. There has been general recognition that inflammation has a role in both heart disease and cancer, but the fact that chronic inflammation leads to fibrosis, and that fibrosis often leads to calcification, is still usually considered not to be relevant to understanding and treating cancer. The tissue hardness that allows oncologists to diagnose cancer (Huang and Ingber, 2005) is ignored when choosing treatments, which isn't surprising, since treatments that destroy cancer cells increase the production of collagen.Aspirin is commonly recommended for preventing heart attacks, because it helps to prevent abnormal blood clots, but it has other effects that are beneficial in heart disease, for example reducing the generalized fibrosis of the heart that develops after a heart attack (Kalkman, et al., 1995; Wu, et al., 2012). It also protects against fibrosis in other organs, by a variety of mechanisms, and this effect on the extracellular matrix seems to be one of ways in which it protects against cancer. DCA, dichloroacetate, the drug that has been in the news in recent years because it can stop cancer growth, by restoring the oxidation of glucose and stopping the aerobic production of lactic acid, has been found to reduce the fibrosis of a failing heart, by the same mechanism, restoring glucose oxidation. In general, substances that increase collagen production are promoters of cancer and contribute to the progression of heart failure, and other degenerative changes.The incidence of cancer increases exponentially with age, but when random mutations are seen as the cause of cancer, aging as an essential cause of cancer is disregarded. The total collagen content of the body increases with aging, and the stiffness of that collagen also increases. The total collagen content in cancer patients is higher than in people without cancer (Zimin, et al., 2010). This suggests that the processes in the body that produce aging are acting more intensely in those who develop cancer. As the collagen accumulates in the extracellular matrix, the whole body becomes more favorable for the appearance of cancer.Plastic surgeons have promoted the idea of injecting collagen into tissues with the argument that they are \"replacing collagen lost with aging,\" but in fact collagen accumulates with aging. It is the greater compactness and stiffness of collagen in old skin that produces noticeable changes such as wrinkling. The difference between calf skin leather, used for soft gloves and purses, and cow hide, used for shoe soles and boots, illustrates the changes that occur with aging. Supermarkets used to categorize chickens as fryers and stewers, or stewing hens. The difference was the age and toughness, very young chickens could be cooked quickly, old laying hens had accumulated more collagen, and especially the cross-linked hardened collagen, and required long cooking to reduce the toughness. Old beef animals are usually sold as cheaper stew meat or hamburger, because the age-hardened collagen can make a steak too rubbery to chew if it's quickly cooked.In a healthy young organism, tissue injuries are repaired by processes reminiscent of Metchnikov's experiment in which he put a thorn into a jelly fish, and found that wandering cells, phagocytes, converged on the foreign object, surrounding it. If they couldn't eat it, they caused it to be expelled. The importance of that experiment was that it showed that injured tissues emit signals that attract certain types of cell. The process of removing damaged tissues by phagocytosis guides the formation of new tissue, starting with the secretion of collagen, which guides the maturation of the new cells.Around the middle of the last century, Hans Selye experimented with the antiseptic implantation of a short piece of a narrow glass tube under the skin of rats. The irritation from the glass object caused a collagenous capsule to be formed around it, in the well known \"foreign body reaction.\" He found that a filament of tissue formed in the center of the tube, connecting the two ends of the capsule. The isolated tissue of the filament quickly underwent the degenerative changes seen in aged connective tissues, but if he periodically removed the fluid around it, and allowed fresh lymph fluid to fill the capsule, the filament retained a youthful elasticity, even as the rat aged. Isolation from the organism caused age-like degeneration to develop rapidly. When the organism can't remove a foreign object, the collagenous capsule that encloses it has a high probability of forming a cancer. This \"foreign body carcinogenesis\" has been studied for many years.Foreign body carcinogenesis is closely related to chemical carcinogenesis, radiation carcinogenesis, and hormonal carcinogenesis. Chemical carcinogens such as methylcholanthrene are irritating when injected, and stimulate collagen production. Neither type of carcinogenesis is always effective, because this collagen reaction can be protective, by isolating the irritant toxin (Zhang, et al., 2013). Radiation stimulates the secretion of collagen, and causes cross-linking that makes it stiffer, and slows its removal, leading to its accumulation (Sassi, et al., 2001). Some types of cross-linking block the ability of macrophages to remove it, creating something like a diffuse foreign body reaction. Estrogen, for example in the process of causing breast cancer, causes increased collagen synthesis. This is widely recognized, in the association of \"breast density\" (a high collagen content) with the risk of cancer. Estrogen also causes the formation of the enzymes that cross-link and stiffen the collagen, lysyl oxidase and transglutaminase(Sanada, et al., 1978; Campisi, et al., 2008; Balestrieri, et al., 2012).Although ultraviolet and ionizing radiation can act directly on collagen, to stiffen it, the greatest effect of the radiation is probably by reaction with relatively unstable components of tissues, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, which then react with the collagen, cross-linking it (Igarashi, et al., 1989). Even in the absence of radiation, a deficiency of vitamin E accelerates the spontaneous decomposition of the unsaturated fats, accelerating the aging of collagen (Sundholm and Visapää, 1978 ). Many observations suggest that all of the collagen-aging carcinogenic factors interact synergistically.When cells are placed on a glass slide coated with collagen, they move to parts of the collagen that have been cross-linked, and they move from slightly cross-linked collagen to stiffer, more thoroughly cross-linked areas (Vincent, et al., 2013). When they are on stiffer collagen, they pull themselves more tightly toward it, continuously expending energy in the process. The muscle-like contraction of the cell causes it to become more rigid (Huang and Ingber, 2005). The increased hardness of even small tumors makes it possible to identify lymph node metastases from a breast cancer by touch, without removing them (Miyaji, et al., 1997).The increased energy cost of this \"isotonic contraction\" of the cell filaments requires more energy to sustain, and will tend to create lactic acid, the way intense muscle contraction does, while consuming oxygen at a higher rate. The increased lactic acid and decreased oxygen availability stimulate the synthesis of more collagen, the growth of new blood vessels, expression of enzymes for increasing the stiffness of the collagen, and other processes associated with inflammation, aging, and cancer. Blocking even one of these processes, the lysyl oxidase cross-linking enzyme, can reduce the invasiveness of a cancer (Lee, et al., 2011). Some observations (Tan, et al., 2010) show that the circulating cells of metastatic cancer are more rigid than other cells, which would increase the likelihood that they will block capillaries, creating oxygen-deprived nests of collagen-secreting cells.One of the substances produced by stressed cells that's involved in tumor induction, growth, and metastasis (Tanaka, et al., 2003; Datta, et al., 2010; Was, et al., 2010) is the enzyme heme oxygenase, which breaks down the essential component of respiratory enzymes, heme, producing carbon monoxide as a product, which inhibits cell respiration, increasing reliance on the glycolysis which produces lactic acid. If metastatic cells continue to produce this enzyme, this is likely to contribute to reconstituting the \"cancer field,\" with increased HIF, hypoxia inducible factor, and a variety of other regulatory agents, each of which has its protective functions elsewhere, but which in combination can worsen the tumor.Substances that inhibit inflammation are likely to also inhibit excessive collagen synthesis, serotonin secretion, and the formation of estrogen. Besides aspirin, some effective substances are apigenin and naringenin, found in oranges and guavas. These flavonoids also inhibit the formation of nitric oxide and prostaglandins, which are important for inflammation and carcinogenesis (Liang, et al., 1999). Increased CO2, which has a variety of anti-inflammatory effects, can decrease collagen formation and tissue collagen content significantly (Ryu, et al., 2010).Deprivation of glucose and oxygen, which can be the local result of a cellular environment of condensed, stiffened collagen and the cellular tension and activation produced in response, combined with systemic stress that causes free fatty acids to interfere with the oxidation of sugar, activates enzymes that can dissolve collagen (MMP-2 and MMP-9). These enzymes are involved in metastasis, allowing cells to escape from the condensed collagen, but although they are normally thought of as enzymes that act outside of cells, they can also enter the cell's nucleus, where they degrade the DNA, causing the mutations and chromosomal abnormalities that are so characteristic of cancer (Hill, et al., 2012). Like glucose deprivation, exposure to 2-deoxyglucose, often used in tumor imaging, promotes metastasis (Schlappack, et al., 1991).The fact that cancer cells are stressed and damaged, and accumulate DNA damage, means that in a typical tumor there is a high rate of cell death. The number of apoptotic (disintegrating) cells in a tumor corresponds to the aggressiveness of the tumor (Vakkala, et al, 1999). In the 1940s and 1950s, Polezhaev demonstrated that dying cells stimulate cell renewal, and this is true in young and healthy organs, as well as in tumors.In 36% of women who had had a breast removed, from 7 to 22 years previously, identifiable (by the same tests used to diagnose breast cancer) cancer cells could be found circulating in their blood stream (Meng, et al., 2004). Tissue biopsies would be able to find the sources of those circulating cells, nests of similar cells throughout the body, which were dying about as fast as they were replicating. In 1969, Harry Rubin described an autopsy study which found that everyone over the age of 50 had at least one diagnosable cancer in some tissue. \"Occult microscopic cancers are exceedingly common in the general population and are held in a dormant state by a balance between cell proliferation and cell death and also an intact host immune surveillance\"(Goldstein and Mascitelli, 2011). These authors observed that the stress of surgery stimulates tumor growth, by various mechanisms, and that surgery increases the risk of developing cancer in apparently cancer-free patients.In 1956, Hardin Jones wrote \"If one has cancer and opts to do nothing at all, he will live longer and feel better than if he undergoes radiation, chemotherapy or surgery, other than when used in immediate life-threatening situations.\" In the 1990s, a group of cancer specialists were asked what they would do if they were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and most of them said they would do nothing.The radical mastectomy, which removed massive amounts of apparently normal tissue as well as the breast tumor, was practiced for hundreds of years, and was the standard treatment for breast cancer until the 1980s, after G.W. Crile, Jr., had publicized the evidence showing that simply removing the tumor lump itself didn't cause a higher mortality rate, and that the surgery produced much less disability.Although the lumpectomy was eventually accepted by the profession, the evidence that the long term survival rate was higher when the surgery was done during the luteal phase in premenopausal women has been generally ignored, because the cancer ideology maintains that the fate of the cancer is in the cells, rather than in the patient's hormone balance.Because of the continual indoctrination about the importance of \"early diagnosis to increase the chance of a cure,\" and the widely publicized \"cure rates,\" it's easy for doctors to rush people into treatment, before they have time to study the issue. Dean Burk, who was a collaborator of Otto Warburg's for many years, was quoted in regard to the claims of the American Cancer Society that \"They lie like scoundrels.\"In the 1970s, I noticed that the definitions of the features of uterine cancer had been changed recently, including as \"cancer\" things that had previously been classified as merely abnormal or precancerous.  Reading more about the grading of cancer, I saw that other cancers had been defined more inclusively since the 1940s. Things that had previously not been called cancer were now being counted among the cancers that were cured by the various treatments, so, necessarily, the rate of cure had increased. The true situation could be seen by the age-specific mortality rate for each type of cancer. During the period when the \"cure rates\" were increasing, the age-specific death rates had increased. I think that's the sort of thing that Dean Burk had in mind.Nearly all of the studies of \"cure rates\" are comparisons of one ideologically-based and lucrative treatment against another ideologically-based and more or less lucrative treatment. When the cure rate, for example for breast cancer surgery, varies with the amount of progesterone in the body, there is very little interest in investigating the processes involved, because lucrative products aren't involved.When abnormal \"metastatic\" cells circulate in the blood or lymph, most of them die spontaneously when they stick in a place that doesn't support their growth. Many of the nests of cells that have started to grow probably regress spontaneously when conditions in the body change. Even large, clearly diagnosed tumors occasionally regress spontaneously. Aging and sickness tend to support the vicious cycles that lead to the progressive deterioration of the collagenous matrix. Stress (even anxiety-induced hyperventilation) produces alkalosis, and alkalosis favors increased collagen synthesis, while lower pH inhibits it (Frick, et al., 1997). For example, within a minute or two of hyperventilating, platelets release serotonin, and serotonin is a major promoter of collagen synthesis and fibrosis.The vicious cycles that promote cancer can be interrupted to some extent simply by reducing exposure to things that promote stress and inflammation--endotoxin, polyunsaturated fats, amino acid imbalance, nutritional deficiencies, ionizing radiation, estrogens--and maintaining optimal levels of things that protect against those--carbon dioxide, vitamin E, progesterone, light, aspirin, sugars, and thyroid hormone, for example.REFERENCESJ Cell Physiol. 2012 Apr;227(4):1577-82. Interplay between membrane lipid peroxidation, transglutaminase activity, and cyclooxygenase 2 expression in the tissue adjoining to breast cancer.Balestrieri ML, Dicitore A, Benevento R, Di Maio M, Santoriello A, Canonico S, Giordano A, Stiuso P.J Neurosci Res. 2008 May 1;86(6):1297-305. Effect of growth factors and steroids on transglutaminase activity and expression in primary astroglial cell cultures. Campisi A, Bramanti V, Caccamo D, Li Volti G, Cannavò G, Currò M, Raciti G, Galvano F, Amenta F, Vanella A, Ientile R, Avola R.J Biol Chem. 2010 Nov 19;285(47):36842-8.  CXCR3-B can mediate growth-inhibitory signals in human renal cancer cells by down-regulating the expression of heme oxygenase-1. Datta D, Banerjee P, Gasser M, Waaga-Gasser AM, Pal S.Genet Res. 1982 Jun;39(3):237-59. Non-random X-chromosome inactivation in the mouse: difference of reaction to imprinting. Falconer DS, Isaacson JH, Gauld IK.Am J Physiol. 1997 May;272(5 Pt 1):C1450-6. Acute metabolic acidosis inhibits the induction of osteoblastic egr-1 and type 1 collagen. Frick KK, Jiang L, Bushinsky DA.QJM (2011) 104 (9): 811-815. Surgery and cancer promotion: are we trading beauty for cancer?Goldstein MR and Mascitelli L.Biochim Biophys Acta. 2005 Sep 25;1756(1):1-24. The role of pH dynamics and the Na+/H+ antiporter in the etiopathogenesis and treatment of cancer.

        "chunk_html": "Serotonin: Effects in disease, aging and inflammationInterpreting medical publications requires some skills that aren't needed for understanding more strictly scientific reports, because medical writing often takes into account the fact that physicians spend most of their time interacting with the public, rather than studying. The public's understanding of medicine is shaped by \"public relations,\" by the introduction of words and concepts that frame the argument. (The linguist George Lakoff summarized the essence of public relations by observing that people reject facts that are outside their view of reality, their mental framework.) Television and public schools now frame the worldview of the affluent cultures, according to the needs of the ruling powers. Long before specific prescription drugs could be advertised directly to consumers, the medical and pharmaceutical industries were creating a favorable frame for their products.Many years ago, public relations experts used expensive opinion polls to judge the effectiveness of their efforts, but now there is a convenient way to see how the general public is thinking: Wikipedia, the internet encyclopedia. The success of corporate advertising can be seen in their recent article on serotonin, which says \"It is a well-known contributor to feelings of well-being; therefore it is also known as a 'happiness hormone' despite not being a hormone.\"The culture that has happy and unhappy hormones was a culture in which each hormone had a receptor, a substance in a cell which, when its ligand was bound to it, made the cell do something. Although that culture still has influence in the 21st century, discoveries made between 1940 and 1970 showed that those mechanical ideas of receptors didn't reflect biological reality. Albert Szent-Gyorgi and the Pullmans showed that the electronic qualities of molecules determined their functions, and Szent-Gyorgyi showed that the state of the cell, tissue, and organism governed the effect of hormones and drugs. In the 1960s, substances with very different biological effects, such as acetylcholine and adrenaline, were shown to be selectively bound to the same cellular site in some cells. It was primarily the drug industry that created and sustained the specific receptor doctrine. That doctrine suited the recognition of their public relations- marketing experts, that successful advertising had to be directed at the sixth-grade educational level. The ideas of bioelectronics and context-sensitive molecules, like morphogenetic fields, were just too complicated to sell well.Although metaphorical thinking can be creative and productive, metaphors mustn't be taken literally. The identification of multiple types of receptor for a given natural substance involves the use of different substances as metaphors or similes for the natural substance. That type of pharmacology is slowly being replaced by an attempt to understand state-dependent sensitivities. The energetic state of a cell, and of the whole organism, determines the meaning of events and conditions, such as the presence of the \"regulatory substances.\"The receptor culture can be tentatively disregarded when thinking about the history of serotonin. In the 1930s Vittorio Erspamer identified an amine in the intestine, that caused the intestine to contract. Then a group in England extracted an amine from serum that caused blood vessels to contract, and identified its chemical nature. Later, Erspamer showed that the intestinal amine and the vascular amine were chemically the same. The English group who had identified the substance by extracting tons of beef blood, wanted to find sensitive ways to assay it for further studies, and in 1951 they gave a sample to a pharmacologist, John Gaddum, who tested its effects on tissues including blood vessels and rat uteruses.Gaddum tested the serotonin in combination with a variety of other drugs, including ergot derivatives, that he knew acted on smooth muscles, and very soon observed that LSD blocked the effects of serotonin. Since he knew that LSD produced mental effects (Sandoz had distributed samples of it to researchers in 1947), he reasoned that the brain might also contain serotonin, and by 1952 was able to demonstrate that it does contain small amounts of it. A couple of years later he suggested \"that the mental effects of lysergic acid diethylamide are due to interference with the normal action of this HT [5- hydroxytryptamine, serotonin].\" At the Rockefeller Institute in New York, Woolley and Shaw also saw the antagonistic effects on smooth muscle, and drew similar conclusions about the brain. Erspamer (Renic. sc. farmital. 1, 1, 1954) showed that LSD was a highly effective antagonist against the antidiuresis caused by serotonin (enteramine).Around the same time, in the early 1950s, several people recognized that the symptoms produced by administering an excess of serotonin were similar to those experienced by people with intestinal tumors called argentaffinomas or carcinoid tumors, which are usually in the small intestine or appendix. The normal intestine contains about 95% of the serotonin in the body (and the brain normally contains only about 1%), and in the normal person only about 1% of the dietary tryptophan is converted to serotonin. But in an advanced case of carcinoid, 60% of the tryptophan can be turned into serotonin. Especially if the tumor has invaded the liver, the serotonin won't be destroyed by the liver in the usual way, and will circulate in the bloodstream at high levels, producing symptoms of flushing, sweating (sometimes dark-colored), diarrhea (serotonin stimulates small intestine smooth muscle, but inhibits the large [Bennett & Whitney, 1966]), nausea, anxiety, reduced urination, muscle and joint pains, and, in late stages, very often cardiovascular disease (especially inflammation, fibroma and calcification of the valves in the right side of the heart) and aggressive behavior (Russo, et al., 2004) and psychosis.Testing Gaddum's idea of antagonism between LSD and serotonin in humans, Montanari and Tonini found that intramuscular injections of serotonin antagonized the psychological effects of LSD. Other drugs, especially other ergot derivatives, were more successful than LSD in blocking the effects of serotonin (Dubach and Gsell, 1962). There have been suggestions that pregnancy hormones could control serotonin excess (McCullough and Myers, 1965). Since estrogen promotes serotonin, progesterone is likely to be the protective factor (Donner & Handa, 2009; Hiroi, et al., 2006; Berman, et al., 2006; Bethea, et al., 2000).More recently (Spigset, et al., 2004), it was found that LSD binding to a presumed serotonin receptor was low in carcinoid patients, supporting the idea of antagonism between the substances, but in the older studies symptoms, rather than competition for binding to certain proteins, were the focus of attention. The effects produced by injections and oral doses of synthetic serotonin, and of substances that block the synthesis of serotonin, were studied in both animals and humans. When a symptom such as clotting, flushing, or diarrhea is produced by serotonin itself, or prevented by a blocker of serotonin synthesis, \"receptors\" aren't an issue.Aldous Huxley was one of the first people to think about the general biological meaning of drugs such as LSD. Referring to the ideas of Henri Bergson and William Blake, he suggested that the brain usually acts as a filter, or \"reducing valve,\" to make us disregard most of the information we are receiving through our senses, and that the psychedelic drugs temporarily remove the filter, or open the sensory reducing valve. Bergson had suggested that the filter was a practical measure needed to allow us to focus on practical survival needs; Blake had suggested that the doors of perception were kept closed for cultural reasons.Some recent reviews have discussed the evidence supporting the serotonin system as primarily inhibitory and protective (Anne Frederickson, 1998, Neil Goodman, 2002). Goodman describes the serotonergic system as one of our \"diffuse neuroregulatory systems,\" and suggests that drugs such as LSD weaken its inhibitory, filtering effect. (Jacobs, 1983, 1987: by changes in the effects of serotonin in the brain, produced by things that affect its synthesis, release, catabolism, or receptor action.) LSD depresses the rate of firing of serotonergic nerves in the raphe nuclei (Trulson and Jacobs, 1979) causing arousal similar to stimulation of the reticular formation, as if by facilitating sensory input into the reticular formation (Bowman and Rand, 1980).In European culture, some people--e.g., Plato, Descarte, Locke, Eccles, probably even B.F. Skinner--have believed that mind and body are essentially different things (analogous to computer hardware and its programs), while another tradition--Blake, Lamarck, Darwin, C.L. Morgan, Pavlov, Reich, C.R. Cloninger, for example--has emphasized the continuity of consciousness and character with the body.Understanding the authoritarian personality has been an important issue in the 20th century. Wilhelm Reich used some old ideas about the nervous system that were current near the beginning of the century, and Cloninger (1995) and others (Netter, et al., 1996, Ruegg, et al., 1997, Gerra, 2000), toward the end of the century, were able to incorporate the newer information about the serotonergic-dopaminergic antagonisms. In this newer view, high serotonin production causes behavioral inhibition and harm avoidance, which are traits of the authoritarian personality, while anti-authorians tend to have \"novelty seeking\" personalities, with high dopamine and low serotonin functions.In the 1960s, experimenters put electrodes into a chicken's optic nerve, and when the chicken saw a checkerboard pattern, they could measure a patterned electrical activity in the nerve. Without the light stimulating the retina, the nerve was quiet. But when they gave the chicken LSD or similar chemicals, they recorded patterned electrical activity in the nerve, in the absence of external stimulation. Around the same time, other experimenters showed that retinal fatigue quickly desensitized the retina, preventing the transmission of impulses to the brain, except when the light pattern corresponded to something familiar, showing that impulses from the brain are always involved in renewing, in patterned ways, the sensitivity of the retina.The latter experiment shows that everyone's perception involves an outward-directed activity of the brain, and the experiments using the chemical stimulants suggested that the intensity of the outward- directed action can vary.The inhibitory serotonergic \"harm avoidance\" system, and the opposing excitatory activating \"novelty seeking\" systems are constantly being influenced by many factors, including nutrition, hormones, environmental challenges and opportunities, social interactions, seasons, and the rhythm of night and day alternation.Several kinds of research are now showing that the effects of the environment on the serotonergic system and its antagonists can influence every aspect of health, not just the personality.For example, there have been suggestions that early life isolation of an animal can affect its serotonergic activity and increase its anxiety, aggression, or susceptibility to stress (Malick and Barnett, 1976, Malick, 1979, dos Santos, et al, 2010), and these effects are associated with increased risk of becoming depressed, and developing organic problems. Animals kept in darkness (or with blurring lenses) become nearsighted, as the eyeball grows longer under the influence of increased serotonin, and the eyes are protected against myopia by serotonin antagonists (George, et al., 2005). The incidence of myopia is increasing, at least in countries with industrialized economies, and is more common in females.Migraine headaches are also increasing in incidence. By the end of the 1950s, it was widely accepted that migraine headaches and associated symptoms including nausea and visual disturbances were caused by an excess of serotonin, and antiserotonin drugs of various types were being used for treatment. In one of the early studies of the use of LSD in psychotherapy, some of the patients noticed that their chronic headaches had stopped. Cluster headaches have also responded well to LSD and similar drugs (Sewell, et al., 2006).Women have migraines more often than men do, and they tend to occur in association with ovulation or menstruation. Estrogen inhibits monoamino oxidase, MAO, especially the A form that is most active in detoxifying serotonin, and it increases the enzymes that control the rate of serotonin synthesis. During serotonin excess, the veins and capillaries of the pia mater are engorged with blood, while circulation to the brain generally is depressed. Visual symptoms are probably produced by contriction of arterioles, while the pain is associated with engorged veins. Progesterone activates the MAO-A, and has other antiserotonin effects on blood vessels and nerves.Recently (Shansky, et al., 2010; Figueiredo, et al., 2007), females have been found to be more susceptible to stress, and to have reduced uptake of serotonin (prolonging its effects), which increases glucocorticoids and ACTH. Kendler, et al. (2005) have found that people with reduced serotonin uptake are more susceptible to stress-induced depression.The increase of inhibitory serotonin with stress and depression is probably biologically related to the role of serotonin in hibernation, which is an extreme example of \"harm avoidance\" by withdrawal. A diet high in polyunsaturated fat increases the tendency to go into hibernation, probably by increasing the brain's uptake of tryptophan. When this is combined with an increasingly cold environment, the form of MAO that removes serotonin decreases its activity, while the form that removes norepinephrine increases its activity. The metabolite of serotonin, 5-HIAA, decreases, as the effect of serotonin increases.In experiments to investigate the mechanism of hibernation, animals were injected with serotonin, at different environmental temperatures. In a cool environment, the serotonin caused their temperature to fall, by decreasing their heat production, and increasing their loss of heat (by causing vasodilation in the skin, \"flushing\"). In a hot environment, serotonin can cause the animal's temperature to rise.Serotonin can reduce the production of energy by inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory enzymes (Medvedev, 1990, 1991), and by reduction of oxygen delivery to tissues by vasoconstriction. It also appears to interfere with the use of glucose (de Leiva, et al., 1978, Moore, et al., 2004).The brains of people with Alzheimer's disease have a decreased ability to metabolize glucose, and high cortisol contributes to the altered glucose metabolism, and to the destruction of nerve cells. People with Cloninger's \"harm avoidance\" personality trait, which is closely associated with serotonin (Hansenne, et al., 1999), are more likely to develop dementia (Clément, et al., 2010). These observations are consistent with the stress-susceptibility of people with high serotonin exposure, and to the effects of cortisol on nerves and glucose-derived energy production.Researchers in Brasil have suggested that the serotonergic system facilitates conditioned fear, while inhibiting the fight or flight reaction, and that this can protectively limit the stress response (Graeff, et al., 1996). \"5HT systems reduce the impact of impending or actual aversive events. Anticipation of an aversive event is associated with anxiety and this motivates avoidance behaviour\" (Deakin, 1990). In a stressful situation, the serotonergic nerves can prevent ulcers. In other contexts, though, increased serotonin can cause ulcers.The protective, defensive reactions involving serotonin's blocking of certain types of reaction to ordinary stresses, are similar to the effects of serotonin in hibernation and in Alzheimer's disease (Mamelak, 1997; Heininger, 2000; Perry, et al., 2002). In those extreme conditions, serotonin reduces energy expenditure, eliminating all brain functions except those needed for simple survival. These parallels suggest that improving energy production, for example by providing ketones as an alternative energy source, while reducing the stress hormones, might be able to replace the defensive reactions with restorative adaptive nerve processes, preventing or reversing Alzheimer's disease.One of the factors promoting excess cortisol production is intestinal irritation, causing absorption of endotoxin and serotonin. Fermentable fibers (including pectins and fructooligosaccharides) support the formation of bacterial toxins, and can cause animals to become anxious and aggressive. Fed to horses, some types of fiber increase the amount of serotonin circulating in the blood. Grains, beans, and other seeds contain fermentable fibers that can promote intestinal irritation.The liver has several ways to detoxify endotoxin and serotonin, but these can fail as a result of poor nutrition and hypothyroidism.The lung can bind and destroy any excess serotonin that reaches it. A lack of carbon dioxide makes platelets release their stored serotonin, and it probably has the same effect in the lung endothelial cells. Without being able to bind the serotonin, the enzyme (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) would be unable to destroy it.An excess of tryptophan in the diet, especially with deficiencies of other nutrients, can combine with inflammation to increase serotonin. Polyunsaturated fatty acids promote the absorption of tryptophan by the brain, and its conversion to serotonin. (A \"deficiency\" of polyunsaturated fat decreases the expression of the enzyme that synthesizes serotonin [McNamara, et al., 2009).Some fruits, including bananas, pineapples, and tomatoes, contain enough serotonin to produce physiological effects in susceptible people.Besides avoiding foods containing fermentable fibers and starches that resist quick digestion, eating fibrous foods that contain antibacterial chemicals, such as bamboo shoots or raw carrots, helps to reduce endotoxin and serotonin. Activated charcoal can absorb many toxins, including bacterial endotoxin, so it is likely to reduce serotonin absorption from the intestine. Since it can also bind or destroy vitamins, it should be used only intermittently. Frolkis, et al. (1989, 1984) found that it extended median and average lifespan of rats, beginning in old age (28 months) by 43% and 34%, respectively, when given in large quantities (equivalent to about a cup per day for humans) for ten days of each month.The amino acid theanine, found in tea, has been reported to decrease the amount of serotonin in the brain, probably by decreasing its synthesis and increasing its degradation.This seems to be the opposite of the processes in hibernation. Progesterone, thyroid, and niacinamide (not nicotinic acid or inositol hexanicotinate) are other safe substances that help to reduce serotonin formation, and/or accelerate its elimination. (Niacinamide seems to increase serotonin uptake.)To provide usable energy to the over-stressed brain (and heart), R.L. Veech has advocated the use of ketones, but the pure chemicals are expensive to make. An easily available and inexpensive source of ketones (in the form of ketoacids, which can be converted to amino acids if they aren't needed for energy) is the juice extracted (with a centrifugal juicer) from raw potatoes, which also contains proteins and other nutrients. The juice can be scrambled like eggs, and is usually tolerated even by very debilitated people.Hypothyroidism is a very common cause of increased serotonin (e.g., Henley, et al., 1998), and if the thyroid hormone is supplemented until symptoms are resolved, it's likely that the serotonin will have been normalized.REFERENCESVet Rec. 2010 Jan 30;166(5):133-6.

        "chunk_html": "Cataracts: water, energy, light, and agingBecause of the baby boom population bulge, the market for cataract surgery and the little plastic intraocular lenses is growing wonderfully. According to the World Health Organization, there were about 20 million cataract surgeries performed in 2010, with 32 million expected in 2020. In the US, about 3 million cataract surgeries are performed annually. Revenue from sale of the intraocular lenses in the US alone was $775,000,000 in 2010, and is expected to reach $965,000,000 by 2017. In 2010, the Alcon company earned $1,200,000,000 from one type of intraocular lens. (Market Research.com) To promote the sale of the \"premium'\" lenses, which cost thousands of dollars, patients are told that the more expensive lenses will save them money in the long run, by making ordinary glasses unnecessary (sometimes).The lens replacement surgery is now sometimes recommended when a cataract has caused only a slight decrease in visual acuity, or even a suspected decrease in acuity. I haven't known anyone who had the surgery who had been informed of the incidence of complications of the surgery, which result in permanent blindness for thousands of the patients every year.Some of the causes of cataracts have been known for many years, but the knowledge is usually ignored by the medical profession. Medical myths about the causes of disease support present practices. Myths about the causes of cancer, heart failure, hypertension, menopause, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, depression, dementia, and cataracts are designed to reinforce each other, forming an interlocking system, an ideology of the organism.The conventional ideology identifies pathological cells and defective proteins and bad genes as the causes of organ failure and disease, and \"aging\" is seen as a dimension in which entropy tends to increase those defects.This ideology discourages thoughts of \"field\" effects in which the function of a molecule, a cell, or an organ affects, and is affected by, things that aren't in direct contact with it. This is why the removal of a lens is treated so casually. There is some knowledge about the effects of systemic disease on the eye, but very little about the effects of particular parts of the eye on systemic physiology, and relatively few physicians are aware of the effects of one part of the eye on the other parts of the eye. A few of these physiological interactions within the eye are very interesting. For example, injury to the lens powerfully stimulates regeneration of nerves in the retina (Fischer, et al., 2000). Things which injure the lens enough to cause cataracts to develop might also be injuring the retina, but the emission of stimulating substances from the lens must be a compensating influence.Every normal tissue of the eye is emitting substances that affect other parts of the eye, and probably other parts of the body. Until the 1970s, the literature was dominated by the view that the lens was a lifeless material, like hair and toenails, and even in 2013 there is great reluctance of researchers to recognize its vital cellular activity.After an artificial lens has been implanted, there are great changes in the vitreous humor (which fills the space between the retina and the lens), with a reversal of the gradient of viscosity, and with changes in many proteins, including transthyretin, alpha antitrypsin, retinoic acid binding protein, antioxidant proteins, and the enzymes carbonic anhydrase and triosephosphate isomererase (Neal, et al., 2005).I haven't seen any recent studies of the effects of lens removal on the nervous system, but a 1953 study of 21 patients reported a high percentage of behavioral disturbances following the surgery: \"Following the operation 20 patients showed some alteration in behavior including changes in mood, psychomotor disturbances, paranoid and somatic delusions, hallucinations, disorientation and confabulations. In 3 cases the disturbance was characterized as severe.\" \"It is concluded that disturbed behavior is an integral part of the reaction of almost all cataract patients because of a complex interaction of a number of factors\" (Linn, et al., 1953).In animal studies, when the lens capsule is closed after removal of the lens, within a few weeks a well formed lens has regenerated (Gwon, et al., 1993); cell division is stimulated in the cells remaining attached to the capsule, similar to the regeneration of the adrenal cortex after its removal.Artificial replacement lenses are designed (with an ultrasharp edge) to block the regenerative migration of cells within the capsule, because the cells can quickly form a new cataract behind the plastic lens; those cataracts commonly form in reaction to the lens. The use of arsenic to kill these cells has been proposed, and probably used (Zhang, et al., 2010).The easy money in lens surgery has obviously discouraged professional interest in preventing cataracts, or curing them, or stimulating the regeneration of new lenses. Research in the prevention of cataracts has encountered serious barriers to performing the clinical trials that would be necessary for approval.   \"… Clinicians have even developed the opinion that lens and cataract research is no longer necessary to overcome cataract blindness.\" (Sasaki, et al., 2000.) However, it isn't inconceivable that someone could find a way to make prevention, cure, or regeneration significantly remunerative.Although the lens has no blood supply, fluid carrying nutrients and oxygen is constantly flowing through it, providing the cells with glucose, amino acids, and ATP, that it uses for maintaining its structure. Its proteins are being renewed continually, broken down and synthesized (Ozaki, et al., 1985). There is clear evidence that some of the core cells retain a nucleus, and that large molecules can move between cells (Lieska, et al., 1992; Shestopalov and Bassnett, 2000; Stewart, 2008; Mathias and Rae, 2004). Despite this evidence, prominent researchers are still promoting the paradigm of inertness, the lens as analogous to a toenail. As in other cells, ATP maintains the proper water content in the cells. Besides providing energy and amino acids, the circulating fluid carries minerals and many hormones and regulatory substances.The absence of a blood supply to the lens has kept people from thinking of its pathology in terms of the inflammatory processes that are now recognized in other conditions, for example in dementia, heart disease, and cancer, but the same basic processes can be seen in the development of cataracts. Improved knowledge of lens physiology is very likely to lead to major improvements in therapies for the other conditions. In the lens, the state of water changes before there is any other evidence that a cataract is developing (Mori, 1993); detecting similar water changes in other tissues might improve diagnosis and treatment of other problems. Things that acutely lower the ATP content of cells increase their water content, and in the process, the water functions differently, becoming more randomly arranged.The idea that the properties of water change as cell functions change contradicts the common reductionist assumption that water is just the medium in which molecular interactions occur. Since Kelvin's 1858 demonstration that the heat capacity of water changes with its shape, and Drost-Hansen's demonstrations that its density decreases near surfaces, attention to the physical properties of water has made it possible to understand many biological mysteries, such as the decrease of volume (Abbott and Baskin, 1962) when a nerve or muscle cell is excited. Although the invention of the MRI grew directly from Damadian's understanding of water's centrality to biology's most important issues, the technology's most important contributions, related to changes in water structure, haven't been recognized, understood, or assimilated by medicine.The electrical properties of the protein framework of a cell interact with the state of the water in the cell, and with the things dissolved in the water, including phosphate, calcium, sodium, and potassium. Actin, one of the major muscle proteins, forms a meshwork in the cytoplasm of lens fiber cells, and myosin, the other major muscle protein, has been found in association with the actin (Al-Ghoul, et al., 2010). ATP (alternating with ADP+inorganic phosphate) is involved in muscle contraction and relaxation, and it is involved in the conversion of actin from a filament into a globular form. Changes in the amount of ATP and ADP are important for influencing the interactions of water and proteins.The actin skeleton is involved in the fiber cell's elongation as it develops from a roundish epithelial cell, and it's probably responsible for the ability of lens cells to contract when stimulated (Oppitz, et al., 2003; Andjelica, et al., 2011). These muscle-like effects of actin are believed to be responsible for the movement of organelles and other cell motion, such as cytoplasmic streaming. But, as a major part of the cell's structure, it could also be expected to act as the framework for electroosmotic flow of water, accounting for the circulation that maintains the cell's energy. The observed static electrical properties of lens cell fragments could account for a complete daily renewal of the fluid (Pasquale, et al., 1990), but the metabolic gradients in whole cells would probably cause faster flow.With oxidative energy production occurring in the surface cells, an electrical gradient will be created, causing water to flow away from the site of respiration. (Electroosmosis probably also accounts for the somewhat mysterious exit of water from the eyeball and brain, in perivascular flow.) The flow of water through these cells is very fast, but Ichiji Tasaki has demonstrated similarly fast movement of water in nerves and artificial polymers in association with electrical activity (2002; Tasaki and Iwasa, 1981, 1982; Iwasa, et al., 1980).At least since Gullstrand's unfounded assertions in his 1911 Nobel lecture, it has been assumed that the lens, like a water-filled balloon, keeps the same volume when it flattens, for distant focus. Zamudio, et al. (2008), have shown that \"…the lens volume decreases as the lens flattens during unaccommodation.\" \"The lens volume always decreases as the lens flattens.\" They determined that \"…the changes in lens volume, as reflected by the speed of the equatorial diameter recovery inin vitrocow and rabbit lenses during simulated accommodation, occurred within a physiologically relevant time frame (200 ms), implying a rapid movement of fluid to and from the lens during accommodation.\" This is the duration of the action potential of healthy heart muscle, though it's probably not as fast as the very superficial changes that Tasaki saw in nerves. It's the sort of change rate that could be expected in an organ whose change of shape is the result of stimulation. Accommodation, with this immediate hydration, is produced by cholinergic stimulation, and in the healthy lens this hydration is rapidly reversible, as the stimulating acetylcholine disappears and the lens flattens.The failing heart muscle, unable to relax fully, becomes harder as its water content increases, and cancer cells, locked into a contracted excited state, become stiffer as their water content increases. Similarly, cataracts have been described as more rigid than normal lens tissue (Heys and Truscott, 2008; Hu, et al., 2000), yet their water content is higher (Racz, et al., 2000). Along with the increased water, the stressed cells take up very large amounts of calcium, and sodium increases while potassium decreases. Inorganic phosphate increases in the stressed cells, some of it entering with the circulating fluid, but some of it produced from the ATP which is decreasing. Serotonin, iron, lipid peroxidation products, nitric oxide, and prostaglandin are also increased. The increased calcium activates proteolytic enzymes that break down protein.In the failing heart and growing tumors, there is an increase in the quantity and the cross-linking of collagen in the extracellular matrix, contributing to the overall hardness, besides the contracted state of the cells themselves. In the cataract, cross-linking of various proteins, including collagen, also seems to be involved in the problem, along with the altered state of the water (Mishra, et al., 1997; Eldred, et al., 2011). The cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase is induced by stressors such as ultraviolet light which produce cataracts.When the available energy doesn't meet the cell's energy requirements, if the cell isn't quickly killed by the stress it will use some adaptive mechanisms, stopping some repair processes to reduce energy expenditure, possibly stopping specialized functions to reduce energy needs. Fibrotic changes occur as a result of defensive reactions in stressed cells, usually following long periods of fatigue and inflammation. Cortisol generally protects cells by blocking over-stimulation and providing increased material for energy and repair, but it can kill cells (nerve cells and thymus cells) that depend on glucose oxidation, leading to immunodeficiency and excitotoxic brain damage. The glucose-dependent lens fiber cells express the same glucose transporters, GLUT1 and GLUT3, as the brain, and the \"nerve specific\" GLUT3 is concentrated in the dense nucleus of the lens (Donaldson, et al., 2003). Exposure to excessive cortisol or hypoglycemia is able to quickly produce cataracts, showing the basic importance of glucose metabolism for lens health.Oxidative metabolism in the surface cells is probably largely responsible for the streaming of fluid through the fiber cells, providing some ATP and the nutrients that allow the fiber cells to maintain and repair their structure, but I suspect that local metabolism of glucose by the fiber cells provides most of the energy for keeping the protein-water system in its orderly relaxed state.The aging lens, like all normal tissues, is drier, has a lower water content, than younger tissues, but when a cataract begins to develop, there is a sharp increase in the water content in that area, something that happens in any excited or fatigued tissue. (In a stimulated nerve or muscle, for example, although in a closed system there would be a slight decrease in volume as its water becomes relatively randomized, there is normally a sudden absorption of water from the extracellular space, where the water has the same random organization.) With the decreasing energy charge of the cell, represented by decreasing ATP and increasing ADP and inorganic phosphate, the long range order of the water decreases, changing the activity of enzymes in a variety of ways, for example by the exchange of a high magnesium content for a high calcium content. While the renewal of proteins decreases because of an energy deficit, the activation of proteolytic enzymes by calcium degrades the cell architecture and the crystallin that makes up about 90% of the cell's protein, and these damaged proteins become progressively cross-linked, in a process analogous to the cross-linking of collagen in sun-damaged skin, or in cancer or a fibrotic failing heart.The diffusion of water in these congested cataract areas becomes random, more like ordinary bulk water, and it's likely that this randomization of the water, along with the architectural disorganization of proteins and changing electrical fields, impedes the longitudinal flow of nourishing fluid through the lens. MRI studies show relatively free diffusion of water longitudinally in the lens fiber cells from front to back, but not transversely (Moffat and Pope, 2002). Water that's highly ordered by nearby surfaces can still be very mobile parallel to the surface.The parasympathetic nerve transmitter acetylcholine is formed in the lens, as well as its receptor and the enzyme which destroys it, cholinesterase. Chemicals that inhibit cholinesterase, and drugs that mimic the action of acetylcholine on the receptor, cause cataracts. These drugs (Michon and Kinoshita, 1968; Harkonen and Tarkkanen, 1976) cause the lens to take up water, sodium, and calcium, and to lose potassium, and by increasing the cells' energy expenditure, they accelerate the consumption of glucose while blocking other metabolism. Since these are known effects of stimulation by acetylcholine, it's reasonable to assume that acetylcholine is involved in the natural formation of cataracts.Besides the direct excitatory effects of acetylcholine, the increase of intracellular calcium and decrease of magnesium (Agarwal, et al., 2012) caused by it promote the synthesis of nitric oxide (which, for example, blocks the function of cytochrome oxidase, reducing the production of ATP), and the interference with glucose metabolism in itself is cataractogenic (Greiner, et al., 1981).Ultraviolet light powerfully stimulates the formation of nitric oxide (Chaudhry, et al., 1993), and is one of the known causes of cataracts. Since the cornea is more directly exposed than the lens to the ultraviolet rays of sunlight, the effects of injury can be seen more quickly. Exposure of the cornea to ultraviolet light causes swelling, reduced transparency, and the formation of nitric oxide, which enters the aqueous humor (Cejka, et al., 2012; Cejkova, et al., 2005). Swelling in itself, regardless of the cause, decreases the transparency of the cornea (Stevenson, et al., 1983); anything interfering with its energy metabolism causes swelling.The blue color of ordinary water is caused by its absorption of red light, possibly by its hydrogen bonds (Braun and Smirnov, 1993), but there haven't been many studies of the physical effects of red light on water itself. Since water absorbs much more strongly in the infrared wavelengths, there is a tendency to explain the benefits of sunlight by its infrared rays. Red and orange wavelengths penetrate tissue very effectively, because of their weaker absorption by water, allowing them to react with pigments in the cell, such as cytochrome oxidase, which is activated (or re-activated) by red light, increasing the production of ATP. This effect counteracts the toxic effects of ultraviolet light, but there are probably other mechanisms involved in the many beneficial effects of red light.Recent work by a group at the University of Ulm in Germany (Andrei Sommer, et al., 2011) has revealed an effect of red light (670 nm) on water that I think helps to explain some of its protective and restorative actions. Shining laser light onto layers of water adsorbed on a solid surface, they were able to show \"a breathing-like volume expansion of the topmost sheets of water molecules.\" They explain this as the result of a stabilization of a more ordered state of the hydrogen bonds of the water. They are applying this to chemotherapy, since the expansion of water in the cell where much of the water is in adsorbed layers similar to their experimental set-up, alternating with its volume contraction as the light is pulsed, causes water to move in and out of the cell quickly, taking some of the drug with it. They have also proposed that degenerative changes in the connective tissues involve a loss of ordered water, and have experimented with light treatments to restore elasticity and flexibility.Since the water in cataracts is in a less ordered state than in the transparent lens, the re-ordering effect of red light could be valuable, and if the effects are the same as in their experiments with cancer cells, the increased volume of the re-ordered water would cause a movement of water out of the cataract, as it does in cancer cells in their experiment. And the known restorative effect of red light on oxidative production of ATP would almost certainly be helpful.Among the popular medical treatments that are likely to contribute to the development of cataract are glucocorticoids, and drugs that increase serotonin (Dietze and Tilgner, 1973; Korsakova and Sergeeva, 2010), and drugs that increase nitric oxide. Free fatty acids are toxic to the lens, which contains the enzymes for synthesizing prostaglandins and related promoters of inflammation; the products of lipid peroxidation are increased in people with cataracts. Endotoxin from the intestine increases the formation of nitric oxide, so it's essential to minimize intestinal inflammation.High altitude very strongly protects against cataracts (Brilliant, et al., 1983). Low oxygen tension itself protects the lens's clarity (Akoyev, et al., 2009), possibly by the protective effect of increased carbon dioxide against glycation of protein amino groups. Aspirin's known anticataract effect apparently involves a similar protection of crystallin against glycation, but aspirin has several other protective effects, including prevention of protein cross-linking, and the inhibition of the synthesis of nitric oxide and prostaglandins and other disruptive materials (Crabbe, 1998; Beachy, et al., 1987; Lonchampt, et al., 1983). Progesterone's inhibition of nitric oxide production is probably protective for the lens, paralleling its effects in other organs. Inhibitors of nitric oxide, such as aminoguanidine, are protective. Anticholinergics, including atropine, inhibit over-hydration of the lens and prevent cataracts caused by excessive cholinergic stimulation (e.g., Kaufman, et al., 1977). Caffeine, in animal experiments, prevents cataracts. Uric acid, which inhibits nitric oxide formation, is reduced in people with cataracts. The factors that prevent or promote other degenerative diseases are similarly protective or harmful for the lens.REFERENCESJ Physiology 1962; 161, 379-391.

        "chunk_html": "Fatigue, aging, and recuperation===================================- Old people and sick people tire easily. Surprisingly, little is known to explain that common fact.- Myths about lactic acid and oxygen debt have misdirected most fatigue research.- The cellular processes involved in fatigue overlap with those of aging.- Knowledge about the mechanisms of fatigue should be useful in preventing some tissue swelling disorders, organ failure, degenerative calcification, and other energy-related problems.===================================GLOSSARY:* Uncoupling--In cellular respiration, oxidation of \"fuel\" in the mitochondrion is coupled to the phosphorylation of ADP, forming ATP. Uncouplers are chemicals that allow oxidation to proceed without producing the usual amount of ATP.* DNP--Dinitrophenol, an uncoupler that was once popular as a weight-loss drug.* NAD+ and NADH--Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and its reduced form are coenzymes for many oxidation and reduction reactions in cells.* Hyperammonemia--The presence of too much ammonia in the blood.* Vicinal water--water near surfaces, especially hydrophobic surfaces, that is physically and chemically different from ordinary water.* Hydrophobic--insoluble in water, a nonpolar oil-like molecule that repels water.===================================Unlike the somewhat technical medical concept of \"stress,\" the idea of fatigue is something everyone understands, to some extent. Hans Selye's studies of stress weren't widely accepted until about 40 years after their publication, but some of the main investigators of the fatigue phenomenon are still practically unknown in the universities, many years after they published their work.Several things have kept fatigue research from advancing, including the common feeling that fatigue is already sufficiently understood, and that it is somehow trivial, compared to problems such as growth, reproduction, and disease.Fatigue is usually described as decreased responsiveness resulting from over-exertion: For example, a muscle's decreased strength or speed of contraction, or a nerve's decreased speed of conduction, or a sense organ's decreased ability to detect or to discriminate. Another meaning of fatigue, a decreased resistance or strength, can be applied to materials, as well as to some biological functions, for example when fatigue leads to sickness or infections.\"Responsiveness\" implies sensitivity, and decreased sensitivity to stimulation can be seen in fatigued sense organs, nerves, muscles, and many other types of cell--immune cells, secretory cells, etc. Even plant cells have very similar processes of excitability that can be depleted by repetition.In a series of lectures to the Royal Society in England (1895-1901), the physicist Jagadis Chandra Bose described work that at first excited, and then disturbed, many physicists and biologists. He had invented devices for both producing and detecting electromagnetic waves, and he had been the first to produce millimeter length radio waves (microwaves). In Marconi's first transatlantic radio transmission Bose's signal detecting device was used. This device was based on the fact that two pieces of metal in superficial contact became electrically fused (cohered) in the presence of an electrical or electromagnetic field. After they cohered, a mechanical shock would separate them, breaking the electrical fusion.When Bose was experimenting with his \"self-restoring coherer,\" a semiconducting device that spontaneously broke the connection without being mechanically shaken, he observed that it became insensitive after prolonged use, that is, it lost its self-restoring capacity, but that after a rest, it recovered its sensitivity. He recognized the complex behavior of his instrument as being very similar to the electrical physiology of living cells.He then began a series of experiments on plants, animals, and minerals, that showed similar responses to all kinds of stimulation, including mechanical and thermal and electromagnetic.The idea of metal fatigue wasn't new, but Bose was able to think far beyond the ideas of the metallurgists. Biologists were thinking of electrical responsiveness as a defining feature of life, and Bose demonstrated that plants had electrical responsiveness very similar to that of animals, but also that similar reactions could be demonstrated in minerals.This was what disturbed the English scientists. Sensitivity, irritability, fatigue, and memory were supposed to be special properties related to life, and maybe to consciousness. For the Englishmen, there were religious implications in this Hindu's research.There were several reasons that European and American scientists couldn't accept the universal nature of the electrical properties that they were studying in animals. One of their motives was to see life as something immaterial, or of an absolutely different nature than inorganic matter. Another problem had to do with the developing belief that the special properties of life were enclosed in the hereditary substance of each cell, and that the electrical functions of cells were produced entirely by the presence of a membrane, surrounding a drop of water containing randomly moving dissolved chemicals.  For the membrane electricity theory, it was essential to believe in the random behavior of things dissolved in the cell water.So they considered the electrical-mechanical reactions and interactions of minerals to be so unlike the processes of life that it was inappropriate to see analogies between them. Minerals were composed of atoms, and, according to the doctrine of the time, they could have no \"physiological\" functions except on the atomic scale. It was more than 20 years before mainstream physicists began thinking about \"delocalized\" forces and fields in minerals.Between 1915 and 1934, Michael Polanyi made many observations that made it clear that the old kind of electrical atomism was completely unfounded. The behavior of mineral crystals, and the interactions between different phases of material, such as gas or liquid with a solid, could be understood only in terms of relatively long-range forces. Polanyi's experiments showed, for example, that events on the surface of a crystal modified the strength and deformability of the crystal.Many others between 1900 and 1940-- Lepeschkin, Nasonov, Bungenberg de Jong, and Solco Tromp, for example--argued that the sensitivity of protoplasm had to be understood in terms of long range order, something like a liquid crystalline state of matter that would require some of the kinds of knowledge of matter that were being developed by physicists, metallurgists, and a variety of others investigating the condensed states of matter.But the mainstream biologists preferred to describe cells in terms that would make impossible any of the responsivities or sensitivities seen in the \"simple\" solid state of minerals. To defend their ideology of the immateriality of life, they denied that the subtlest features of matter had anything to do with life, reducing life to a debased set of special, merely theoretical, mechanisms. The now defunct physical theory of merely localized atomic electrical forces became the paradigm for the new biology. The many demonstrations of coherent, ordered physical behavior of the cytoplasm, for example Gurwitch's mitogenic radiation, were dismissed with prejudice.During G. W. Crile's long career (1889-1941), understanding shock, biological energy, and fatigue were his main concerns. He believed that shock was the result of brain exhaustion, and in one of his last publications he showed that the brains from exhausted animals produced less bioluminescence than those from rested animals. His importance was in demonstrating that fatigue and shock are systemic conditions of the organism, rather than isolated events in muscles and nerves. Recent publications are showing the validity of this view. Crile's approach to the prevention and treatment of shock was based on isolating the damaged area with local anesthetics. Blocking the nerves from one injured part of the body, for example the sciatic nerve in the leg, could preserve energy production (and normal cell functions) throughout the rest of the body.About 30 years earlier (1901), Vvedensky had demonstrated that some types of fatigue appear to be a defensive blocking of responsiveness, such that intense stimulation would produce no response, while weak stimulation could sometimes produce a response. These changes affected cell functions in a variety of ways, that he called narcosis and parabiosis.There have been two popular ways to \"explain\" fatigue, one by saying that the cell's energy (usually thought of as ATP or glycogen) is used up, the other saying that the accumulation of a metabolic product (usually lactic acid) prevents further functioning. The obvious problem with these explanations is that the fatigue response is quite independent of those metabolic changes. Another problem is that those ideas don't explain the real changes that occur in cells that are demonstrating fatigue.Fatigued cells take up water, and become heavier. They also become more permeable, and leak. When more oxygen is made available, they are less resistant to fatigue, and when the organism is made slightly hypoxic, as at high altitude, muscles have more endurance, and are stronger, and nerves conduct more quickly. These facts don't fit with the standard model of the cell, in which its sensitivity is strictly governed by the behavior of its \"membrane.\" (For example, how can a membrane leak large molecules at the same time that it is intact and causing the cell to swell osmotically?) They are consistent with the model of the cell that treats protoplasm as a special phase of matter.Another feature of fatigue (and often of aging, stress, and sickness) is that the relaxation of muscles is retarded and impaired.Hypothyroidism causes muscle relaxation to be slowed, both in skeletal muscles and in the heart. F/Z. Meerson showed that stress causes heart muscles to be exposed to increased calcium, followed by breakdown of fats and proteins, and that these changes keep the injured heart in a continuous state of partial contraction, making it stiff, and resistant to complete contractile shortening. When many cardiologists talk about the heart's stiffness, they are thinking of muscular thickening and fibrosis, but those are late consequences of the kind of contractile, unrelaxed stiffness that Meerson described.The hypothyroid heart does eventually become fibrotic, but before that, it is just unable to relax properly, and unable to contract fully. This failure to empty fully with each contraction is a kind of \"heart failure,\" but it can be corrected very quickly by supplementing thyroid. Even the fibrotic heart can recover under the influence of adequate thyroid.The analogy of the \"coherer\" would suggest that the overstimulated muscle isn't able to decohere itself, until it has had a rest. It responds to stimulation, lets the energy flow, but then can't turn it off, and the energy keeps flowing, because of a change in physical state.Albert Szent-Gyorgyi was probably the first person to seriously investigate the semiconducting properties of living material. Since he was aware of W.F. Koch's idea of a free radical catalyst to support oxidative metabolism, his suggestion in 1941 that cellular proteins could function as electrical conductors (or semiconductors) was very likely based on his research in cellular respiration, as well as on his work with muscle proteins. He had observed that ATP lowers the viscosity of a solution of the muscle protein myosin, and that it would cause a filament formed by precipitating myosin to contract. The polymerization and contraction of proteins under the influence of free radicals was at the heart of F.W. Koch's therapeutic ideas, but Koch's work was about 100 years too early, by medical standards.Szent-Gyorgyi observed that, although ATP was involved in the contraction of muscles, its post-mortem disappearance caused the contraction and hardening of muscles known as rigor mortis. When he put hardened dead muscles into a solution of ATP, they relaxed and softened. The relaxed state is a state with adequate energy reserves.After Szent-Gyorgyi moved to the U.S., in 1947, he demonstrated the effect of muscle cytoplasm on the behavior of fluorescent substances, which was analogous to that of ice, until the muscle was stimulated. During contraction, the fluorescent material behaved as it would in ordinary liquid water. This effect involved the stabilization of the excited state of electrons. This single demonstration should have caused biologists to abandon the membrane theory of cellular excitation, and to return to basic physics for their understanding of cell behavior. The implications of Szent-Gyorgyi's work were enormous for biology and medicine, and even for the understanding of semiconductors, but most of the world was hypnotized by a simple textbook model of cell membranes.Szent-Gyorgyi also demonstrated that the combination of properly balanced electron donors and electron acceptors (D-A pairs) would cause a muscle to contract. He compared this to \"doping\" an inorganic superconductor, to regulate its electronic behavior. Although these experiments were done half a century after Koch's application of free radical chemistry to medicine, they still didn't rouse the pharmaceutical industry from its toxic slumber.I suspect that it was Szent-Gyorgyi's research with those interesting electronic properties of cellular water and proteins that in 1960 gave Linus Pauling the idea to explain anesthesia, specifically noble gas anesthesia, in terms of water clathrate formation, the restructuring of cellular water by the hydrophobic atom or molecule of an anesthetic. His suggestion caused a reaction among biologists that discouraged research into the subject for about 40 years.Gilbert Ling's view of cytoplasmic structure gives a different emphasis to the function of electrons, which I think is an essential complement to Szent-Gyorgyi's view. Ling's emphasis is on how the inductive effect of adsorbed substances (for example, ATP and progesterone has powerful adsorptive effects) on proteins changes the charge concentration on ionizable groups. When the charge concentration is in one configuration (more acidic), the preferred counterion is potassium, and in another (less acidic) configuration, it is sodium.Gilbert Ling's biophysical calculations were useful to physical chemists, and were soon put to practical use for understanding ion exchange resins, such as water softeners. Many sorts of evidence showed their validity for cell physiology, but nearly all biologists rejected them, preferring to talk about membranes, pumps, and channels, despite the evidence showing that the properties ascribed to those are simply impossible. NMR imaging (MRI) was developed by Raymond Damadian specifically as an application of Ling's description of cell physiology.Although metals are conductors, the function of the coherers of Bose and others shows that the surface is a semiconductor, that requires the slight excitation of an electromagnetic wave to become conductive, at which point the conduction band of electrons in the metal becomes coherent and extends from one particle into the others. The surface of any phase of a substance has electronic properties distinct from those of the bulk phase, and in a sense the interface constitutes a special phase of matter.  When the electrons of the interface lose their special properties, the structure of the whole system changes.When a muscle cell is stimulated enough to cause a contraction, the interruption of its resting phase causes a shift in the charge concentration on the proteins, potassium ions are exchanged for sodium ions, calcium ions enter, and phosphate ions separate from ATP, and are replaced by the transfer of phosphate to ADP from creatine phosphate.Since the quantum physicist E. Schroedinger wrote his book, Time's Arrow, people have often thought of life in terms of negentropy, going against the general tendency of entropy to increase, except for aging and death, which are seen as obeying a law of increasing entropy. But A. Zotin investigated organisms, rather than abstractions about electrons, and shows that aging involves a decrease in entropy, and a slowing of metabolism. The decrease of entropy with aging, according to his view, would be analogous to crystallization, a sort of progressive freezing.When a nerve is stimulated, it releases energy suddenly, and much of this heat seems to be the result of a change of structure in the cytoplasm, since (in crustaceans' nerves, which can function at low temperature) during the resting recovery of the nerve, its temperature goes slightly below the ambient temperature, despite the release of some heat from the chemical changes of metabolism, stimulated by the nerve's activity.When a physical change is endothermic, as the nerve's recovery is, that can be interpreted as an increase in overall entropy, as when a rubber band spontaneously contracts, and becomes cooler.Bose's rested coherer, which, with time, spontaneously recovered its semiconductive (i.e., relatively insulating) property, wasn't being powered by metabolism. As the particles returned to their relatively isolated state, there was a decrease of order, and the change was probably somewhat like the spontaneous energy change in the stimulated crustacean nerve. I assume the change would result from the absorption of environmental heat, possibly with infrared resonance with electron conduction bands.Seeing the structure of the cytoplasm as something like a spring-driven mechanism, able to bounce between two states or \"phases,\" makes it easier to see cellular fatigue as something different from the various metabolic energy sources, ATP, glycogen, and oxygen, which--contrary to conventional assumptions--aren't closely tied to the functional losses occurring in fatigue.The role of metabolism, then, becomes analogous to the role of the \"tapper\" in the early forms of the coherer.Water in its normal state is a dielectric. But when it is polarized by an electrical charge, or by the presence of a phase boundary, its normal state is altered. This is the special interfacial water, or vicinal water. With the movement of ions (mainly potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium) during excitation, the state of the cellular water is necessarily changed by the presence of different substances. In the excited state, cell water is less hydrophobic, more hydrophilic than in the relaxed state. A network of \"hydrophobic\" interactions extends through the relaxed cell. One of the properties of a dielectric is that it tends to move into the space between charges, with a force similar in principle to that involved in dielectrophoresis.In the resting state, potassium is the main inorganic ion, and it is associated with acidic groups, such as aspartic and glutamic acid. During excitation, potassium is partly exchanged for sodium, which becomes the preferred counter-ion for the acid groups, and calcium enters the cell along with the sodium. Potassium's interaction with water is very weak (its hydration has been called negative), allowing water to form the structures that are stable in the presence of hydrophobic surfaces. Sodium and especially calcium (smaller atoms, with higher surface charge concentration) powerfully interact with water molecules, more strongly than water interacts with itself, disrupting the delicate somewhat hydrophobic structures of the intracellular water.(Calcium, with its two charges, has important binding and stabilizing functions in the resting cell. In the excited cell, these internal calcium ions are released, while extracellular calcium ions enter the cell.)With the increased movement of charged particles during the stimulation of a nerve or muscle, as one kind of counterion is exchanged for another, and the destruction of some of the water's structure, there are more opportunities for bulk dielectric water to enter cells, interfering with the arrangement of proteins, and tending to cause swelling and separation of the structural elements of the cell. Electron micrographs of fatigued muscle show a remarkable separation of the actin and myosin proteins.In the excited state, NMR studies show that cell water behaves more like bulk water, that is, its molecular movements are relatively free, indicating the momentary loss of the interfacial state. In this state, the uptake of water, and the fatigue-related swelling of nerves and muscles, would be driven at least partly by the principle that a dielectric tends to be pulled into the spaces separating charges. The bulk water that enters a cell during the breakdown of vicinal water functions as an extraneous material somewhat beyond the cell's control.These bulk-like high dielectric properties of water in the excited cellular state can explain many changes of enzyme activity. Previously nonpolar lipids would develop a negative surface charge (from accumulating hydroxyl groups: Marinova, et al., 1996), which would tend to increase their oxidation and degradation. With the loss of the interfacial water, the cell's high energy resting state is replaced by an active mobilization of its resources, to maintain and restore the cell's structure. Metabolic energy begins to flow into the processes of restoration, serving the function of the tapper in the earliest coherers.Looking at fatigability, muscle contraction, and nerve conduction in a variety of situations, we can test some of the traditional explanations, and see how well the newer \"bioelectronic\" explanations fits the facts. Osmotic pressure, hydrostatic pressure, atmospheric pressure, and the degree of metabolic stimulation by thyroid hormone affect fatigue in ways that aren't consistent with the membrane-electrical doctrine.The production of lactic acid during intense muscle activity led some people to suggest that fatigue occurred when the muscle wasn't getting enough oxygen, but experiments show that fatigue sets in while adequate oxygen is being delivered to the muscle. Underwater divers sometimes get an excess of oxygen, and that often causes muscle fatigue and soreness. At high altitudes, where there is relatively little oxygen, strength and endurance can increase.An excess of oxygen can slow nerve conduction, while hypoxia can accelerate it. (Increasing the delivery of oxygen at higher pressure doesn't increase the cellular use of oxygen or decrease lactic acid production in the exercising muscle [Kohzuki, et al., 2000], but it will increase lipid peroxidation.)High hydrostatic pressure causes muscles to contract, though for many years the membrane-doctrinaires couldn't accept that. Underwater divers experience brain excitation under very high pressure. Since vicinal water has a larger volume than ordinary water (analogous to the expansion when ice is formed, though the volume increase in cell water is slightly less, about 4%, than in ice, which is 11% more voluminous than liquid water), compression under high pressure converts vicinal cell water to the state that occurs in the excited cell, the way ice melts under pressure. The excited state exists as long as water remains in that state.These changes of state under pressure are reminiscent of Bose's use of pressure in some of his coherers, and of the fact that pressure alters the sensitivity of electrons in a semiconductor, by altering their \"band gap,\" the amount of energy needed to make them enter the conductive zone.One of the early demonstrations that cell water undergoes a phase change during muscle contraction involved simply measuring the volume of an isolated muscle. With stimulation and contraction, the volume of the muscle decreases slightly. (The muscle was immersed in water in a sealed chamber, and the volume decrease in the whole chamber was measured.)  This corresponds to the conversion of vicinal water to bulk-like (dielectric) water.  (The threatening implications of those experiments with spontaneous volume change were very annoying to many biologists of my professors' generation.)In the stimulated state, the cell's uptake of water from its environment coincides closely with its electrical and thermal activity, and its expulsion of water coincides with its recovery. In a small nerve fiber, or near the surface of a larger fiber, these changes are very fast, and in a large muscle the uptake of water is faster than the flow of water from capillaries can match, but it will become massive if stimulation is continued for several minutes. For example, two minutes of stimulation can cause a muscle's overall weight to increase by 6%, but its extracellular compartment loses 4%, so the muscle cells gain much more than 6% of their weight in that short time (Ward, et al., 1996). The water that is taken up by cells is taken from the blood, which becomes relatively dehydrated and thicker in the process.The belief in \"semipermeable membranes\" (which hasn't been a viable explanation of cell physiology for a very long time) forces people to explain cell swelling osmotically, which means that they simply assume that the number of solute particles inside the cell has drastically increased in a very short time. In Tasaki's experiments (1980, 1981, 1982), the swelling in a nerve coincides with the electrical action potential, which, according to the osmotic explanation, means that a very large increase in internal osmolarity happened in essentially no time. The action potential comes and goes in about 2 milliseconds. The swelling also coincides with heat production and shortening of the nerve fiber. The shrinkage of the nerve fiber after the end of the action potential may be just as rapid, and the membrane theory offers no explanation for that, either. (But the restoration of the unswollen state can be very prolonged, depending on conditions extrinsic to the particular muscle or cell.) Troshin's survey of the theory of osmotic regulation of cell volume showed that the idea of the cell as a membrane osmometer was false, but very few biologists read his book.Since the excited or fatigued muscle or nerve swells and gains weight, it's interesting to see what happens to their sensitivity and strength when they are exposed to hypotonic solutions that tend to promote swelling, or to hypertonic solutions, that help to prevent swelling.In a hypotonic solution, cells are excited (Lang, et al., 1995: \"Exposure of aortic strips from guinea-pigs to hypotonic extracellular fluid is followed by marked vasoconstriction...\"), but the early excitation is followed by decreased responsiveness (Ohba, et al., 1984: \"Exposure of muscle to hypotonic solutions [70% of normal solution] produced initially a transient increase in twitch after which twitch declined below the control level\"). Hypertonic solutions tend to produce relaxation in normal muscles, including the aorta (Tabrizchi, 1999), but when muscle function is impaired (especially in the circulatory system, as in shock) they improve contractile function (Elgjo, et al., 1998: \"The maximum contraction force measured in isolated right papillary muscles ex vivo was significantly greater in HSD-treated than normal saline-treated animals\"). Athletes can lose 4% of their weight by dehydration without decreasing their muscular strength.Hypothyroidism tends to cause loss of sodium from the blood, and the hyponatremia sometimes leads to a generalized hypotonicity of the body fluids. The thyroid hormone itself functions as an antioxidant, but much of its protective effect against cell damage is probably the result of preventing cell swelling and accelerating the removal of calcium from the cell. (Swelling, like fatigue, causes intracellular calcium to increase.)The electrical surface charging of lipids in bulk water probably accounts for the increased lipid peroxidation that occurs in fatigue, edema, and hypothyroidism, when water loses its normal partial hydrophobicity. Increased carbon dioxide is known to decrease lipid peroxidation, and its production requires adequate thyroid function.Thyroid stimulation of oxygen consumption tends to prevent lactic acid production, because it keeps the cytoplasm in a state of relative oxidation, i.e., it keeps the concentration of NAD+ hundreds of times higher than that of NADH. NADH is required for the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. It is also the source of reducing potential in many kinds of toxic redox cycling, that generate lipid peroxides, and it maintains the sulfhydryl system, involving the balance of reduced glutathione with the sulfhydryl-disulfide system of protein bonds, which governs the cell's electronic state and affects its balance of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity.The harmful lipid oxidation interferes with energy production and regulatory processes, and is responsible for some of the prolonged effects of fatigue, swelling, and hypothyroidism. These lingering effects of lipid oxidation are undoubtedly amplified by the presence of larger amounts of unstable polyunsaturated fats, as the energy demands of the fatigued state mobilize free fatty acids from the tissues.One of the oldest tests for hypothyroidism was the Achilles tendon reflex test, in which the rate of relaxation of the calf muscle corresponded to thyroid function--the relaxation is slow in hypothyroid people. Water, sodium and calcium are more slowly expelled by the hypothyroid muscle. Exactly the same slow relaxation occurs in the hypothyroid heart muscle, contributing to congestive heart failure, because the semi-contracted heart can't receive as much blood as the normally relaxed heart. The hypothyroid blood vessels are unable to relax properly, contributing to hypertension. Hypothyroid nerves don't easily return to their energized relaxed state, leading to insomnia, paresthesias, movement disorders, and nerves that are swollen and very susceptible to pressure damage.With aging, hypothyroidism, stress, and fatigue, the amount of estrogen in the body typically rises. Estrogen is catabolic for muscle, and causes systemic edema, and nerve excitation. It weakens muscle contraction in the bladder, although it lowers the threshold for stimulation of sensation and contraction (Dambros, et al., 2004). This is the pattern that causes people to wake up frequently, to pass a small amount of urine. (Progesterone has the opposite effect in the urinary bladder, raising the threshold of response, but strengthening contraction, as it does in the gallbladder.) Estrogen lowers stimulation threshold in the gallbladder, as it does in the brain. Part of its excitatory action might be the result of increased hypotonic tissue water, but its effects on nerve thresholds are practically instantaneous.In 1971 and '72, I gave some of the reasons for thinking that estrogen's biological effects result from its direct effects on cell water, causing it to become more like bulk (high dielectric) water. For example, NMR (spin echo) of estrogen treated uterus and of the uterus from an old animal were closer to bulk water than that of a young animal. Estrogen, like fatigue or excessive oxygen, slows nerve conduction.Lactic acid production increases with fatigue, aging, hypothyroidism, estrogen excess, and other inefficient biological states. Its presence, when oxygen is available, indicates that something is interfering with efficient oxidative energy metabolism. Ammonia, free fatty acids, and various inflammatory cytokines are also likely to increase in those stress states.A dangerously high level of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia) can be produced by exhaustive exercise, but also by hyperbaric oxygen (or a high concentration of oxygen), by high estrogen, and by hypothyroidism. It tends to be associated with an excess of lactic acid, probably because ammonia stimulates glycolysis. Excess oxygen, like hypothyroidism, is equivalent to \"hyperventilation,\" in producing an abnormally low level of carbon dioxide in the blood. The Krebs cycle, during stress, is limited by the unavailability of carbon dioxide. These factors result in the waste of glucose, turning it into lactic acid, rather than carbon dioxide and energy. In these ways, the metabolism of fatigued muscle (or any cell under stress) is similar to tumor metabolism.Hyperammonemia disturbs excitatory processes, and can cause seizures, as well as stupor, and is probably involved in mania and depression. Lithium happens to complex electronically with ammonia, and I think that accounts for some of its therapeutic effects, but carbon dioxide is the main physiological factor in the elimination of ammonia, since it combines with it to form urea. The changes in cell water in the excited/fatigued state represent an increase in the water's \"structural temperature,\" and that would imply that less carbon dioxide could remain dissolved during excitation.Eating sugar and using caffeine, which increases the oxidation of sugar (Yeo, et al., 2005), can reduce fatigue, both subjectively and objectively. Metabolically, they increase the production of carbon dioxide. Increasing sugar decreases the liberation and use of fatty acids, and by a variety of mechanisms, helps to lower the production of ammonia, lactate, and inflammatory cytokines. (Lactic acid, in combination with acidosis and free phospholipids, can interfere with efficient cell functions [Pacini and Kane, 1991; Boachie-Ansah, et al., 1992].) Free fatty acids release tryptophan from albumin, contributing to the formation of serotonin, which increases the sense of fatigue.Aspirin and niacin help to prevent fatigue symptoms, and to prevent many of the harmful systemic oxidative after-effects. (Both are antilipolytic; aspirin uncouples mitochondria.)Uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism from ATP production helps to consume the sugar which otherwise would be diverted into lactic acid, and converts it into carbon dioxide instead. Mild hypoxia, as at high altitude, suppresses lactic acid production (\"the lactate paradox\"), and increases the amount of carbon dioxide in tissues.Aspirin and thyroid (T3) increase uncoupling. A drug that used to be used for weight reduction, DNP, also uncouples mitochondrial metabolism, and, surprisingly, it has some of the beneficial effects of thyroid and aspirin. It stimulates the consumption of lactic acid and the formation of carbon dioxide.The squirrel monkey, which on average weighs about 2 or 3 pounds as an adult, lives much longer than other mammals of its size, usually about 20 years, as long as 27. It has an extremely high rate of oxygen consumption. This is probably the result of natural uncoupling of the mitochondria, similar to that seen in long-lived mice. Mice with 17% higher resting oxygen consumption lived 36% longer than slow respiring mice of a related strain (Speakman, et al., 2004).Living at a high altitude, people tend to eat more and stay leaner than when they live near sea level. Apparently, their mitochondria are relatively uncoupled, and they have more mitochondria, which would partly account for their lower production of lactic acid during muscular exertion. Increased thyroid activity, too, tends to increase mitochondrial mass, as well as their uncoupling.Most of the things that we think of as fatigue result from disturbances of the hydration of cells, whose sensitivity, composition, and structure change according to the extent of the disturbance. The hydration is governed by the cells' \"electrical\" properties, which are regulated by internal metabolic processes and by systemic processes. When cellular fatigue reaches a certain point, only the interactions of all the organs can restore stable cellular structure and functions. The liver eliminates lactic acid and ammonia, the adrenals and gonads provide stabilizing steroids, and the brain alters activity and behavior, in ways that can reverse most of the effects of fatigue.But, when the tissues contain large amounts of polyunsaturated fats, every episode of fatigue and prolonged excitation leaves a residue of oxidative damage, and the adaptive mechanisms become progressively less effective. When the most powerful adaptive mechanisms, such as the timely synthesis of progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA, T3, and the inhibitory transmitters, GABA and glycine, fail, then some of the primitive defense mechanisms will become chronically activated, and even sleep may fail to restore normal cellular water and metabolism. Hyperventilation often becomes a problem, making capillary leakiness worse.Water in the body occupies three major compartments--blood vessels, extracellular matrix, and the moist cell substance itself--and its condition in each compartment is a little different, and subject to variation. There are no textbooks in use in the U.S. that treat intracellular water scientifically, and the result is that physicians are confused when they see patients with edema or with disturbances in blood volume. It rarely occurs to physicians to consider disturbances of water distribution in problems such as chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, sleep disturbances, frequent urination, slow bladder emptying, anxiety, paresthesia, movement disorders, the tunnel syndromes, or even slowed thinking, but \"intracellular fatigue\" leading to over-hydration is probably the central problem in these, and many other degenerative and inflammatory problems.The improvements in cell functions and water distribution that are inversely related to oxygen pressure, and directly related to carbon dioxide, won't be discussed in medical textbooks until they have given up the idea of membrane-regulated cells.The \"treatment\" for intracellular fatigue consists of normalizing thyroid and steroid metabolism, and eating a diet including fruit juice, milk, some eggs or liver, and gelatin, assuring adequate calcium, potassium sodium, and magnesium, and using supplements of niacin-amide, aspirin, and carbon dioxide when necessary. Simply increasing carbon dioxide decreases lactic acid and ammonia, increases GABA (the sleep improving nerve inhibitor), and regulates mineral and water disposition.One of the outcomes of the study of the physiology of fatigue is that it leads to a better understanding of cells in general, and offers some new insights into aging, inflammation, and a variety of stress-related diseases.REFERENCESMinerva Med. 1966 Feb 21;57(15):599-604.

        "chunk_html": "Meat physiology, stress, and degenerative physiologyThe US Department of Agriculture claims that the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906 and the Meat Inspection Act of the same year were passed because the food industry demanded them. Ordinary historians believe that Upton Sinclair's 1905 serial publication of his novel about the meat industry, The Jungle, caused the public and Theodore Roosevelt to pressure Congress to pass the laws. Sinclair's descriptions of the use of poisonous preservatives and deodorants to disguise the smell of rotten meat angered the public and the president enough to overcome the industry pressure that had kept the US Congress from regulating the commercial food supply long after European governments had begun regulating food production and sales.Before the government's intervention, it was common practice to soak all kinds of meat in water or chemical solutions to increase their weight. At present, the US Department of Agriculture, through the mass media and funding the training of food technologists and \"meat scientists,\" now takes the position that it is natural for meat to leak water after it is packaged, and says it is perfectly legal for meat producers to soak the meat in water with chemicals until it has increased its weight by 8%. The chemicals, such as trisodium phosphate (in a solution strength as high as 12%), are chosen because they powerfully stimulate swelling and water retention. Considerable amounts of some chemicals, such as sodium citrate, are allowed to add to the weight of the meat. The use of ozone and hydrogen peroxide to deodorize meat causes instantaneous oxidative changes, including lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl formation, as well as increasing water retention.Most supermarket meat is now packaged with thick diapers so the buyer won't notice that he is paying for a sizeable amount of pink water. The USDA has an internet site, and consumer hotlines, to inform angry consumers that they are mistaken if they believe that meat shouldn't leak. They explain that meat is now \"bred\" to contain less fat, and so it contains more water, and that it is simply the leanness of the meat that accounts for its poor flavor.Before the slaughtered animal is put into the soaking solution to gain a specific amount of weight, the animal has almost always been treated in ways that cause it to go to slaughter in a state of massive edema. Even before the meat is soaked, the animal has been treated to maximize its water retention.Muscle physiologists and endocrine physiologists know that fatigue, stress and excess estrogen can cause the tissues to swell hugely, increasing their weight and water content without increasing their protein content.As soon as cheap synthetic estrogens, such as DES, became available in the 1940s, their use in animals was promoted because it was clear that they caused massive water retention. Women who suffer from hyperestrogenism always have a problem with water retention, but they have never been known to suffer from over-developed skeletal muscles. In fact, in humans of both sexes, an excess of estrogen has been commonly associated with sarcopenia, muscular dystrophy, and atrophy of the skeletal muscles. Similar observations have been made in a variety of animals. Meat scientists are the only people I know of who have ever referred to estrogen as an anabolic steroid, in the sense of \"building muscle.\"When it was publicized around 1970 that DES is powerfully carcinogenic, after it had been used for several decades in the meat industry, its use was outlawed, but its illegal use continued and was overlooked by the US government. The Swiss government has rejected meat from a large producer in Kansas because it contained DES. Other estrogens are openly used, and the US government continues to apply pressure to other countries to accept meat exports containing estrogens.There are many ways to increase the water content of meat, besides feeding estrogen to the animal and soaking the meat after slaughter. Everything that causes water retention and tissue swelling in the living animal, that is, every kind of stress, fatigue, poisoning, malnutrition and injury, will make the animal gain weight, without consuming expensive nutritious food. Crowding, fright, and other suffering increase water retention and accelerate the breakdown of fats and proteins.The water content of meat shouldn't be increased by any of those methods, not only because it is a form of stealing from the consumer, but because it makes the product toxic and unappetizing, and makes the production process a degrading experience.Any chemicals, such as estrogen or arsenic, that remain in the meat are of course harmful to the consumer, but the changes they produce in the animals' tissues are the main problem. When grains and soybeans are used for fattening animals, their characteristic fatty acids are present in the meat, and are harmful to the consumer, but their complex degradation products, such as isoprene, acrolein, and isoprostanes, remain, along with the complex changes they induce in every aspect of the tissue. The reactive products of oxidative fat degradation stimulate, among other things, the adaptive/defensive production of polyamines, small molecules derived from amino acids. The polyamines, in turn, can be oxidized, producing highly toxic aldehydes, including acrolein (Sakata, et al., 2003). These molecules stimulate cell multiplication, and alter, at least temporarily, the way the cell's genes function.An excess of water stimulates cell division, and an important mechanism in producing that effect is the increased production of polyamines by the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. This enzyme is activated by an excess of water (hypotonicity), by estrogen, and by stress.Besides stimulating cell division and modifying the cell's state of differentiation (including developmental imprinting), the polyamines also contribute to nerve cell excitation and excitotoxicity. Estrogen and excess water can contribute to nerve cell excitation, for example producing convulsive seizures. The polyamines are increased during seizures, and they can affect the stability of the nerve cells, for example contributing to cocaine's seizure-sensitizing action. Although they tend to block free radicals, they accelerate nerve injury (Yatin, et al., 2001), and can contribute to breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (Wengenack, et al., 2000, Koenig, et al., 1989).The polyamines are increased in cancers, and therapies to block their formation are able to stop the growth of various cancers, including prostate, bowel, and breast cancer. Metabolites of the polyamines in the urine appear to be useful as indicators of cancer and other diseases. (In pancreatic cancer, Yamaguchi, et al., 2004; in cervical cancer, Lee, et al., 2003; in adult respiratory stress syndrome, Heffner, et al., 1995.)  The quantity of polyamines in the urine of cancer patients has been reported to be 20 times higher than normal (Jiang, 1990). Polyamines in the red blood cells appear to indicate prognosis in prostate cancer (Cipolla, et al., 1990).The prostaglandins in semen have been suspected to have a role in producing cervical cancer (Fernandez, et al., 1995).In protein catabolism, one fate of the protein's nitrogen is to be converted to the polyamines, rather than to urea. In plants, at least, these small molecules help cells to balance osmotic stresses.Adding water to meat, or stressing the animals before slaughter, will increase the meat's content of the polyamines, but the longer the meat is stored, the greater will be the production of reactive oxygen products and polyamines.The deliberate \"aging\" of meat is something that the meat scientists often write about, but it has a peculiar history, and is practiced mainly in the English speaking cultures. When a supermarket in Mexico City began selling U.S.-style meat for the American colony, I got some T-bone steaks and cooked them for some of my Mexican friends. The meat wasn't water-logged (it was 1962, and the beef had been grown in Mexico), but it had been aged for the American customers, and though my friends ate the steaks for the sake of politeness, I could see that they found it difficult.In Mexico, even in the present century, butcher shops often don't have refrigeration, and they don't need it because they sell the meat immediately. The fresh meat tastes fresh. Traditionally, liver is sold only on the day of slaughter, because its high enzyme content causes it to degrade much faster than the muscle meats. When it is fresh, it lacks the characteristic bad taste of liver in the US.Both the liver and the muscles contain a significant amount of glycogen when they are fresh, if the animal was healthy. At first, the lack of oxygen causes the glycogen to be metabolized into lactic acid, and some fatty acids are liberated from their bound form, producing slight changes in the taste of the meat. But when the glycogen has been depleted, the anaerobic metabolism accelerates the breakdown of proteins and amino acids.In the absence of oxygen, no carbon dioxide is produced, and the result is that the normal disposition of ammonia from amino acids as urea is blocked, and the polyamines are formed instead. The chemical names of two of the main poly-amines are suggestive of the flavors that they impart to the aging meat: Cadaverine and putrescine. After two or three weeks of aging, there has been extensive breakdown of proteins and fats, with the production of very complex new mixtures of chemicals.Mexicans, despite their low average income, have a very high per capita consumption of meat, as do several other Latin American countries. Argentina has a per capita meat consumption of nearly a pound a day. There is a lot of theorizing about the role of meat in causing cancer, for example comparing Japan's low mortality from prostate cancer, and their low meat consumption, with the high prostate cancer mortality in the US, which has a higher meat consumption. But Argentina and Mexico's prostate cancer mortality ranks very favorably with Japan's.If meat consumption in the US contributes to the very high cancer rate, it clearly isn't the quantity of meat consumed, but rather the quality of the meat.The polar explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson was interested in the health effects of a diet based on meat, because of his observation that fresh meat prevented scurvy much more effectively than the fruits and vegetables carried by other polar explorers. He commented on the importance of culture and learning in shaping food preferences:\"In midwinter it occurred to me to philosophize that in our own and foreign lands taste for a mild cheese is somewhat plebeian; it is at least a semi-truth that connoisseurs like their cheeses progressively stronger. The grading applies to meats, as in England where it is common among nobility and gentry to like game and pheasant so high that the average Midwestern American or even Englishman of a lower class, would call them rotten.\"I knew of course that, while it is good form to eat decayed milk products and decayed game, it is very bad form to eat decayed fish. I knew also that the view of our populace that there are likely to be \"ptomaines\" in decaying fish and in the plebeian meats; but it struck me as an improbable extension of the class-consciousness that ptomaines would avoid the gentleman's food and attack that of a commoner.\"These thoughts led to a summarizing query; If it is almost a mark of social distinction to be able to eat strong cheeses with a straight face and smelly birds with relish, why is it necessarily a low taste to be fond of decaying fish? On that basis of philosophy, though with several qualms, I tried the rotten fish one day, and if memory serves, liked it better than my first taste of Camembert. During the next weeks I became fond of rotten fish.\"Since Stefansson's observations nearly a century ago, most Americans have become accustomed to the taste of half-spoiled meat, as part of the process of adapting to an industrial-commercial food system. Tests done by food technologists have found that most Americans prefer the taste of synthetic strawberry flavor in ice cream to the taste of ice cream made with real strawberries. If it took Stefansson only a few weeks to become fond of rotten fish, it isn't surprising that the public would, over a period of many decades, learn to enjoy a diet of stale foods and imitation foods.Polyamines are increased in stressed and stored vegetables, as in aged meats. This defensive reaction retards tissue aging, and researchers are testing the application of polyamines to fruits to retard their ripening. A plastic surgeon, Vladimir Filatov, discovered that tissue stored in the cold stimulated the healing process when used for tissue reconstruction, such as corneal transplants. He found that stressed plant tissues developed the same tissue stimulants. Another pioneer of tissue transplantation, L.V. Polezhaev, saw that degenerating tissue produced factors that seem to activate stem cells.Although the diffusion of these stimulating factors from stressed tissues normally functions to accelerate healing and tissue regeneration, under less optimal conditions they are undoubtedly important factors in tissue degeneration and tumor formation. For example, the bystander effect (contributing to delayed radiation damage, and producing a field of precancerous changes around a cancer), in which substances diffusing from injured tissues damage surrounding cells, involves disturbances in polyamine metabolism.The direct, optimal effects of the polyamines are protective, but when excessive, prolonged, or without maintained cellular energy, they become harmful.The expression of genes involves their physical arrangement and accessibility to enzymes and substrates. The negatively charged nucleic acids are associated with positively charge proteins, the histones. The very small positively charged polyamines can powerfully modify the interactions between histones and DNA. In recent years people have begun to speak of the \"histone code,\" as a kind of expansion of the idea of the \"genetic code.\" But the polyamines, produced in response to stress, might be thought of as a complex expansion of the \"histone code.\"The addition of small molecules, methyl and acetyl groups, to the large molecules can regulate the expression of genes, and these patterns can be passed on transgenerationally, or modified by stress. Barbara McClintock's \"controlling factors\" were mobile genes that caused the genome to be restructured under the influence of stress. Her discoveries were the same as those made by Trofim Lysenko decades earlier, and like his observations, McClintock's were angrily rejected until the 1980s, when the genetic engineering industry needed some scientific background and natural precedent for their unnatural intervention in the genome.The brain is extremely different from a malignant tumor, and the derangements produced by stress, by high cortisol and estrogen and an excess of water, are different in the two types of organ (considering the tumor as an ad hoc organ), but the polyamines have central roles in the degenerating brain and in the divergent disorganization of tumors. Their importance in stress physiology is coming to be recognized, along with the meaning of \"epigenetic development,\" in which the influence of the environment becomes central, rather than just a place in which the \"genotype\" is allowed to passively express its \"genetic potential.\" Every developmental decision involves an evaluation of resources and their optimal marshaling for adaptation. The polyamines are part of the cytoplasm's equipment for controlling the genome. The ratio between the different types of polyamine governs the nature of their regulation of cellular functions.The old idea, \"one is what one eats,\" has evolved far beyond ideas of simple nutritional adequacy or deprivation, and it's now commonly accepted that many things in foods have fairly direct effects on our brain transmitters and hormones, such as serotonin, dopamine, adrenalin, endorphins, prostaglandins, and other chemicals that affect our behavior and physiology.In 1957 James McConnell discovered that when flatworms were fed other flatworms that had been trained, their performance was improved by 50%, compared with normal flatworms. Later, similar experiments were done with rats and fish, showing that tissue extracts from trained animals modified the behavior of the untrained animals so that it approximated that of the trained animals. Georges Ungar, who did many experiments with higher animals, demonstrated changes in brain RNA associated with learning, and he and McConnell believed that proteins and peptides were likely to be the type of substance that transmitted the learning.A dogmatic belief that \"memory molecules\" would be unable to penetrate the \"blood-brain barrier\" allowed most biologists to dismiss their work. Ungar's death, and the hostility of most biologists to their work, have caused their ideas to be nearly forgotten for the last 30 years. Negatively charged molecules such as ordinary proteins tend to be repelled by negative charges on the wall of capillaries, but positively charged molecules spontaneously associate with cellular proteins, and easily penetrate the barrier. Highly positively charged molecules tend to concentrate in the brain (Jonkman, et al., 1983), and people are currently attempting to use the principle to deliver antibodies (which are normally excluded from the brain) therapeutically to the brain by combining them with small positively charged molecules (Herve, et al., 2001). This affinity of the brain for positively charged molecules is gradually being recognized as an important factor in the toxicity of ammonia and guanidine derivatives. As mentioned earlier, even endogenous polyamines can be involved in disruption of the blood-brain barrier.So, apart from the question of exactly what molecules were responsible for the learning transfer produced by McConnell and Ungar, there should be no doubt that polyamines derived from food can enter tissues, especially the brain. People who eat meat from stressed animals are substantially replicating the experiments of McConnell and Ungar, except that people normally eat a variety of foods, and each type of food will have had slightly different experiences in its last days of life. But the deliberate aging of meat is subjecting it to a standardized stress--two or three weeks of cold storage. Because of the great generality of genetic processes, it wouldn't be surprising if cold storage of vegetables turned out to produce polyamine patterns similar to those of cold storage meats. Air pollution and other stressful growing conditions cause vegetables to have very high levels of polyamines.Prolonged exposure to certain patterns of polyamines might produce particular syndromes, but the mere fact of increasing the total quantity of polyamines in our diet is likely to increase the incidence of stress-related diseases. Experiments with cells in culture show that added polyamines can produce a variety of extremely harmful changes, but so far, there has been almost no investigation of their specific regulatory functions, of their \"code.\"Besides rejecting stale foods produced under stressful conditions, there are probably some specific ways that we can protect ourselves from polyamine poisoning.When the organism is functioning efficiently, its respiration is producing an abundance of carbon dioxide, which protectively modifies many systems and structures. Adequate carbon dioxide protects against fatigue, cellular and vascular leakiness, edema and swelling.Increasing carbon dioxide will tend to direct ammonia into urea synthesis, and away from the formation of polyamines. Bicarbonate protects against many of the toxic effects of ammonia, and since carbon dioxide spontaneously reacts with amino groups, it probably helps to inactivate exogenous polyamines. This could account for some of the protective effects of carbon dioxide (or high altitude), for example its anti-seizure, anticancer, and antistress effects.Other things that protect against excessive polyamines are procaine and other local anesthetics (Yuspa, et al., 1980), magnesium, niacin, vitamin A, aspirin, and, in some circumstances, caffeine. Since endotoxin stimulates the formation of polyamines, a diet that doesn't irritate the intestine is important. Tryptophan and methionine contribute to the formation of polyamines, so gelatin, which lacks those amino acids and is soothing to the intestine, should be a regular part of the diet.Because the polyamines intensity the neurotoxic and carcinogenic effects of estrogen and of polyunsaturated fats, those three types of substance should be considered as a functional unit in making food choices. (Grass-fed organic beef fresh from a local farm would be a reasonable choice.) Unfortunately, the meat industry has maximized all of those dangers, just for the increased weight of their product.REFERENCESBiull Eksp Biol Med 1993 Jun;115(6):600-2.

The idea that putrefaction of the stools causes disease, i.e., intestinal autointoxication, originated with physicians in ancient Egypt. They believed that a putrefactive principle associated with feces was absorbed in to the general circulation, where it acted to produce fever and pus. This description of the materia peccans represented the earliest forerunner of our present notion of endotoxin and its effect. The ancient Greeks extended the concept of putrefaction to involve not only the residues of food, but also those of bile, phlegm, and blood, incorporating it into their humoral theory of disease. During the 19th century, the early biochemical and bacteriologic studies lent credence to the idea of ptomaine poisoning--that degradation of protein in the colon by anerobic bacteria generated toxic amines. Among the leading proponents of autointoxication was Metchnikoff, who hypothesized that intestinal toxins shortened lifespan. The toxic process, however, was reversed by the consumption of lactic acid-producing bacteria that changed the colonic microflora and prevented proteolysis. The next logical step in treatment followed in the early 20th century when surgeons, chief among them Sir W. Arbuthnot Lane, performed colectomy to cure intestinal autointoxication. By the 1920s, the medical doctrine fell into disrepute as scientific advances failed to give support. However, the idea persists in the public mind, probably as an extension of the childhood habit of toilet training.Prog Urol. 1992 Feb;2(1):50-7.

        "chunk_html": "MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND OTHER HORMONE-RELATED BRAIN SYNDROMES (1993)Since I am trying to discuss a complex matter in a single article, I have separately outlined the essential technical points of the argument in a section at the beginning, then I explain how my ideas on the subject developed, and finally there is a glossary.  If you start with \"Short-day brain stress,\" \"Estrogen's effects,\" and \"Symptoms and therapies,\" you will have the general picture, and can use the other sections to fill in the technical details.THE ARGUMENT:1) The hormones pregnenolone, thyroid, and estrogen are involved in several ways with the changes that occur in multiple sclerosis, but no one talks about them.2) The process of myelination is known to depend on the thyroid hormone.  The myelinating cells are the oligodendroglia (oligodendrocytes) which appear to stop functioning in MS (and  sometimes to a milder degree in Alzheimer's disease, and other  conditions).  The cells' absorption of thyroid hormone is influenced by dietary factors.3) The oligodendrocytes are steroid-producing cells (1),  and steroidogenesis is dependent on thyroid hormone, and on  thyroid-dependent respiratory enzymes and on the heme-enzyme P-450scc, which are all sensitive (2) to poisoning by carbon monoxide and cyanide.  The steroid produced by the oligodendrocytes is pregnenolone, which is known to have a profound  anti-stress action (3), and which appears to be the main  brain-protective steroid.4) Lesions resembling those of MS can be produced experimentally by carbon monoxide or cyanide poisoning.(4)  The lesions  tend to be associated with individual small blood vessels, which   are likely to contain clots.  (Since all animals have enzymes to  detoxify cyanide, this poison is apparently a universal problem,  and can originate in the bowel. \"Detoxified\" cyanide is still toxic to the thyroid.)5) Pregnenolone and progesterone protect against nerve damage (5) by the excitotoxic amino acids (glutamic acid, aspartic acid, monosodium glutamate, aspartame, etc.), while estrogen (6) and cortisol (7) are nerve-destroying, acting through the excitotoxic amino acids.  Excitotoxins destroy certain types of nerve, especially the dopaminergic and cholinergic types, leaving the noradrenergic types (8), paralleling the changes that occur in aging.  The clustering of oligodendrocytes around deteriorating nerve cells could represent an adaptive attempt to provide pregnenolone to injured nerve cells.6) The involvement of hormones and environmental factors probably accounts for the intermittent progress of multiple sclerosis. To the extent that the environmental factors can be  corrected, the disease can probably be controlled.SHORT-DAY BRAIN STRESSShortly after I moved from Mexico to Montana, one of my students, a 32 year old woman, began having the same sensory symptoms her older sister had experienced at the same age, at the onset of multiple sclerosis.  Vertigo and visual distortions of some sort made her consider withdrawing from the university. I'm not sure why she tried eating a whole can of tuna for lunch a couple of days after the onset of symptoms, but it seemed to alleviate the symptoms, and she stayed on a high protein diet and never had a recurrence.  She told me some of the lore of MS: That it mostly affects young adults between the ages of 20 and 40, that it is common in high latitudes and essentially unknown in the tropics, and that it is sometimes exacerbated by pregnancy and stress.  (Later, I learned that systemic lupus erythematosis and other \"auto-immune\" diseases also tend to occur mainly during the reproductive years.  I discussed some of the implications of this in \"Bean Syndrome.\")Having enjoyed the mild climate of Mexico, I became very conscious of the harm done to us by northern winters, and began developing the idea of \"winter sickness.\"  In 1966-67, allergies, PMS, weight gain, colitis, and arthritis came to my attention as winter-related problems, and I assumed that the high-latitude incidence of MS related to what I was seeing and experiencing.  Studies in Leningrad began revealing that mitochondria are injured during darkness, and repaired during daylight.  I observed that hamsters' thymus glands shrank in the winter and regenerated in the summer; shrinkage of the thymus gland is a classical feature of stress, and usually reflects the dominance of cortisone, though estrogen and testosterone also cause it to shrink.  Winter's darkness is stressful in a very fundamental way, and like any stress it tends to suppress thyroid function.  In the hypothyroid state, any estrogen which is produced tends to accumulate in the body, because of liver sluggishness.I began to see that PMS could be controlled by certain things--extra light, supplements of sodium and magnesium, high quality protein, and correction of deficiencies of thyroid and progesterone.  In working on my dissertation, I saw that tissue hypoxia (lower than optimal concentrations of oxygen in the blood) may result from estrogen excess, vitamin E deficiency, or aging.  There is a close biological parallel between estrogen-dominance and the other hypoxic states, such as stress/shock, and aging.ESTROGEN'S EFFECTSAs a portrait painter, I had been very conscious of the blue aspect that can often be seen in the skin of young women. In pale areas, the color may actually be blue, and in areas with a rich supply of blood, such as the lips, the color is lavender during times of high estrogen influence--around ovulation and puberty, for example.  During these times of estrogen dominance, the blood is not only poorly oxygenated, but it has other special properties, such as an increased tendency to clot.  The Shutes' work in the 1930s began with the use of vitamin E to antagonize estrogen's clot-promoting tendency, and led them to the discovery that vitamin E can be very therapeutic in heart disease.  More recently, it has been found that men with heart disease have abnormally high estrogen (9), that women using oral contraceptives have higher mortality from heart attacks (10), and that estrogen tends to  promote spasm of blood vessels (11).  (These reactions are probably  related to the physiology of menstruation, in which progesterone withdrawal causes spasms in the spiral arteries of the uterus,  producing endometrial anoxia and cell death.)In toxemia of late pregnancy, or eclampsia, the exaggerated clotting tendency caused by excess estrogen (or by inadequately opposed estrogen, i.e., progesterone deficiency), can cause convulsions and strokes.  Vascular spasms could be involved here, too.  The stasis caused by the vasospasm would facilitate clotting. (Vascular spasm has been observed in epilepsy, too.  Epilepsy can be brought on by the premenstrual excess of estrogen, and in that situation there is no evidence that clotting is involved.  Leakage of hemoglobin out of red cells can cause vasospasm, so bleeding, clotting, strokes, and seizures can interact complexly.)  The brains of women who have died following eclampsia show massive clotting in the blood vessels, and their livers are characteristically injured, with clots (12).Tom Brewer and others have shown very clearly that malnutrition, especially protein deficiency, is the cause of toxemia of late pregnancy.  (In Nutrition for Women, I discussed the importance of protein in allowing the liver to eliminate estrogen.)Various researchers have demonstrated that the plaques of MS usually occur in the area served by a single blood vessel (13, 14), and some have suggested that clotting is the cause.  MS patients have been found to have an abnormal clotting time, and it has been suggested that an altered diet might be able to correct the clotting tendency.Studies in animals have shown clearly that a protein deficiency increases the fibrinogen content of blood. (Field and Dam, 1946.)  Other factors that increase blood clotting are elevated adrenalin and cortisone.  Protein deficiency causes an adaptive decrease in thyroid function, which leads to a compensatory increase in adrenaline and cortisone.  The combination of high estrogen with high adrenaline increases the tendency for both clots and spasms of the blood vessels (11).In experimental poisoning of animals with carbon monoxide or cyanide, the brain lesions resembling MS include blood clots.  The patchy distribution of these spots in the brain suggests that the clotting is secondary to metabolic damage in the brain.  Presumably, the same would be true in ordinary MS, with clots and spasms being induced in certain areas by metabolic abnormalities in brain cells.  The injured cells that are responsible for myelination of nerve fibers are steroid-forming cells.  A failure to secrete their protective pregnenolone could cause a local spasm of a blood vessel.  The circulatory problem would exacerbate the respiratory problem. Steroid production is dependent on NADH and NADPH, and so requires adequate energy supplies and energy metabolism.  The phenomenon of blood-sludging, studied by M. Knisely at the University of Chicago in the l930s and l940s, is apparently a general result of decreased energy metabolism, and is likely to be a factor in energy-and-circulatory vicious circles.SYMPTOMS AND THERAPIESAround 1976 I met a woman in her mid-thirties who heard about my work with progesterone in animals.  She had been disabled by a brain disease that resembled MS or Devic's disease, inflammation of the optic nerves.  It would sometimes cause blindness and paralysis that persisted for weeks at a time.  During remissions, sometimes using a wheelchair, she would go to the medical school library to try to understand her condition.  She came across Katherina Dalton's work with progesterone, and convinced a physician to give her a trial injection.  Although she had trouble finding people who were willing to give her progesterone, her recovery was so complete that she was able to climb stairs and drive her car, and she came  to my endocrinology class and gave a very good (and long) lecture on progesterone therapy.  Although her sensory and motor functions became normal, she remained very fat, and chronically suffered from sore areas on her arms and legs that seemed to be abnormal blood vessels, possibly with phlebitis.  She appeared to need thyroid hormone as well as larger amounts of progesterone, but never found a physician who would cooperate, as far as I know.In the late 1970s I was seeing a lot of people who had puzzling health problems.  In a period of two or three years, there were five people who had been diagnosed by neurologists as having multiple sclerosis.  In talking to them, it seemed clear that they had multiple symptoms of hypothyroidism.   They weren't severely disabled.  Since they weren't fat or lethargic, their physicians hadn't thought they could be hypothyroid.  When they tried taking a thyroid supplement, all of their symptoms disappeared, including those that had led to their MS diagnosis.  One of the women went to her doctor to tell him that she felt perfectly healthy since taking thyroid, and he told her to stop taking it, because people who have MS need a lot of rest, and she wouldn't get enough rest if she was living in a normally active way. The assumption seemed to be that the diagnosis was more important than the person. (When I refer to a \"thyroid supplement\" I mean one that contains some T3.  Many people experience \"neurological symptoms\" when they take thyroxine by itself.  Experimentally, it has been found to suppress brain respiration, probably by diluting the T3 that was already present in the brain tissue.)METABOLISM OF THE OLIGODENDROCYTESThe rate-regulating step in steroid synthesis involves the entry of cholesterol into the mitochondria, where the heme-enzyme P-450scc then removes the side-chain of cholesterol  (by introducing oxygen atoms), to produce pregnenolone.  This enzyme can be poisoned by carbon monoxide or cyanide, and light can eliminate the poison (15); this could be one aspect of the winter-sickness problem.Peripheral nerves are myelinated by essentially the same sort of cell that is called an oligodendrocyte in the brain, but outside the brain it is called a Schwann cell.  It is easier to study the myelin sheath in peripheral nerves, and the electrical activity of a nerve is the most easily studied aspect of its physiology.  Certain experiments seemed to indicate a \"jumping\" (saltatory) kind of conduction along the nerve between Schwann cells, and it was argued that the insulating function of the myelin sheath made this kind of conduction possible.  This idea has become a standard item in physiology textbooks, and its familiarity leads many people to assume that the presence of myelin sheaths in the brain serves the same \"insulating\" function.For a long time it has been known that heat production during nerve conduction reveals a more continuous mode of  conduction, that doesn't conform to the idea of an electrical  current jumping around an insulator.  Even if the myelin functioned primarily to produce \"saltatory conduction\" in peripheral nerves, it isn't clear how this process could function in the brain.  I think of the issue of \"saltatory conduction at the nodes of Ranvier\" as another of the fetish ideas that have served to obstruct progress in biology in the United States.  A more realistic approach to nerve function can be found in Gilbert Ling's work.  Ling has demonstrated in many ways that the ruling dogma of \"cell membrane\" function isn't coherently based on fact.  He found that hormones such as progesterone regulate the energetic and structural stability of cells.  Many people, unaware of his work, have felt that it was necessary to argue against the idea that there are anesthetic steroids with generalized protective functions, because of their commitment to a textbook dogma of \"cell membrane\" physiology.I think the myelinating cells do have relevance to nerve conduction, but I don't think they serve primarily as electrical insulators.  If the adrenal cortex were inside the heart, it would be obvious to ask whether its hormones aren't important for the heart's function.  Since the oligodendrocytes are steroid-synthesizers, it seems obvious to ask whether their production of pregnenolone in response to stress or fatigue isn't relevant to the conduction processes of the nerves they surround.OLD AGEA biologist friend of mine who was about 85 became very senile.  His wife started giving him thyroid, progesterone, DHEA and pregnenolone, and within a few days his mental clarity had returned.  He continued to be mentally active until he was 89, when his wife interfered with his access to the hormones.In old age the brain steroids fall to about 5% of their level in youth.  Pregnenolone and DHEA improve memory in old rats, and improve mood stability and mental clarity of old people.  Pregnenolone's action in improving the sense of being able to cope with challenges probably reflects a quieting and coordinating of the \"sequencing\" apparatus of the forebrain, which is the area most sensitive to energy deprivation.  This is the area that malfunctions in hyperactive and \"dyslexic\" children.  Weakening of the sequencing and sorting processes probably explains the common old-age inability to extract important sounds from environmental noise, creating a kind of \"confusion deafness.\"  Insomnia, worry and \"restless legs\" at bedtime are problems for many old people, and I think they are variations of the basic energy-depletion problem.The oligodendrocytes were reported (Hiroisi and Lee, 1936) to be the source of the senile plaques or amyloid deposits of Alzheimer's disease.(16)  Hiroisi and Lee showed the cells in different stages of degeneration, ending with translucent \"mucoid\" spots that stained the same as amyloid, the material in the senile plaques.  This type of cell also appears to form a halo or crown around degenerating nerve cells--possibly in a protective reaction to provide the nerve cell  with any pregnenolone the oligodendrocytes are able to make.  The  oligodendrocytes, the source of the brain steroids (that people previously believed came from the adrenals and gonads, and were just stored in the brain), myelinate nerve fibers under the  influence of thyroid hormone (17).  Thyroid is responsible for both myelination and hormone formation.  In old age, glial cells become more numerous, and nerve cells become structurally  and functionally abnormal, but usually there is no problem  with the formation of myelin.  In MS, the problem is just with  myelination, and there are no senile plaques or defects in the  nerve cells themselves.These differences suggest the possibility that Alzheimer's  disease involves a specific premature loss of brain pregnen-  olone production, but not of thyroid.  Recent work suggests a central role for pregnenolone and progesterone in the regulation of consciousness (18), and possibly in the brain's detoxifying system.  Elsewhere, I have suggested that vitamin A deficiency might cause the excessive production of the \"amyloid\" protein.  A vitamin A deficiency severely inhibits steroid synthesis.  (It is used so massively in steroid synthesis that a progesterone supplement can prevent the symptoms of vitamin A deficiency.)  I suspect that vitamin A is necessary for the side-chain cleavage that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone.  Iron-stimulated lipid peroxidation is known to block steroid formation, and vitamin A is very susceptible to destruction  by iron and oxidation.  Iron tends to accumulated in tissues  with aging.  Gajdusek has demonstrated that brain deterioration  is associated with the retention of whatever metal happens to be abundant in the person's environment, not just with aluminum.  (One type of glial cell is known for its metal-binding function, causing them to be called \"metallophils.\").  According to Gajdusek, \"calcium and other di- and trivalent elements\" are \"deposited as hydroxyapatites in brain cells\" in brain degeneration of the Alzheimer's type.(19)Even early forms of Alzheimer's disease begin at an age  when the youth-associated steroids have begun to decline. If  MS involves a deficiency of thyroid (or of T3 within the oligodendrocytes, where T3 normally can be made from thyroxine; many things, including protein deficiency, can block the conversion of T4 to T3), those cells would necessarily be deficient in their ability to produce pregenolone, but in  young people the brain would still be receiving a little pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA from the adrenals and gonads.  This relatively abundant youthful supply of hormones would keep most of the body's organs in good condition,  and could keep the bodies of the major brain cells from deteriorating. But if proper functioning of the nerve fibers requires that they be fed a relatively high concentration of pregnenolone from their immediately adjacent neighbors (with the amount increasing during stress and fatigue), then their function would be impaired when they had to depend on the hormones that arrived from the blood stream.For many years it has been recognized that the brain atrophy of \"Alzheimer's disease\" resembles the changes seen in the brain in many other situations:  The traumatic dementia of boxers; toxic dementia; the slow-virus diseases; exposure of the brain to x-rays(20); ordinary old age; and in people with Down's syndrome who die around the age of thirty.In menopause, certain nerve cells have lost their ability to regulate the ovaries, because of prolonged exposure to estrogen (6).  The cells that fail as a result of prolonged estrogen exposure aren't the same cells that fail from prolonged exposure to the glucocorticoids (7), but they have in common the factor of excitatory injury.Since people who experience premature menopause are known to be more likely than average to die prematurely, it is reasonable to view menopause as a model of the aging process. It is now well established that progesterone fails to be produced at the onset of menopause (the first missed period, increased loss of calcium, symptoms such as hot flashes, etc.), and that estrogen continues to be produced at monthly intervals for about four years.  The essential question for aging, in the present context, is why the anesthetic steroids are no longer produced at a rate that allows them to protect tissues, including brain cells, from the excitotoxins.  Using menopause as a model for aging, we can make the question more answerable by asking why progesterone stops being produced.During stress, we are designed not to get pregnant, and the simplest aspect of this is that ACTH, besides stimulating the adrenals to produce stress-related hormones, inhibits the production of progesterone by the ovary.  Other stress-induced factors, such as increased prolactin and decreased thyroid, also inhibit progesterone production.  Stress eventually makes us more susceptible to stress.  Menopause and other landmarks of aging simply represent upward inflections in the rate-of-aging curve.  Individual variations in type of stress, hormonal response and diet, etc., probably govern the nature of the aging process in an individual.The amphetamine-like action of estrogen, which undoubtedly  contributes to the general level of stress and excitotoxic  abuse of nerve cells, is probably the only \"useful\" facet of  estrogen treatment, but a little cocaine might achieve the  same effect with no more harm, possibly less.  The toxicity of catecholamines has been known for over thirty years, and estrogen's stimulating effects are partly the result of its conversion to catechol-estrogens which increase the activity of brain catecholamines.  Estrogen's powerful ability to nullify learning seems never to be mentioned by the people who promote its use.  The importance of a good balance of brain steroids for mood, attention, memory, and reasoning is starting to be recognized, but powerful economic forces militate against its general acceptance.Since the brain is the organ that can allow us to adapt without undergoing stress in the hormonal sense, it is very important to protect its flexibility and to keep its energy level high, so it can work in a relaxed way.  It is the low energy cellular state that leads to the retention of calcium and iron, and to the production of age pigment, and other changes that constitute the vicious circle of aging.  And mental activity that challenges obsession and rigidity might be the most important brain energizer.  Pseudo-optimism, humor-as-therapy, has a certain value, but a deeper optimism involves a willingness to assimilate new information and to change plans accordingly.SUPPLEMENTSNutritional supplements that might help to prevent or correct these brain syndromes include: Vitamin E and  coconut oil; vitamin A; magnesium, sodium; thyroid which  includes T3; large amounts of animal protein, especially  eggs; sulfur, such as magnesium sulfate or flowers of  sulfur, but not to take continuously, because of sulfur's interference with copper absorption; pregnenolone; progesterone if needed.  Bright light, weak in the blue end of the spectrum and with protection against ultraviolet, activates respiratory metabolism and quenches free radicals.  Raw carrot fiber and/or laxatives if needed; charcoal occasionally for gas or bowel  irritation.  Coconut oil serves several purposes.  Its butyric acid is known to increase T3 uptake by glial cells.  It has a general pro-thyroid action, for example by diluting and displacing antithyroid unsaturated oils, its short- and medium-chain fatty acids sustain blood sugar and have antiallergic actions, and it protects mitochondria against stressinjury.P.S.:  In 1979, a woman whose husband was suffering from advanced Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) asked me if I had any ideas for slowing his decline.  I described my suspicion that ALS involved defective metabolism or regulation of testosterone.  In some tissues, testosterone is selectively concentrated to prevent atrophy, and ALS is a disease of middle-age, when hormone regulation often becomes a special problem.  In the late 1970s, there was discussion of a higher incidence of ALS in males, and especially in athletes.  I told her about progesterone's general protective effects, its antagonism to testosterone, and its prevention of atrophy in various tissues.  She decided to ask her doctor to try progesterone for her husband.  Later, I learned that her husband had gone into a very rapid decline immediately after the injection, and died within a week; the physician had given him testosterone, since, he said, \"testosterone and progesterone are both male hormones.\"  Besides making me more aware of the problems patients have in communicating with physicians, this tended to reinforce my feeling that a hormone imbalance is involved in ALS.  Although I haven't written much about testosterone's toxicity, Marian Diamond's work showed that prenatal testosterone is similar to prenatal estrogen, in causing decreased thickness of the cortex of the brain; both of those hormones oppose progesterone's brain-protecting and brain-promoting actions.REFERENCES1)  Z.

Other Cyt P450 enzymes are important for their detoxifying oxidizing action, and some of these are involved in brain metabolism.3.  Glial means \"glue-like,\" and glial cells are mostly spidery-shaped cells that used to be thought of as just connective, supportive cells in the brain.4.  Mitochondria (the \"thread-like bodies\") are the structures in cells which produce most of our metabolic energy by respiration, in response to the thyroid hormones.5.  Mucoid--refers to a mucoprotein, a protein which contains some carbohydrate.  A glycoprotein; usually not intended as a precise term.6.  Myelination.  Myelin is a multilayered enclosure of the axons (the long processes) of nerve cells, composed of proteins and complex lipids, including cholesterol.  The layered material is a flat, thin extension of the cytoplasm of the oligodendroglial cells.7.  Oligodendrocytes are one of the kinds of glial (or neuroglial) cells, and structurally they are unusual in having sheet-like, rather than just thread-like processes; they have a sensitivity (\"receptors\") to stress and valium, and produce pregnenolone when activated.  Under the influence of thyroid hormone, they wrap themselves in thin layers around the conductive parts of nerve cells, leaving a multilayered \"myelin\" coating.  Their absorption of thyroid hormone is promoted by butyrate, an anti-stress substance found in butter and coconut oil.8.  Steroidogenesis is the creation of steroids, usually referring to the conversion of cholesterol to hormones.© Ray Peat Ph.D. 2013.

Yu, in \"Selective increase in type II estrogen-binding sites in the dysplastic dorsolateral prostates of Noble rats,\" Cancer Research 53, 528-532, 1993.=============================Prostate CancerIt was noticed several decades ago that estrogen causes the prostate gland to enlarge in experimental animals, but by then an oversimplified view of the sex hormones was already well established, that led people to say that \"estrogen causes the female organs to grow, and testosterone causes the male organs to grow.\"  Logically extending this mistaken idea led many of the same people to suppose that the \"hormones of one sex would inhibit the growth of the reproductive organs of the other sex.\"When a friend of mine was told he had prostate cancer, though he had had no symptoms, and should receive large doses of estrogen, I reviewed the literature, to see whether his doctor might have seen something I had neglected.  Since that time, I have found it necessary to use quotation marks around the phrases \"medical research\" and \"medical science,\" because there is a certain kind of \"research\" performed within the medical profession which is peculiar to that profession.When I read through the studies cited by the current articles as the basis for using estrogen to treat prostate cancer, I saw that the decisive \"research\" had consisted of mailing a questionnaire to physicians asking them if they thought it was reasonable to administer estrogen to these patients on the basis of its opposition to testosterone, which was considered to be responsible for the growth of the prostate gland.  Many physicians answered the questionnaire affirmatively.If the questioner's purpose was to determine his legal status in using a treatment, his research method was appropriate, to see whether the treatment seemed reasonable to others in the profession.  Legally, a physician is safe if he can count on others to testify that his practice is standard.  Unfortunately, for generations his study of the opinions of his peers became the \"evidence\" of the value of the estrogen treatment.  Phrases such as \"it is indicated,\" \"treatment of choice,\" and \"standard practice\" are used in medicine, as part of the pseudo-scientific mystique of the profession.  Physicans who attempt to base their practice on methods that have a sound scientific basis are likely to find that they are violating the norms of their profession.More than 25 years ago, when I started pointing out that deliberate misrepresentation had been involved in the continued designation of estrogen as \"the female hormone,\" used as a basis for \"hormone replacement therapies,\" I saw that it was hard for people to sustain a critical attitude toward language.  Language is prior to judgment, law, science, reason.  Those who define the terms set the rules.By the mid-1980s, some studies had shown that estrogen treatment didn't prolong the survival of prostate cancer patients at all, but it was argued that the patients who received estrogen were happier than those who didn't.Apparently, many physicians who were experts in conventional cancer treatment hadn't been impressed by the happiness of their patients who were receiving estrogen, because a survey at a conference of physicians found that many of them would choose to have no treatment if they learned they had prostate cancer.  And more recently, there have been recommendations that older patients shouldn't be treated aggressively, because their cancers are usually so slow growing that they are likely to die of something else related to old age.In spite of the articles I showed my friend, and my warning that estrogen can cause strokes and heart attacks, he decided to take the estrogen treatment.  Within a few days he began suffering from asthma and disturbed sleep.  Then he had a series of strokes and died.Since it was known that estrogen treatment was dangerous for men, and that it increases blood clotting and vascular spasms, there had to be some overriding belief that led to its general use in treating prostate cancer.  That belief seems to be that \"estrogen, the female hormone, opposes testosterone, the male hormone, which is responsible for the growth--and therefore for the cancerization--of the prostate gland.\"  Everything is wrong with that sentence, but you can find every part of the belief present and functioning in the medical literature.  Just to give some context to the association of growth and cancerization, I should mention that Otto Warburg observed that all of the carcinogenic factors he studied causedtissue atrophy before cancerappeared.  Another important contextual point is that every hormone doesmanythings, and every endocrine gland produces multiple hormones.Since the time of Brown-Sequard and Eugen Steinach, it has been accepted that declining testicular function is a common feature of aging, and testosterone was probably the first hormone that was clearly found to decrease consistently with aging.  (Vermeulen, et al., 1972, 1979.)It has seemed odd to many people that enlargement of the prostate should occur mainly in older men, if testosterone is the hormone that causes its growth, and estrogen is antagonistic to its growth.  The nature of the growth of the old man's prostate is very different from its natural growth in youth.It was also recognized decades ago that estrogen rises in men during old age (Pirke and Doerr, 1975), as it rises in stress, disease, malnutrition, and hypothyroidism (which are also associated with old age).  Estrogen is produced in fat (Siiteri, and MacDonald, 1973, Vermeulen, 1976) which tends to increase with age, when thyroid and progesterone are deficient.  The conversion of testosterone to estrogen occurs in the testicle itself, but this conversion is also inhibited by the favorable hormonal environment of youth.The active thyroid hormone, T3,declines with aging, and this necessarily lowers production of pregnenolone and progesterone.  Increasingly, in both sexes, it appears that DHEA may rise during stress as a result of a deficiency of thyroid, progesterone, and pregnenolone.In 1786, John Hunter reported that castration causes a decrease in the size of the prostate gland, and by the end of the 19th century castration was being advocated for treating enlargement of the prostate.  In aging men, the prostate gland (both central and peripheral zones) atrophies, and it is within the atrophic gland that cancer cells can be found.  Nodular, noncancerous enlargement may occur, with or without cancer.  In 1935, an autopsy study showed carcinoma in the prostates of 30% of men by the age of 50.  Proliferation of ductal and epithelial tissue is closely associated with prostate cancer, a situation similar to that of the cancerous or precancerous breast.  (Simpson, et al., 1982; Wellings, et al., 1975; Jensen, et al., 1976.)  The high probability of \"epitheliosis\" in association with cancer was seen in women in their early 40s, and in women over 60. (Simpson, et al.)  (Epitheliosis just refers to an exaggerated proliferation of epithelial cells, the cells covering all surfaces, including the lining of glands, and things as simple as irritation and vitamin A deficiency can cause these cells to proliferate.)  In the breast, the proliferative epitheliosis is clearly caused by estrogenic stimulation.  The antagonism between estrogen and vitamin A in controlling epithelial proliferation (and possibly other cell types:Boettger-Tong and Stancel, 1995) is clear wherever it has been tested;vitamin A restrains epithelial proliferation.  (Wherever estrogen is a factor in the development of abnormal tissue, vitamin A supplementation would seem beneficial.)In aging women and men, as the breasts and prostate atrophy, their estrogen/antiestrogen ratio increases.In men with prostate cancer, the fluid secreted by the prostate contains significantly more estradiol than the fluid from men without cancer (Rose, et al., 1984).  This is analogous to observations made in women with breast cancer.The pituitary hormones have diverse functons, including effects on epithelial tissues, other than their \"classical\" functions.  Growth hormone, ACTH (Lostroh and Li, 1957), and ACTH with prolactin (Tullner, 1963) stimulate prostate growth.  Prolactin--which is increased by estrogen--stimulates growth of the rat's lateral prostate (Holland and Lee, 1980), and stimulates the growth of human prostate epithelial cellsin vitro(Syms, et al., 1985).  LH (luteinizing hormone) increases when progesterone or testosterone is deficient, and growth hormone and prolactin (which are closely associated in evolution) both increase under a variety of stressful situations, and with estrogenic stimulation.Prostate cancer patients who had higher levels of LH andlower testosteronedied most quickly.  (Harper, et al., 1984.)  Also, ahigh ratio of testosterone to estradiol or of testosterone to prolactincorresponded to better survival (Rannikko, et al., 1981.)  Considered separately, patients withhigher testosterone levels had a better prognosisthan those with lower levels, and patients with lower growth hormonelevels did better than those with higher growth hormone levels. (Wilson, et al., 1985.)  Has anyone ever tried testosterone therapy for prostate cancer?  Or, more practically, a generalized antiestrogenic therapy, using thyroid, progesterone, and pregnenolone?  Other drugs (naloxone, bromocriptine, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, and anti-growth hormone druges, e.g.) are available to regulate the pituitary hormones, and might be useful therapeutically or preventively.  (See Blaakaer, et al., 1995.)  Biskind and Biskind's work (1944) with ovarian tumors might be relevant to both testicular and prostate cancer.Abnormal patterns of pituitary hormones reflect stress and hormonal imbalance, but they are also directly involved in widespread changes in tissue content of glycoproteins.  The prostate is specialized to secrete large amounts of mucin.  The endocrine physiology of prostate mucin secretion is poorly understood, but it is likely that there are interactions between growth-regulatory and secretion-regulatory systems.In recent years, prostate cancer has been one of the fastest increasing kinds of cancer, and it isn't apparent that increased treatment has had an effect in lowering the death rate.  The postwar baby-boom (following the baby-bust of the great depression) created an abnormal age-structure of the population, that has been used to argue that the war against cancer is being won.  Increasing environmental estrogens are known to cause many reproductive abnormalities, and their contribution to prostate cancer would get more attention if estrogen's role in prostate disease were better known.  Environmental estrogens are clearly responsible for genital deformities and sterility in many species of wild animals, but when the causal link is made between estrogens and human abnormalities, the estrogen industry sends its shills in to create controversy and confusion.  Even the effects of estrogens in sewage, known for decades, are treated as State Secrets:  \"There had been reports of hermaphroditic fishes in one or two rivers, and government investigators had been studying them since the late 1970s.But no one had been aware of the work because it was classified.\"(Lutz, 1996.)Testicular cancer is easy to diagnose, and its incidence has clearly increased (100% in white men, 200% in black men) since 1950.  Undescended testicles, urethral abnormalities, etc., similar to those seen in DES sons and in wild animals, have also increased.  So the tremendous increase in the death rate from prostate cancer during the same time has a meaningful context.Although the animal studies showed that estrogen treatment promotes enlargement of the prostate, it was possible to suppose that the human prostate's growth might be stimulated only by testosterone, until tests were donein vitroto determine the effects of hormones on cell division.In human prostate slices, several hormones (including insulin, and probably prolactin) stimulated cell division;testosterone did not,under these experimental conditions. (McKeehan, et al., 1984.) Contrary to the stereotyped ideas, there are suggestions that supplementary androgens could control prostate cancer (Umekita, et al., 1996), and that antagonists to prolactin and estrogen might be appropriately used in hormonal therapy (for example, Wennbo, et al., 1997; Lane, et al., 1997).By the age of 50, men often show an excess of both prolactin and estrogen, and a deficiency of thyroid and testosterone.  This is the age at which enlargement of the prostate often becomes noticeable.Estrogen's role in prostate growth and cancerization is clear:\"...simultaneous treatment of intact...rats with testosterone and estradiol-17beta for 16 weeks consistenly induced a putative precancerous lesion, termed dysplasia, in the dorsolateral prostate of all animals.  Since treatment of rats with androgen alone did not elicit the same response, we concluded that estrogen played a critical role in the genesis of this proliferative lesion.\"  (Ho and Yu.)Progesterone and pregnenolone also decline in aging men.  Several studies using synthetic progestins have shown that they effectively shrink the hypertrophic prostate, and the saw palmetto remedy for prostate enlargement has been reported to contain pregnenolone, or something similar to it.  These materials might be expected to reduce conversion of testosterone or other androgens to estrogen.The prostaglandins were discovered in prostatic fluid, where they occur in significant concentrations.  They are so deeply involved with the development of cancers of all sorts that aspirin and other prostaglandin inhibitors should be considered as a basic part of cancer therapy.  The prostaglandins have local and systemic effects that promote cancer growth.  (\"The prostaglandins and related eicosanoids synthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acid precursors have been implicated as modulators oftumor metastasis, host immunoregulation, tumor promotion, and cell proliferation.\"Hubbard, et al., 1988.)Estrogens cause elevation of free fatty acids, and  there are many interactions between the unsaturated fatty acids and estrogen, including their metabolism to prostaglandins, and their peroxidation.  Estrogen's roles as free-radical promoter, DNA toxin, carcinogen, tumor promotor, modifier of tissue growth factors, anti-thymic hormone, etc., as well as its local effects on the prostate gland, have to be kept in mind.  Most of the interest in studying estrogen's contributions to prostate cancer relates to the existence of estrogen receptors in various parts of the prostate.  While that is interesting, it tends to distract attention from the fact that many of estrogen's most important actions don't involve the \"receptors.\"  Adirect excitatoryaction on prostate cells, andindirectactions by way of the pituitary, pancreas, thyroid, adrenal, fatty acids, prostaglandins, histamine and circulation are probably essential parts of the cancerization process.The unsaturated fatty acids, but not the saturated fatty acids, free estrogen from the serum proteins that bind it, and increase its availability and activity in tissue cells.Thyroid supplementation, adequate animal protein, trace minerals, and vitamin A are the first things to consider in the prevention of prostate hypertrophy and cancer.  Nutritional and endocrine support can be combined with rational anticancer treatments, since there is really no sharp line between different approaches that are aimed at achieving endocrine and immunological balance, without harming anything.Avoiding tissue atrophy is very closely related to promoting healthy regeneration.  These processes require efficient energy production, and an appropriate balance between stimulation and resources.  Growth hormone is sometimes recommend to correct tissue atrophy, but the evidence seems reasonably clear that it is a factor in the promotion of tumefaction of the prostate.  The only study I have seen suggesting that it might be beneficial in prostatic cancer was a 14 day experiment done in female rats.  Numerous publications suggest that blocking growth hormone is beneficial in treating prostate cancer;in future newsletters I will be discussing the evidence that growth hormone, like estrogen, cortisol, and unsaturated fats, tends to promote degenerative changes of aging -Growth hormone: Hormone of Stress, Aging, and Death?REFERENCESM.C.

Dysplasia, a pre-neoplastic lesion, develops specifically in the dorsolateral prostates (DLPs) of NBL rats treated for 16 weeks with a combined regimen of testosterone (T) and estradiol-17beta (E2) (T + E2-treated rats).Concurrent with DLP dysplasia induction, the dual hormone regimen also elicits hyperprolactinemia, in addition to an elevation of nuclear type II estrogen binding sites (type II EBS), no alteration in estrogen receptors (ER), and marked epithelial cell proliferation in the dysplastic foci.The aim of this study was to investigate whether the dual hormone action is mediated via E2-induced hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine (Br), at a dose of 4 mg/kg body wt per day, was used to suppress pituitary prolactin (PRL) release. Serum PRL levels were lowered from values of 341 +/- 50 ng/ml in T + E2-treated rats to 32 +/- 10 ng/ml in Br co-treated animals. The latter values were comparable to those in untreated control rats. In addition, Br co-treatment effectively inhibited the evolution of dysplasia (six out of eight rats)and the often associated inflammation(five out of eight rats) in most animals. In contrast, Br co-treatment did not suppress the T + E2-induced type II EBS elevation nor alter ER levels in the DLPs of these rats, when compared with T + E2-treated rats. These data extend the many previous studies that have detailed marked influences ofPRL on rat prostatic functions.

        "chunk_html": "Growth hormone: Hormone of Stress, Aging, & Death?The name \"growth hormone\" is misleading; stress produces somatic growth, in a process called \"hormesis.\" Exercise produces muscle edema, to a degree similar to that produced by GH; edema stimulates growth, but GH effect isn't limited to bone and muscle.Identity of GH: Molecular ambiguity, complex modifications change one substance into many; its evolution suggests a role in water regulation. Doctrine of a \"specific molecule\" and \"specific receptor\" and specific effects is a myth.The osmoregulatory problem--keeping water under control--is centrally involved in stress.In mammals, the kidneys and bowel are the main regulators of water balance.GH is a stress hormone. Its effects can be produced osmotically, for example inducing milk production and cartilage growth, by osmotic (dilution) shock.Estrogen produces increased GH, and increases its production in stress.Nitric oxide is a pro-aging free radical induced by estrogen, releasing GH; all three produce edema.Behind edema, hypoxia, hypocarbia; free fatty acids, diabetes, vascular leakiness, degenerative kidney changes, connective tissue changes, thickened.basement membrane, retinal degeneration. The same changes occur in aging: increased permeability; kidney disease, connective tissue changes.The absence of GH protects kidneys against degeneration. Osteoarthritis, a characteristic aging condition, is caused by estrogen and GH.Some studies found that heart failure and bone repair aren't improved by GH; GH is very high during heart failure, in which edema contributes to the problem; carpal tunnel syndrome, myalgia, tumor growth, gynecomastia, and many other problems have been produced by GH treatments.=====================================Bovine Growth Hormone is used to make cows give more milk.Human Growth Hormone is supposed to make men lean and muscular, not to increase their milk production.=====================================Recently I heard Robert Sapolsky interviewed, and he was describing the changes that prepare the body for short-term stress. He said the energy-mobilizing hormones, adrenalin and cortisol, increase, while the hormones that don't contribute to meeting the immediate problem, including the sex hormones and growth hormone, are suppressed, to save energy; growth and reproductive processes can be suspended for the few minutes of acute stress, to make the body more able to meet its acute needs. He reiterated: Growth hormone is suppressed by stress.Sapolsky has done very interesting work on the suppression of testosterone by stress, and on the way in which brain cells are killed by prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids. He showed that if extra glucose is supplied, the brain cells can survive their exposure to cortisol. In the body, adrenalin and the glucocorticoids increase the availability of glucose.In the radio interview, he didn't have time for much detail, but it seemed to me that he wasn't talking about the same growth hormone that I have been reading about, and trying to understand, for years. Since people have asked me to write about the current anti-aging uses of GH, and its use in the dairy industry, Sapolsky's statements made me decide to think about some of the issues around the hormone.*________________________________________________________________________________*If Sapolsky had been talking about just mice and rats, his statement would have been generally accurate. Adrenaline stimulates rat pituitary cells to secrete GH, and since both increase the amount of free circulating fatty acids, it could be that rats' GH is suppressed by a fatty acid excess.The \"growth hormone\" was named long before it was actually found, and the substance with that name turns out to be involved in many processes other than growth. It is being given to cows to make them produce more milk, and it is being given to people with the purpose of making them lean and muscular, and with the hope of building stronger bones.It isn't surprising that the Growth Hormone helps breasts develop and promotes milk production, since it is very similar to prolactin. GH and prolactin are members of a family of proteins that have diverged from each other in evolution, but they still have many overlapping effects.When GH is treated as a drug, it is supposed to have a discrete identity, based on the sequence of its amino acids. But the natural hormone (disregarding the existence of a variety of closely related peptides with slightly different amino acid composition) varies with time, being chemically modified even before it is secreted. For example, its acidic amino acids may be methylated, and its lysine groups may combine with sugars or carbon dioxide. The history of the protein in the body determines its exact structure, and therefore its biological effects.Male animals secrete GH in pulses, but females secrete it more steadily. This pattern of secretion \"masculinizes\" or \"feminizes\" the liver (and other organs), determining the pattern of enzyme activity. It would be possible (though very difficult) to arrange a system for delivering doses in a pulsed, intermittent manner. In cows, this apparently isn't necessary, since the purpose of the growth hormone is presumably to \"feminize\" the milk-producing system. But the normal pattern of secretion is much more complex than simply being \"pulsed\" or \"continuous,\" since it, like prolactin secretion, is responsive to changes in thyroid, estrogen, diet, stress, and many other factors.For example, hormones in this family are, as far back in evolution as they have been studied, involved in the regulation of water and minerals. It is well established that increased water (hypotonicity) stimulates prolactin, and increased sodium inhibits its secretion. Growth hormone is also closely involved with the regulation of water and salts.One of the best known metabolic effects of GH is that, like adrenalin, it mobilizes fatty acids from storage. GH is known to antagonize insulin, and one of the ways it does this is simply by the ability of increased free fatty acids to block the oxidation of glucose. At puberty, the increased GH creates a mild degree of diabetes-like insulin resistance, which tends to increase progressively with age.In his book, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, Sapolsky acknowledges some situations in which GH is increased by stress in humans, but I think he misses the real ways in which it operates in stress. One of the interesting features of cortisol, which Sapolsky showed killed brain cells by making them unable to use glucose efficiently, is that it makes cells take up unsaturated fatty acids more easily, interfering with their energy production. Since growth hormone also has this kind of \"diatebetogenic\" action, it might be desirable to suppress its secretion during stress, but in fact, there are several kinds of stress that clearly increase its secretion, and in animals as different as fish, frogs, cows, and people it can be seen to play roles in water and salt regulation, growth and development, stress, and starvation.Heat, hypoglycemia, running, and some types of shock are known to stimulate growth hormone secretion, sometimes to levels ten or twenty times higher than normal. (Two kinds of stress that usually don't increase GH are cold and stimulus-deprivation.) I consider the growth hormone to be, almost as much as prolactin, a stress-inducible hormone. That's why I reasoned that, if an endocrinologist as good as Sapolsky can misunderstand GH to that degree, the public is even more likely to misunderstand the nature of the material, and to believe that it somehow acts just on muscle, fat, and bones.And the normally functioning pituitary appears to be unnecessary to grow to normal height. (Kageyama, et al., 1998.)W. D. Denckla discovered that the pituitary hormones are in some way able to accelerate the process of aging. They block the actions of thyroid hormone, decreasing the ability to consume oxygen and produce energy. The diabetes-like state that sets in at puberty involves the relative inability to metabolize glucose, which is an oxygen-efficient energy source, and a shift to fat oxidation, in which more free radicals are produced, and in which mitochondrial function is depressed. Diabetics, even though it is supposedly an inability of their cells to absorb glucose that defines their disease, habitually waste glucose, producing lactic acid even when they aren't \"stressed\" or exerting themselves enough to account for this seemingly anaerobic metabolism. It was noticing phenomena of this sort, occurring in a great variety of animal species, in different phyla, that led Denckla to search for what he called DECO (decreasing consumption of oxygen) or \"the death hormone.\" (Vladimir Dilman noticed a similar cluster of events, but he consistently interpreted everything in terms of a great genetic program, and he offered no solution beyond a mechanistic treatment of the symptoms.)Simply increasing the amount of free fatty acids in the blood will act like DECO or \"the death hormone,\" but growth hormone has more specific metabolic effects than simply increasing our cells' exposure to fatty acids. The hormone creates a bias toward oxidizing of the most unsaturated fatty acids (Clejan and Schulz), in a process that appears to specifically waste energy.Growth hormone plays an important role in puberty, influencing ovarian function, for example.Removing animals' pituitaries, Denckla found that their aging was drastically slowed. He tried to isolate the death hormone from pituitary extracts. He concluded that it wasn't prolactin, although prolactin had some of its properties. In the last publication of his that I know of on that subject, he reported that he was unable to isolate the death hormone, but that it was \"in the prolactin fraction.\" Since rats have at least 14 different peptides in their prolactin family, not counting the multitude of modifications that can occur depending on the exact conditions of secretion, it isn't surprising that isolating a single factor with exactly the properties of the chronically functioning aging pituitary hasn't been successful.Denckla's experiments are reminiscent of many others that have identified changes in pituitary function as driving forces in aging and degenerative diseases.Menopause, for example, is the result of overactivity of the pituitary gonatropins, resulting from the cumulatively toxic effects of estrogen in the hypothalamus.A. V. Everitt, in his book on the hypothalamus and pituitary in aging, reported on studies in which estrogen caused connective tissues to lose their elasticity, and in which progesterone seemed to be an antiestrogenic longevity factor. Later, he did a series of experiments that were very similar to Denckla's, in which removal of the pituitary slowed the aging process. Several of his experiments strongly pointed to the prolactin-growth hormone family as the aging factors. Removal of the pituitary caused retardation of aging similar to food restriction. These pituitary hormones, especially prolactin, are very responsive to food intake, and the growth hormone is involved in the connective tissue and kidney changes that occur in diabetes and aging.A mutant dwarf mouse, called \"little,\" has only 5% to 10% as much growth hormone as normal mice, and it has an abnormally long lifespan.Many experiments show that prolactin and estrogen have synergistic effects in causing tissue degeneration, including cancerization, and that their effects tend to operate with fewer protective restraining influences in old age. Estrogen stimulates both prolactin and growth hormone secretion. Thirty years ago, people were warning that estrogen contraceptives might produce diabetes, because they caused chronic elevation of growth hormone and free fatty acids.Since estrogen causes a slight tendency to retain water while losing sodium, producing hypotonic body fluids, and since hypotonicity is a sufficient stimulus to cause prolactin secretion, I have proposed that it is estrogen's effect on the body fluids which causes it to stimulate prolactin. In pregnancy, the fetus is exposed to fluids more hypotonic than can be accounted for by estrogen and prolactin alone; since GH lowers the salt concentration of fish when they enter the ocean from freshwater, it seems to be a candidate for this effect in pregnancy.Growth itself is an intrinsic property of all cells, but the growth hormone does have its greatest influence on certain tissues, especially cartilage. Gigantism and acromegaly were what originally made people interested in looking for a growth hormone, and these are characterized by continued, exaggerated enlargement of bones and cartilage. In old age, cartilaginous structures such as the bones and ears keep enlarging. The fact that simply diluting the culture medium is sufficient to stimulate the growth of cartilage suggests that the growth hormone might be acting by its effects on water metabolism. In fish which enter fresh water from the ocean, pituitary hormones of this family help them to balance salts in this new environment, but in the process, they develop osteoporosis and skeletal deformity, of the sort that occur more gradually in other animals with aging.Growth hormone clearly causes edema, and this is probably involved in the pathological processes that it can produce. The expansion of extracellular water has been reported, but others have concluded that the increased weight of muscles following GH treatment must be the result of \"growth,\" \"because microscopic examination didn't show edema.\" Statements of that sort give incompetence a bad name, because any student of biology or biochemistry has to know, before he does almost any experiment, that the way to determine the water content of a tissue is to compare the wet weight to the weight after thorough drying. Looking for water under a microscope is the sort of thing they do at drug companies to pretend that they have done something.Estrogen, growth hormone, and nitric oxide, which tend to work as a system, along with free fatty acids, all increase the permeability of blood vessels. The leaking of albumin into the urine, which is characteristic of diabetes, is promoted by GH. In diabetes and GH treatment, the basement membrane, the jelly-like material that forms a foundation for capillary cells, is thickened. The reason for this isn't known, but it could be a compensatory\"anti-leak\" response tending to reduce the leakage of proteins and fats.Besides being involved in kidney degeneration, vascular leakiness contributes to brain edema, and probably contributes to the \"autoimmune\" diseases.Whatever the exact mechanism may be, it is clearly established that GH contributes to kidney degereration, and the lack of GH, even the removal of the pituitary, is protective against kidney degeneration.Denckla's and Everitt's experiments can be interpreted much more clearly now that GH's essential contribution to kidney degeneration is known. Growth Hormone may not be precisely the Death Hormone that Denckla was looking for, but it is very close to it. Anti-thyroid effects have been seen, and possibly even anti-growth effects during gestation, and in kidney disease. In newborns, high GH is associated with smaller size and slower growth; in one study, this was associated wtith rapid breathing, presumably hyperventilation which is associated with stress. The shift to the diabetes-like fatty acid oxidation would be expected to inhibit respiration, and the chronic elevation of serum free fatty acids will have a generalized antithyroid effect. Under the influence of GH, the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids is increased, as occurs under the influence of estrogen.Growth hormone blocks gonadotropin-stimulated progesterone production, and this could also affect thyroid and respiratory metabolism.The increase of GH during sleep might seem to be utterly incompatible with the idea that it is a stress hormone, but in fact the other stress hormones, adrenalin, cortisol, and prolactin also tend to increase during night-time sleep. Thyroid function and progesterone function decrease at night. As I have argued previously darkness is one of our major stressors. Considering GH's tendency to cause edema, tissue swelling, it could play a role in the nocturnal increase of the viscosity of blood, as the volume of blood is decreased by the leakage of fluid into the tissues. Another process with potentially deadly results that increase withaging and stress, is the passage of bacteria from the intestine into the blood stream; this process is increased under the influence of GH.Acute, short term studies definitely show growth hormone to be a stress hormone with some destabilizing effects. Over a lifetime, it is possible that such things as chronically increased levels of unsaturated fatty acids in the blood, and increased leakiness of the blood vessels, could cumulatively produce the effects that Denckla ascribed to the Death Hormone.REFERENCESIntern Med 1998 May;37(5):472-5.

Sodium retention and symptoms and signs of fluid retention are commonly recorded during GH administration in both GH-deficient patients and normal subjects. Most reports have however, been casuistic or uncontrolled. In a randomized double blind placebo-controlled cross-over study we therefore examined the effect of 14-day GH administration (12 IU sc at 2000 h) on plasma volume, extracellular volume (ECV), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), arginine vasopressin, and the renin angiotensin system in eight healthy adult men. A significant GH induced increase in serum insulin growth factor I was observed. GH caused a significant increase in ECV (L): 20.45 +/- 0.45 (GH), 19.53 +/- 0.48 (placebo) (P less than 0.01), whereas plasma volume (L) remained unchanged 3.92 +/- 0.16 (GH), 4.02 +/- 0.13 (placebo). A significant decrease in plasma ANP (pmol/L) after GH administration was observed: 2.28 +/- 0.54 (GH), 3.16 +/- 0.53 (placebo) P less than 0.01. Plasma aldosterone (pmol/L): 129 +/- 14 (GH), 89 +/- 17 (placebo), P = 0.08, and plasma angiotensin II (pmol/L) levels: 18 +/- 12 (GH), 14 +/- 7 (placebo), P = 0.21, were not significantly elevated. No changes in plasma arginine vasopressin occurred (1.86 +/- 0.05 pmol/L vs. 1.90 +/- 0.05, P = 0.33). Serum sodium and blood pressure remained unaffected. Moderate complaints, which could be ascribed to water retention, were recorded in four subjects [periorbital edema (n = 3), acral paraesthesia (n = 2) and light articular pain (n = 1)]. The symptoms were most pronounced after 2-3 days of treatment and diminished at the end of the period. In summary, 14 days of high dose GH administration caused a significant increase in ECV and a significant suppression of ANP.Circulation 1991 Jun;83(6):1880-7.

The pathogenesis of sodium and water accumulation in chronic constrictive pericarditis is not well understood and may differ from that in patients with chronic congestive heart failure due to myocardial disease. This study was undertaken to investigate some of the mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using standard techniques, the hemodynamics, water and electrolyte spaces, renal function, and plasma concentrations of hormones were measured in 16 patients with untreated constrictive pericarditis and were measured again in eight patients after pericardiectomy. The average hemodynamic measurements were as follows: cardiac output, 1.98 l/min/m2; right atrial pressure, 22.9 mm Hg; pulmonary wedge pressure, 24.2 mm Hg; and mean pulmonary artery pressure 30.2 mm Hg. The systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances (36.3 +/- 2.5 and 3.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg.min.m2/l, respectively) were increased. Significant increases occurred in total body water (36%), extracellular volume (81%), plasma volume (53%), and exchangeable sodium (63%). The renal plasma flow was only moderately decreased (49%), and the glomerular filtration rate was normal. Significant increases also occurred in plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (3.6 times normal), renin activity (7.2 time normal), aldosterone (3.4 times normal), cortisol (1.4 times normal), growth hormone (21.8 times normal), and atrial natriuretic peptide (5 times normal).\" \"The arterial pressure is maintained more by the expansion of the blood volume than by an increase in the peripheral vascular resistance.\"J Clin Endocrinol Metab 1991 Apr;72(4):768-72 Expansion of extracellular volume and suppression of atrial natriuretic peptide after growth hormone administration in normal man.

Everitt AV, Wyndham JR, Barnard DL Hypophysectomy in young male Wistar rats aged 70 days, like food restriction begun at the same age, retarded the life-long rate of collagen aging in tail tendon fibres and inhibited the development of age-associated proteinuria and renal histopathology. Hypothalamic lesions which increased the food intake of hypophysectomized rats from 7 g to 15 g/day and produced obesity did not alter the rate of either collagen aging or proteinuria development, nor reduce life expectancy, but increased the incidence of abnormal glomeruli. In the intact rats elevation of food intake from 7 g to 15 g/day increased the rate of proteinuria development, but did not affect the rate of collagen aging. Hypophysectomy was found to have a greater anti-collagen aging effect than food restriction, when food intakes were the same in both groups. These studies suggest a pituitary-hormonal effect on collagen aging and a food-pituitary-hormone-mediated effect on the development of age-associated proteinuria.Growth Dev Aging 1992 Summer;56(2):85-93.

        "chunk_html": "Phosphate, activation, and agingRecent publications are showing that excess phosphate can increase inflammation, tissue atrophy, calcification of blood vessels, cancer, dementia, and, in general, the processes of aging. This is especially important, because of the increasing use of phosphates as food additives.Previously, the complications of chronic kidney disease, with increased serum phosphate, were considered to be specific for that condition, but the discovery of a phosphate-regulating gene named klotho (after one of the Fates in Greek mythology) has caused a lot of rethinking of the biological role of phosphate. In the 19th century, phosphorus was commonly called brain food, and since about 1970, its involvement in cell regulation has become a focus of reductionist thinking. ATP, adenosine triphosphate, is seen as the energy source that drives cell movement as well as the \"pumps\" that maintain the living state, and as the source of the cyclic AMP that is a general activator of cells, and as the donor of the phosphate group that activates a great number of proteins in the \"phosphorylation cascade.\" When tissues calcified in the process of aging, calcium was blamed (ignoring the existence of calcium phosphate crystals in the tissues), and low calcium diets were recommended. Recently, when calcium supplements haven't produced the intended effects, calcium was blamed, disregarding the other materials present in the supplements, such as citrate, phosphate, orotate, aspartate, and lactate.I have a different perspective on the \"phosphorylation cascade,\" and on the other functions of phosphate in cells, based largely on my view of the role of water in cell physiology. In the popular view, a stimulus causes a change of shape in a receptor protein, causing it to become an active enzyme, catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to another protein, causing it to change shape and become activated, and to transfer phosphate groups to other molecules, or to remove phosphates from active enzymes, in chain reactions. This is standard biochemistry, that can be done in a test tube.Starting around 1970, when the involvement of phosphorylation in the activation of enzymes in glycogen breakdown was already well known, people began noticing that the glycogen phosphorylase enzyme became active immediately when the muscle cell contracted, and that phosphorylation followed the activation. Phosphorylation was involved in activation of the enzyme, but if something else first activated the enzyme (by changing its shape), the addition of the phosphate group couldn't be considered as causal, in the usual reductionist sense. It was one participant in a complex causal process. I saw this as a possible example of the effect of changing water structure on protein structure and function. This view of water questions the relevance of test tube biochemistry.Enzymes are known which suddenly become inactive when the temperature is lowered beyond a certain point. This is because soluble proteins arrange their shape so that their hydrophobic regions, the parts with fat-like side-chains on the amino acids, are inside, with the parts of the chain with water-soluble amino acids arranged to be on the outside, in contact with the water. The \"wetness\" of water, its activity that tends to exclude the oily parts of the protein molecule, decreases as the temperature decreases, and some proteins are destabilized when the relatively hydrophobic group is no longer repelled by the surrounding cooler water.In the living cell, the water is all within a very short distance of a surface of fats or fat-like proteins. In a series of experiments, starting in the 1960s, Walter Drost-Hansen showed that, regardless of the nature of the material, the water near a surface is structurally modified, becoming less dense, more voluminous. This water is more \"lipophilic,\" adapting itself to the presence of fatty material, as if it were colder. This change in the water's properties also affects the solubility of ions, increasing the solubility of potassium, decreasing that of sodium, magnesium, and calcium (Wiggins, 1973).When a muscle contracts, its volume momentarily decreases (Abbott and Baskin, 1962). Under extremely high pressure, muscles contract. In both situations, the work-producing process of contraction is associated with a slight reduction in volume. During contraction of a muscle or nerve, heat is given off, causing the temperature to rise. During relaxation, recovering from excitation, heat is absorbed (Curtin and Woledge, 1974; Westphal, et al., 1999; Constable, et al. 1997). In the case of a nerve, following the heating produced by excitation, the temperature of the nerve decreases below the starting temperature (Abbot, et al., 1965). Stretching a muscle causes energy to be absorbed (Constable, et al., 1997). Energy changes such as these, without associated chemical changes, have led some investigators to conclude that muscle tension generation is \"entropy driven\" (Davis and Rodgers, 1995).Kelvin's description (1858) of the physics of water in a soap bubble, \"…if a film such as a soap-bubble be enlarged . . . it experiences a cooling effect . . . ,\" describes the behavior of nerves and muscles, absorbing energy or heat when they are relaxing (or elongating), releasing it when they are excited/contracting.Several groups of experimenters over the last 60 years have tried to discover what happens to the missing heat; some have suggested electrical or osmotic storage, and some have demonstrated that stretching generates ATP, arguing for chemical storage. Physical storage in the form of structural changes in the water-protein-lipid system, interacting with chemical changes such as ATP synthesis, have hardly been investigated.Early studies of muscle chemistry and contraction found that adding ATP to a viscous solution of proteins extracted from muscle reduced its viscosity, and also that the loss of ATP from muscle caused its hardening, as in rigor mortis; if the pH wasn't too acidic, the dead muscle would contract as the ATP content decreased. Szent-Gyorgyi found that a muscle hardened by rigor mortis became soft again when ATP was added.Rigor mortis is an extreme state of fatigue, or energy depletion. Early muscle studies described the phenomenon of \"fatigue contracture,\" in which the muscle, when it reaches the point at which it stops responding to stimulation, is maximally contracted (this has also been called delayed relaxation). Ischemic contracture, in the absence of blood circulation, occurs when the muscle's glycogen is depleted, so that ATP can no longer be produced anaerobically (Kingsley, et al., 1991). The delayed relaxation of hypothyroid muscle is another situation in which it is clear that ATP is required for relaxation. (In the Achilles tendon reflex test, the relaxation rate is visibly slowed in hypothyroidism.) A delayed T wave in the electrocardiogram, and the diastolic contracture of the failing heart show the same process of delayed relaxation. Supplementing the active thyroid hormone, T3, can quickly restore the normal rate of relaxation, and its beneficial effects have been demonstrated in heart failure (Pingitore, et al., 2008; Wang, et al., 2006; Pantos, et al., 2007; Galli, et al., 2008).A large part of the magnesium in cells is bound to ATP, and the magnesium-ATP complex is a factor in muscle relaxation. A deficiency of either ATP or magnesium contributes to muscle cramping. When a cell is stimulated, causing ATP to release inorganic phosphate, it also releases magnesium. Above the pH of 6.7, phosphate is doubly ionized, in which state it has the same kind of structural effect on water that magnesium, calcium, and sodium have, causing water molecules to be powerfully attracted to the concentrated electrical charge of the ion. Increasing the free phosphate and magnesium opposes the effect of the surfaces of fats and proteins on the water structure, and tends to decrease the solubility of potassium in the water, and to increase the water's \"lipophobic\" tendency to minimize its contacts with fats and the fat-like surface of proteins, causing the proteins to rearrange themselves.These observations relating to the interactions of water, solutes and proteins in muscles and nerves provide a coherent context for understanding contraction and conduction, which is lacking in the familiar descriptions based on membranes, pumps, and cross-bridges, but I think they also provide a uniquely useful context for understanding the possible dangers of an excess of free phosphate in the body.A few people (M. Thomson, J. Gunawardena, A.K. Manrai) are showing that principles of mass-action help to simplify understanding the networks of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation that are involved in cell control. But independently from the phosphorylation of proteins, the presence of phosphate ion in cell water modifies the cell's ion selectivity, shifting the balance toward increased uptake of sodium and calcium, decreasing potassium, tending to depolarize and \"activate\" the cell.About 99% of the publications discussing the mechanism of muscle contraction fail to mention the presence of water, and there's a similar neglect of water in discussions of the energy producing processes in the mitochondrion. The failure of mitochondrial energy production leads to lipid peroxidation, activation of inflammatory processes, and can cause disintegration of the energy producing structure. Increased phosphate decreases mitochondrial energy production (Duan and Karmazyn, 1989), causes lipid peroxidation (Kowaltowski, et al., 1996), and activates inflammation, increasing the processes of tissue atrophy, fibrosis, and cancer.For about twenty years it has been clear that the metabolic problems that cause calcium to be lost from bones cause calcium to increase in the soft tissues, such as blood vessels. The role of phosphate in forming calcium phosphate crystals had until recently been assumed to be passive, but some specific \"mechanistic\" effects have been identified. For example, increased phosphate increases the inflammatory cytokine, osteopontin (Fatherazi, et al., 2009), which in bone is known to activate the process of decalcification, and in arteries is involved in calcification processes (Tousoulis, et al., 2012). In the kidneys, phosphate promotes calcification (Bois and Selye, 1956), and osteopontin, by its activation of inflammatory T-cells, is involved in the development of glomerulonephritis, as well as in inflammatory skin reactions (Yu, et al., 1998). High dietary phosphate increases serum osteopontin, as well as serum phosphate and parathyroid hormone, and increases the formation of tumors in skin (Camalier, et al., 2010).  Besides the activation of cells and cell systems, phosphate (like other ions with a high ratio of charge to size, including citrate) can activate viruses (Yamanaka, et al., 1995; Gouvea, et al., 2006). Aromatase, the enzyme that synthesizes estrogen, is an enzyme that's sensitive to the concentration of phosphate (Bellino and Holben, 1989).More generally, increased dietary phosphate increases the activity of an important regulatory enzyme, protein kinase B, which promotes organ growth. A high phosphate diet increases the growth of liver (Xu, et al., 2008) and lung (Jin, et al., 2007), and promotes the growth of lung cancer (Jin, et al., 2009). An extreme reduction of phosphate in the diet wouldn't be appropriate, however, because a phosphate deficiency stimulates cells to increase the phosphate transporter, increasing the cellular uptake of phosphate, with an effect similar to the dietary excess of phosphate, i.e., promotion of lung cancer (Xu, et al., 2010). The optimum dietary amount of phosphate, and its balance with other minerals, hasn't been determined.While increased phosphate slows mitochondrial energy production, decreasing its intracellular concentration increases the respiratory rate and the efficiency of ATP formation. A \"deficiency\" of polyunsaturated fatty acids has this effect (Nogueira, et al., 2001), but so does the consumption of fructose (Green, et al., 1993; Lu, et al., 1994).In a 1938 experiment (Brown, et al.) that intended to show the essentiality of unsaturated fats, a man, William Brown, lived for six months on a 2500 calorie diet consisting of sucrose syrup, a gallon of milk (some of it in the form of cottage cheese), and the juice of half an orange, besides some vitamins and minerals. The experimenters remarked about the surprising disappearance of the normal fatigue after a day's work, as well as the normalization of his high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and the permanent disappearance of his frequent life-long migraine headaches. His respiratory quotient increased (producing more carbon dioxide), as well as his rate of resting metabolism. I think the most interesting part of the experiment was that his blood phosphate decreased. In two measurements during the experimental diet, his fasting plasma inorganic phosphorus was 3.43 and 2.64 mg. per 100 ml. of plasma, and six month after he had returned to a normal diet the number was 4.2 mg/100 ml. Both the deficiency of the \"essential\" unsaturated fatty acids, and the high sucrose intake probably contributed to lowering the phosphate.In 2000, researchers who were convinced that fructose is harmful to the health, reasoned that its harmful effects would be exacerbated by consuming it in combination with a diet deficient in magnesium. Eleven men consumed, for six months, test diets with high fructose corn syrup or starch, along with some fairly normal U.S. foods, and with either extremely low magnesium content, or with slightly deficient magnesium content. The authors' conclusion was clearly stated in the title of their article, that the combination adversely affects the mineral balance of the body.However, looking at their results in the context of these other studies of the effects of fructose on phosphate, I don't think their conclusion is correct. Even on the extremely low magnesium intake, both their magnesium and calcium balances were positive, meaning that on average their bodies accumulated a little magnesium and calcium, even though men aged 22 to 40 presumably weren't growing very much. To steadily accumulate both calcium and magnesium, with the calcium retention much larger than the magnesium, the minerals were probably mostly being incorporated into their bones. Their phosphate balance, however, was slightly negative on the \"high fructose\" diet. If the sugar was having the same effect that it had on William Brown in 1938 (and in animal experiments), some of the phosphate loss was accounted for by the reduced amount in blood and other body fluids, but to continue through the months of the experiment, some of it must have represented a change in the composition of the bones. When there is more carbon dioxide in the body fluids, calcium carbonate can be deposited in the bones (Messier, et al., 1979). Increased carbon dioxide could account for a prolonged negative phosphate balance, by taking its place in the bones in combination with calcium and magnesium.Another important effect of carbon dioxide is in the regulation of both calcium and phosphate, by increasing the absorption and retention of calcium (Canzanello, et al., 1995), and by increasing the excretion of phosphate. Increased carbon dioxide (as dissolved gas) and bicarbonate (as sodium bicarbonate) both increase the excretion of phosphate in the urine, even in the absence of the parathyroid hormone. Below the normal level of serum bicarbonate, reabsorption of phosphate by the kidneys is greatly increased (Jehle, et al., 1999). Acetazolamide increases the body's retention of carbon dioxide, and increases the amount of phosphate excreted in the urine.Much of the calcium dissolved in the blood is in the form of a complex of calcium and bicarbonate, with a single positive charge (Hughes, et al., 1984). Failure to consider this complexed form of calcium leads to errors in measuring the amount of calcium in the blood, and in interpreting its physiological effects, including its intracellular behavior. Hyperventilation can cause cramping of skeletal muscles, constriction of blood vessels, and excitation of platelets and other cells; the removal of carbon dioxide from the blood lowers the carbonic acid, changing the state and function of calcium. Hyperventilation increases phosphate and parathyroid hormone, and decreases calcium (Krapf, et al., 1992).Since estrogen tends to cause hyperventilation, lowering carbon dioxide, its role in phosphate metabolism should be investigated more thoroughly. Work by Han, et al. (2002) and Xu, et al. (2003) showed that estrogen increases phosphate reabsorption by the kidney, but estrogen also increases cortisol, which decreases reabsorption, so the role of estrogen in the whole system has to be be considered.This calcium solubilizing effect of bicarbonate, combined with its phosphaturic effect, probably accounts for the relaxing effect of carbon dioxide on the blood vessels and bronchial smooth muscles, and for the prevention of vascular calcification by the thyroid hormones (Sato, et al., 2005, Tatar, 2009, Kim, et al., 2012). Distensibility of the blood vessels and heart, increased by carbon dioxide, is decreased in hypothyroidism, heart failure, and by phosphate.While fructose lowers intracellular phosphate, it also lowers the amount that the intestine absorbs from food (Kirchner, et al.,2008), and the Milne-Nielsen study suggests that it increases phosphate loss through the kidneys. The \"anti-aging\" protein, klotho, increases the ability of the kidneys to excrete phosphate (Dërmaku-Sopjani, et al., 2011), and like fructose, it supports energy production and maintains thermogenesis (Mori, et al., 2000).Lowering the amount of phosphate in the blood allows the parathyroid hormone to decrease. While the parathyroid hormone also prevents phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys, it causes mast cells to release serotonin (and serotonin increases the kidneys' reabsorption of phosphate), and possibly has other pro-inflammatory effects.  For example, deleting the PTH gene compensates for the harmful (accelerated calcification and osteoporosis) effects of deleting the klotho gene, apparently by preventing the increase of osteopontin (Yuan, et al., 2012).Niacinamide is another nutrient that lowers serum phosphate (Cheng, et al., 2008), by inhibiting intestinal absorption (Katai, et al., 1989), and also by reducing its reabsorption by the kidneys (Campbell, et al., 1989). Niacinamide's reduction of free fatty acids by inhibiting lipolysis, protecting the use of glucose for energy, might be involved in its effect on phosphate (by analogy with the phosphate lowering action of a deficiency of polyunsaturated fatty acids). Aspirin is another antilipolytic substance (de Zentella, et al., 2002) which stimulates energy production from sugar and lowers phosphate, possibly combined with improved magnesium retention (Yamada and Morohashi, 1986).A diet that provides enough calcium to limit activity of the parathyroid glands, and that is low in phosphate and polyunsaturated fats, with sugar rather than starch as the main carbohydrate, possibly supplemented by niacinamide and aspirin, should help to avoid some of the degenerative processes associated with high phosphate: fatigue, heart failure, movement discoordination, hypogonadism, infertility, vascular calcification, emphysema, cancer, osteoporosis, and atrophy of skin, skeletal muscle, intestine, thymus, and spleen (Ohnishi and Razzaque, 2010; Shiraki-Iida, et al., 2000; Kuro-o, et al., 1997; Osuka and Razzaque, 2012). The foods naturally highest in phosphate, relative to calcium, are cereals, legumes, meats, and fish. Many prepared foods contain added phosphate. Foods with a higher, safer ratio of calcium to phosphate are leaves, such as kale, turnip greens, and beet greens, and many fruits, milk, and cheese. Coffee, besides being a good source of magnesium, is probably helpful for lowering phosphate, by its antagonism to adenosine (Coulson, et al., 1991).Although increased phosphate generally causes vascular calcification (increasing rigidity, with increased systolic blood pressure), when a high level of dietary phosphate comes from milk and cheese, it is epidemiologically associated with reduced blood pressure (Takeda, et al., 2012).Phosphate toxicity offers some interesting insights into stress and aging, helping to explain the protective effects of carbon dioxide, thyroid hormone, sugar, niacinamide, and calcium. It also suggests that other natural substances used as food additives should be investigated more thoroughly. Excessive citric acid, for example, might activate dormant cancer cells (Havard, et al., 2011), and has been associated with malignancy (Blüml, et al., 2011). Nutritional research has hardly begun to investigate the optimal ratios of minerals, fats, amino acids, and other things in foods, and how they interact with the natural toxicants, antinutrients, and hormone disrupters in many organisms used for food.REFERENCESJ Physiology 1962; 161, 379-391.

        "chunk_html": "Rosacea, inflammation, and aging:The inefficiency of stressRosacea, or acne rosacea, has been defined as \"vascular and follicular dilation involving the nose and contiguous portions of the cheeks . . .\" that may involve persistent erythema with hyperplasia of sebaceous glands.Stedman's Medical Dictionary 23rd edition.Light-skinned people, especially women between the ages of 30 and 50, sometimes develop a persistent redness of their cheeks and nose. It may begin as a tendency to flush excessively, but the blood vessels can become chronically dilated. Similar processes occur in dark-skinned people less frequently.The eyes are sometimes involved, with redness of the exposed areas (conjuctival hyperemia). New blood vessels develop in the area, and the flow of blood through the affected tissue is greatly increased. The tissues become thickened and fibrotic, with the multiplication of fibroblasts and the increased deposition of collagen.The cornea normally receives its oxygen from the air, and its nutrients from the aqueous humor. As rosacea of the eye develops, the blood vessels surrounding the cornea become increasingly visible, and, especially on the inner (nasal) side of the eye, the vessels tend to enlarge and become tortuous. Rhinophyma, or potato nose, has been described as a late development of rosacea.Too often, the medical reaction is to give the condition a name, and to distinguish its variants as if they were different problems, and then to use the most direct means to eliminate the problem they have defined.A typical attitude is that \"Rosacea is an enigmatic disease with multiple exacerbations and remissions, and, unfortunately, treatment is directed toward symptomatic control rather than cure\" (Randleman).Lasers or other radiation, caustic chemical abrasion, surgical planing and dermal shaves, and other forms of surgery may be used to destroy the superficial blood vessels, and to reduce the enlarged nose or other irregularities. A few decades ago, when rosacea was believed to be the result of a local infection, antibiotics were used to treat it, and some of them, including tetracycline, helped. It was discovered that some antibiotics have anti-inflammatory actions, apart from their germicidal effects, and now it is very common to prescribe the chronic use of tetracycline to suppress symptoms.Rosacea, and the fibrotic changes associated with it (pingueculae and pterygia in the eyes, rhinophyma of the nose, etc.), are much more than \"cosmetic\" issues, involving the skin and eye surface. If the invasive proliferation of blood vessels can be prevented, it's important to do that, because, for example, pannus/neovascularization of the cornea can seriously impair vision.But possibly the strangest thing about the relationship of the medical profession to rosacea is that its essential features, invasive neovascularization and fibrotic growth, are of great interest when they occur elsewhere, and many physiological processes are known to regulate the growth of blood vessels and fibroblasts, but nearly all the attention given to rosacea and rhinophyma concerns control of symptoms for cosmetic effect. Rosacea is a physiological problem that deserves consideration in the light of all that's known about physiology and developmental biology.The increased incidence of rosacea after the age of 30, and the fact that it occurs most commonly in the areas that are most exposed to sunlight (bald men sometimes develop it on the top of the head), indicate that aging and irritation are essential causes. Stress, irritation (such as produced by ultraviolet or ionizing radiation or free radicals), and aging are known to cause disorganized growth of fibrous and vascular tissues in various parts of the body. The occurrence of these processes at the surface, where the changes can be observed immediately, and without invasive procedures, should have aroused wide interest among those who study kidney disease, diabetes, and other degenerative diseases in which fibrosis and neovascularization play important roles.A localized stress or irritation at first produces vasodilation that increases the delivery of blood to the tissues, allowing them to compensate for the stress by producing more energy. Some of the agents that produce vasodilation also reduce oxygen consumption (nitric oxide, for example), helping to restore a normal oxygen tension to the tissue. Hypoxia itself (produced by factors other than irritation) can induce vasodilation, and if prolonged sufficiently, tends to produce neovascularization and fibrosis.Sensitivity to the harmful effects of light can be increased by some drugs and by excess porphyrins produced in the body (and by the porphyrin precursor, delta-amino levulinic acid), leading to rosacea, so those factors should be considered, but too often alcohol (which can cause porphyrin to increase) is blamed for rosacea and rhinophyma, without justification. There are many ways in which poor health can increase light sensitivity. Some types of excitation produced by metabolites (or by the failure of inhibitory metabolites) can produce vasodilation, involving the release of nitric oxide (Cardenas, et al., 2000), setting off a series of potentially pathological reactions, including fibrosis. The nitric oxide increases glycolysis while lowering energy production. The excitatory metabolite glutamate, and nitric oxide, are both inhibited by aspirin (Moro, et al., 2000).When blood flow in skin affected by rosacea was measured, circulation was 3 or 4 times higher than normal (Sibenge & Gawkrodger, 1992), and oxygen tension may be increased. An inability to extract oxygen from the blood, or to use it to produce energy, will produce the same hyperemia that would be produced by a lack of oxygen. These measurements suggest that mitochondrial defects would be the best place to look for a general cause of rosacea.When mitochondria are damaged, active cells produce increased amounts of lactic acid, even in the presence of adequate oxygen. Otto Warburg identified this kind of metabolism, aerobic glycolysis, as an essential feature of cancer, and showed that it could be produced by stress, ionizing radiation, carcinogenic toxins, and even by a simple oxygen deficiency. Other investigators around the same time showed that lactic acid produces vasodilation (for example, in the cornea), and more recently it has been shown to promote the development of fibrosis, and it has been called a \"phlogogen,\" a promoter of inflammation.Riboflavin, vitamin B2, is an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory enzymes, and it is very easily destroyed by light (blue light and especially ultraviolet). When it is excited by high energy light, it can spread the damage to other components of the mitochondria, including the cytochromes and the polyunsaturated fatty acids. The other B vitamins are affected when riboflavin's actions are disturbed.Vitamin K is also extremely light sensitive, and it interacts closely with coenzyme Q in regulating mitochondrial metabolism. For example, mitochondrial Complex-I, NADH-ubiquinone reductase, is probably the most easily damaged part of the mitochondrion, and it is protected by vitamin K. Vitamin E, coenzyme Q, and the polyunsaturated fatty acids are also light sensitive, and they are more susceptible to free radical damage when vitamin K is deficient.Niacinamide, one of the B vitamins, provides energy to this mitochondrial system. Under stress and strong excitation, cells waste niacinamide-NADH, but niacinamide itself has a sedative antiexcitatory effect, and some of its actions resemble a hormone. Estrogen tends to interfere with the formation of niacin from tryptophan. Tryptophan, rather than forming the sedative niacin (pyridine carboxylic acid), can be directed toward formation of the excitatory quinolinic acid (pyridine dicarboxylic acid) by polyunsaturated fatty acids. Excitation must be in balance with a cell's energetic resources, and niacinamide can play multiple protective roles, decreasing excitation, increasing energy production, and stabilizing repair systems. The state of excitation and type of energy metabolism are crucial factors in governing cell functions and survival.The polyunsaturated fatty acids, besides their interactions with estrogen and tryptophan metabolism, promote excitation and decrease energy production in several other ways. For example, they increase the excitatory effects of the glutamate pathways (Yu, et al., 1986; Nishikawa, 1994), and their breakdown products inhibit mitochondrial respiration (Humphries, et al., 1998; Picklo, et al., 1999; Lovell, et al., 2000).The excess excitation that produces nitric oxide and lactic acid lowers the energy production of vascular cells, possibly enough to lower their contractile ability (Geng, et al., 1992), causing vasodilation. When flushing is caused by a mismatch between energy supply and energy demand, caffeine can decrease the vasodilation (Eikvar & Kirkebøen, 1998), but when vasodilation is caused more physiologically by carbon dioxide, caffeine doesn't have that effect (Meno, et al., 2005). In a study in which drinking hot water or coffee was compared with drinking room-temperature coffee or caffeine, it was found that the hot liquids caused flushing, but cool coffee and caffeine didn't.Caffeine increases cells' energy efficiency, and by opposing the effects of adenosine (secreted by cells that are stressed and energy-depleted), it can inhibit vasodilation, angioneogenesis (Merighi, et al., 2007; Ryzhov, et al., 2007), and fibrosis (Chan, et al., 2006).One nearly ubiquitous source of inappropriate excitation and energy depletion is the endotoxin, bacterial lipopolysaccharides absorbed from the intestine (Wang and White, 1999). That this ubiquitous toxin has a role in rosacea is suggested by the observation that intestinal stimulation, to speed transit through the bowel, immediately relieved symptoms (Kendall, 2002). Increased cortisol (Simon, et al., 1998) and sepsis (Levy, 2007) interfere with mitochondrial energy production.Simple nervous blushing or flushing is usually considered harmless, and when a person is overheated, the reddening of the skin has the function of facilitating heat loss, to restore a normal temperature. But even nerve-regulated flushing can involve a distinct interference with mitochondrial respiration, and can stimulate the overgrowth of blood vessels.Cancer's respiratory defect that Warburg identified, fermentation with lactic acid production even in the presence of adequate oxygen, was the result of some kind of injury to the mitochondria. He showed that one of the injuries that could produce aerobic glycolysis was a deficiency of riboflavin. He observed that tumors generally were anoxic, and that cancers typically appeared in the midst of tissue that was atrophying, and suggested that the cancer cells' survival was favored by their ability to live without oxygen. This may be relevant to the observations of many surgeons of a small cancer embedded in the fibrous tissue of large rhinophymas that have been removed.The relatively high incidence of rosacea among women (some studies indicate that it may be 3 times as common in women as in men) isn't likely to be the result of greater sun exposure, so it's reasonable to look for hormonal causes.In old age, it's well recognized that men's estrogen level rises. But the estrogen industry has convinced women that their estrogen declines as they get older. It's common knowledge that aging rodents often go into \"persistent estrus,\" and that their estrogen levels generally increase with age (Parkening, et al., 1978; Anisimov and Okulov, 1981). Several studies in women have shown that serum estrogen levels rise from the teens into the 40s (Musey, et al., 1987; Wilshire, et al., 1995; Santoro, et al., 1996).Other studies show that serum and tissue estrogen concentrations are not concordant, and that some tissues may contain several times as much estrogen as the serum (Jefcoate, et al., 2001). Local irritation increases tissue estrogen content.The antiestrogens, especially progesterone, begin declining in the 30s, so that the rising estrogen has more effect on the tissues during those years. These are the years in which the incidence of rosacea rises suddenly. Rosacea develops later on average in men, whose estrogen levels rise significantly at later ages.Estrogen's most immediate effect on cells is to alter their oxidative metabolism. It promotes the formation of lactic acid. In the long run, it increases the nutritional requirements for the B vitamins, as well as for other vitamins. It also increases the formation of aminolevulinic acid, a precursor of porphyrin, and increases the risk of excess porphyrin increasing light sensitivity. Both aminolevulinic acid and excess porphyrins are toxic to mitochondria, apart from their photosensitizing actions. Nitric oxide, glutamate, and cortisol all tend to be increased by estrogen.Veins and capillaries are highly sensitive to estrogen, and women are more likely than men to have varicose veins, spider veins, leaky capillaries, and other vascular problems besides rosacea.  Estrogen can promote angioneogenesis by a variety of mechanisms, including nitric oxide (Johnson, et al., 2006). \"Estrogens potentiate corticosteroid effects on the skin such as striae, telangiectasiae, and rosacea dermatitis\" (Zaun, 1981). Early forms of oral contraceptives, high in estrogen, were found to increase acne rosacea more than three-fold (Prenen & Ledoux-Corbusier, 1971).Lactic acid, produced under the influence of estrogen, nitric oxide, or other problems of energy formation, besides causing vasodilation, also stimulates the growth of fibroblasts. Oxygen deprivation, or damage to mitochondria, will increase lactic acid formation, and so it will immediately cause vasodilation, and if the problem is prolonged, new blood vessels will grow, and fibrous connective tissue will increase. Estrogen stimulates collagen synthesis, and it has been associated with a variety of inflammatory and fibrotic conditions (for example, Cutolo, et al., 2003. Payne, et al., 2006, suggest the use of the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen, to treat rhinophyma.)The cornea normally contains more riboflavin even than the retina, which has a much higher rate of metabolism. When the cornea isn't able to get enough oxygen from the air for its needs (and if riboflavin is deficient, its need for oxygen is increased), surrounding blood vessels at first dilate in response to the diffusing lactic acid, to increase the blood supply to the edges of the cornea. If the problem is prolonged, the conjuctiva becomes chronically blood-shot, hyperemic, and larger more visible blood vessels grow, surrounding the cornea, or even invading the cornea. Many people, especially women, experienced problems of this sort from wearing contact lenses, especially when the lenses were made of materials very impermeable to oxygen (Dumbleton, et al., 2006).Sunlight, and mechanical obstruction of the cornea, produce very localized effects, but those local effects are more likely to be harmful when there is a systemic nutritional deficiency or excess of estrogen. When the systemic problem is very severe, the cheeks, nose, and eyes might not be the first tissues to experience a functional disturbance.The mitochondrial inhibition produced by the action of the parasympathetic nervous system (occurring in simple blushing) can occur wherever those nerves act, and blood vessels in all parts of the body are responsive to the acetylcholine secreted by those nerves. Sleep typically involves a shift of dominance in the autonomic nervous system toward the parasympathetic nerves, with vasodilation. Nosebleeds, especially in children, commonly occur during sleep (Jarjour & Jarjour, 2005: high incidence in sleep, and association with migraine).A 3 year-old child who had been having an average of 3 nosebleeds every day, during a nap and at night, for several months, also had an extreme behavior problem. He became angry and sometimes violent when he went a little longer than normal between meals. After an oral dose of about ten milligrams of riboflavin, he was able to sleep without having another recurrence of the nosebleeds, and his tantrums became rare. Apparently, the nerve-regulated vasodilation produced by sleep, combined with a riboflavin deficiency, had been enough to produce nosebleeds. The energy deficit resulting from a systemic riboflavin deficiency had probably been causing him to be abnormally sensitive to glycogen depletion, producing sudden anger. In another individual, the energy problem might have taken the form of a memory problem, or of a hemorrhage in the brain or other essential organ.A 37 year old slightly alcoholic man with a bright red nose and cheeks was an amateur fiction writer, but he was having trouble with his memory for words, and for everyday events. Even conversationally, he had to struggle for relatively familiar words. On the suggestion that riboflavin might help his memory, by allowing his brain cells to use oxygen more efficiently, he had his doctor give him an intravenous injection of B vitamins. When I saw him the next day, his conversation was perfectly fluent, and he obviously had easy access to a good vocabulary. Just as noticeable was the normal color of his nose and cheeks. For a week, he had a daily injection of the B vitamins, and his nose color and vocabulary stayed normal. But on the weekend, after not having the shots for two days, his nose and cheeks were again maraschino cherry red, and his speech was halting, as he struggled for words. He forgot the whole episode, and neglected to return to the doctor for more of the vitamin injections. Ten years later, he had developed a medium-sized potato nose, and had his heart valves replaced.His vitamin requirements were apparently abnormally high. At first, the problems resulting from damaged mitochondria seem mostly functional (flushing, mood, memory problems, etc.) and variable, but chronically disturbed functions lead to structural, anatomical changes, as prolonged stimulation alters tissue maintenance and growth.Abram Hoffer, who had been treating schizophrenia and senile dementia with niacin, accidentally discovered that it cured his bleeding gums. That led to its use to treat heart disease.The \"orthomolecular\" ideas of Hoffer and Linus Pauling were developed in a context of biochemistry governed by genetics, molecular biology, in which the goal was to provide a chemical that was lacking because of a genetic defect in metabolism. Their idea of using nutrients as drugs has led to many unphysiological practices, in which an isolated nutrient is supposed to have a drug-like action, and if in isolation it doesn't act like a drug, then it should be used only according to the normal genetically determined nutritional requirement.But in reality, nutritional requirements are strongly influenced by history and present circumstances. For example, when corneal mitochondria have been damaged by riboflavin deficiency, they have been found to subsequently require more than the normal amount of the vitamin to function properly. And the presence of a certain amount of one nutrient often increases or decreases the amount of other nutrients needed.When the interactions among energy expenditure and energy production, and cellular activation and cellular inhibition, are taken into account, then it's clear that any particular problem is likely to have many causes and many factors that could contribute to a cure.Lactate, glutamate, ammonium, nitric oxide, quinolinate, estrogen, histamine, aminolevulinate, porphyrin, ultraviolet light, polyunsaturated fatty acids and endotoxin contribute to excitatory and excitotoxic processes, vasodilation, angioneogenesis, and fibrosis.Carbon dioxide, glycine, GABA, saturated fatty acids (for example, Nanji, et al., 1997), vitamin K, coenzyme Q10, niacinamide, magnesium, red light, thyroid hormone, progesterone, testosterone, and pregnenolone are factors that can be increased to protect against inappropriate cellular excitation.All of the nutritional factors that participate in mitochondrial respiration contribute to maintaining a balance between excessive excitation and protective inhibition. Riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin K, niacinamide, thiamine, and selenium are the nutrients that most directly relate to mitochondrial energy production.Coffee is often avoided by people with rosacea, but it is a very good source of niacin and magnesium, and caffeine has some of the same cell-protective functions as niacinamide.People suffering from rosacea have been found to be more likely than average to have suffered from styes in childhood, to have varicose veins and spider veins, and to suffer from migraines and depression.Hypothyroidism has been identified as a factor in all of those. Good thyroid function is necessary for resistance to bacterial infection, for regulation of blood sugar, neurotransmitters, and hormones related to mood, and for the formation of progesterone. Progesterone regulates smooth muscle tone, including the walls of veins, so that a deficiency allows veins to enlarge. It also prevents overgrowth of fibrotic tissue, and in some contexts may inhibit angioneogenesis.GABA itself tends to raise body temperature (Ishiwata, et al., 2005), by controlling vasodilation, and the factors such as progesterone which protect mitochondrial energy production are also thermogenic, supporting the GABA system. Flushing, both by directly causing heat loss and by reducing mitochondrial energy production, tends to lower body temperature.The sun-damaged areas in rosacea can be directly provided with some of the protective factors by applying them topically. In the same way that topical lactate can cause vasodilation and disturbed energy metabolism (Rendl, et al., 2001), topical niacinamide, progesterone, vitamin K, and coenzyme Q10 can improve the metabolism and function of the local tissues. Riboflavin can probably be useful when applied topically, but because of its extreme sensitivity to light, it should usually be used only internally, unless the treated skin is covered to prevent exposure to light. Topically applied caffeine, even after sun exposure, can reduce local tissue damage (Koo, et al., 2007). Aspirin and saturated fats can also be protective when applied topically.Some of the benefit from antibiotics probably results from the reduced endotoxin stress when intestinal bacteria are suppressed. However, antibiotics can kill the intestinal bacteria that produce vitamin K, so it's important to include that in the diet when antibiotics are used.Some fibers, such as raw carrots, that are effective for lowering endotoxin absorption also contain natural antibiotics, so regular use of carrots should be balanced by occasional supplementation with vitamin K, or by occasionally eating liver or broccoli.Abram Hoffer's research was instrumental in getting niacin recognized as a heart protective drug, but nearly everyone who prescribes it does so to lower blood lipids. That wasn't Hoffer's understanding of its function. He thought it acted directly on blood vessels to protect their integrity. During his studies of its effects on heart disease, he saw that it also lowered cancer mortality, and so began treating cancer patients with it, with considerable success, but there was no medical cliché that could allow the profession to follow in that direction.The arguments I have outlined for considering rosacea to be essentially a problem of metabolic energy, and the mechanisms that I mention for restoring mitochondrial functions, might seem more complex than Hoffer's orthomolecular views. However, this approach is actually much simpler conceptually than any of the ideologies of drug treatment. It simply points out that certain excitatory factors can interfere with energy production, and that there are opposing \"inhibitory\" factors that can restore energy efficiency. Sometimes, using just one or two of the factors can be curative.Because mitochondrial respiration is very similar in every kind of tissue, a physiological view of rosacea could incline us toward considering the effects of these metabolic factors in other organs during stress and aging--what would the analogous condition of rosacea and rhinophyma be in the brain, heart, liver, or kidney?REFERENCESProbl Endokrinol (Mosk), 1981 Mar-Apr, 27:2, 48-52.[Blood estradiol level and G2-chalone content in the vaginal mucosa in rats of different ages]Anisimov VN; Okulov VB \"17 beta-Estradiol level was higher in the blood serum of rats aged 14 to 16 months with regular estral cycles during all the phases as compared to that in 3- to 4-month-old female rats.\"Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1991 Jun;32(7):1981-5.Analysis of flavins in ocular tissues of the rabbit. Batey DW, Eckhert CD. Riboflavin is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), coenzymes required for the activity of flavoenzymes involved in the transfer of electrons in oxidation-reduction reactions. Flavins are light sensitive and rapidly degrade when exposed to light in the near ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. Some of the byproducts of flavin photodegradation are toxic. A quantitative survey of flavins in rabbit ocular tissues is reported. Adult male Dutch-Belt Rabbits were fed purified diets containing 3, 30, or 300 mg riboflavin/kg for 1 month. A method of aqueous extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection was used to measure riboflavin, FMN, and FAD in cornea, lens cortex, lens nucleus, retina, and blood. The retina contained the highest flavin concentration. In all tissues, the primary flavin was FAD followed by FMN and riboflavin. The highest concentration of riboflavin occurred in the cornea followed by the retina, lens cortex, and lens nucleus. A trend toward increasing concentrations of riboflavin occurred in the retina and blood in response to excess dietary riboflavin, but the concentration changes were not statistically significant. The highest concentration of FAD and FMN occurred in the retina followed by the cornea and the lens cortex and nucleus. The relative contribution of riboflavin, FMN, and FAD to the total flavin pool was markedly different in the various tissues of the eye. The proportion of tissue flavins present as riboflavin decreased from anterior to posterior. It was highest in the cornea followed by lens and retina. The pattern of distribution for FMN was: cornea greater than retina greater than lens cortex and nucleus.Boll Ocul. 1955 Mar;34(3):157-70.[Clinical contribution on riboflavin deficiency of the eye.][Article in Italian] Bellomio S.Eur J Pharmacol. 2006 Oct 10;547(1-3):184-91.Characterization of the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of riboflavin in different experimental models.Bertollo CM, Oliveira AC, Rocha LT, Costa KA, Nascimento EB Jr, Coelho MM.Vestn Oftalmol. 1961 Nov-Dec;74:48-53.[The content of riboflavin and ascorbic acid in the cornea in burns of the eye.][Article in Russian] Blinova LI, Tsypin LM, Sheinberg AI.J Neurochem. 2000 May;74(5):2041-8.Implication of glutamate in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase after oxygen and glucose deprivation in rat forebrain slices.Cardenas A, Moro MA, Hurtado O, Leza JC, Lorenzo P, Castrillo A, Bodelon OG, Bosca L, Lizasoain I.Br J Pharmacol. 2006 Aug;148(8):1144-55.Adenosine A(2A) receptors play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic cirrhosis.Chan ES, Montesinos MC, Fernandez P, Desai A, Delano DL, Yee H, Reiss AB, Pillinger MH, Chen JF, Schwarzschild MA, Friedman SL, Cronstein BN.Clin Exp Rheumatol.  2003 Nov-Dec;21(6):687-90.New roles for estrogens in rheumatoid arthritis.Cutolo M, Capellino S, Montagna P, Villaggio B, Sulli A, Seriolo B, Straub RH. Sex hormones appear to play an important role as modulators of autoimmune disease onset/perpetuation. Steroid hormones are implicated in the immune response, with estrogens as enhancers at least of humoral immunity, and androgens and progesterone (and glucocorticoids) as natural immune suppressors. Serum levels of estrogens have been found to be normal in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Synovial fluid levels (SF) of proinflammatory estrogens relative to androgens are significantly elevated in both male and female RA patients as compared to controls, which is most probably due to an increase in local aromatase activity. Thus, available steroid pre-hormones are rapidly converted to proinflammatory estrogens in the synovial tissue in the presence of inflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF alpha, IL-1, IL-6). The increased estrogen concentrations observed in RA SF of both sexes are characterized mainly by the hydroxylated forms, in particular 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone, showing a mitogenic stimulating role. Indeed, recent studies by us indicate that 17-beta estradiol (E2) clearly enhanced the expression of markers of cell growth and proliferation, whereas testosterone (T) induced an increase in markers indicating DNA damage and apoptosis. In particular, our data further shows that the enhancing role of estrogens on the immune/inflammatory response is exerted by activating the NFkB complex. In conclusion, locally increased estrogens may exert activating effects on synovial cell proliferation, including macrophages and fibroblasts, suggesting new roles for estrogens in RA.Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 1998 Mar 30;118(9):1390-5.[Receptor mediated effects of adenosine and caffeine][Article in Norwegian] Eikvar L, Kirkebøen KA. \"Adenosine consists of one ribose and one purine moiety and binds to specific receptors on cell membranes. The receptors are coupled to G-proteins and additionally to various effector-systems. When a mismatch occurs between energy supply and energy demand, adenosine is produced by the catabolism of adenosine triphosphate. The metabolism of an organ is thereby coupled to the local blood supply (metabolic vasodilation).\"Arch Dermatol. 1988 Jan;124(1):72-9.Health effects of sunlight exposure in the United States. Results from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1971-1974.Engel A, Johnson ML, Haynes SG. The dermatologic component of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 20,637), conducted from 1971 through 1974, documented the deleterious effect of ultraviolet radiation on selected skin and eye conditions. Actinic skin damage was more frequent in white men with high as compared with low sunlight exposure, 36.7% vs 23.3%, respectively. Among white women, the corresponding figures were 34.1% vs 18.6%, respectively. Actinic damage was found more often in individuals with light eye color. Basal cell epitheliomas were found in 11.3% of white men aged 65 to 74 years who had severely actinic-damaged skin as compared with 1.0% of those with undamaged skin. Sunlight exposure was positively associated with localized hypomelanism, localized hypermelanism, seborrheic keratoses, senile lentigines, freckles, acne rosacea, spider nevi, varicose veins, venus star, dry skin, wrinkled skin, pterygia, arcus senilis, and a variety of minor oral lesions of the tongue, palate, and buccal mucosa. These findings suggest that a large number of dermatologic conditions, which may in part result from overexposure to sunlight, may be preventable.Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 1961 Dec 10;65:2439-44.[The effects of vitamin B2 group on the corneal metabolism.

We have studied NO production and its effects on energy metabolism in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. It was observed that the cytokines, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, synergistically induced an arginine-dependent production of NO in these cells. This was associated with an inhibition of complex I (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and complex II (succinate: ubiquinone oxidoreductase) activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, suggesting that NO blocks mitochondrial respiration in these cells. Lactate accumulated in the media of the cells, implying an increased anaerobic glycolysis, but there was no reduction of viability. An NO-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and a switch to anaerobic glycolysis would reduce energy production of the SMCs. This would in turn reduce the contractile capacity of the cell and might represent another NO-dependent vasodilatory mechanism.\"Q Bull Northwest Univ Med Sch. 1952;26(2):120-3.Riboflavin and the cornea.Gordon OE.Bull Soc Fr Dermatol Syphiligr. 1950 May-Jun;57(3):277-80.Cutaneous-mucosal ariboflavinosis; rosacea of cornea and medio-facial seborrheic dermatitis.Gougerot H, Grupper C, Plas G.Br J Dermatol. 2005 Dec;153(6):1176-81.Comorbidity of rosacea and depression: an analysis of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey--Outpatient Department data collected by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics from 1995 to 2002.Gupta MA, Gupta AK, Chen SJ, Johnson AM.Biochemistry. 1998 Nov 10;37(45):15835-41.Selective inactivation of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase: reaction of lipoic acid with 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal.Humphries KM, Szweda LI. \"Previous research has established that 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a highly toxic product of lipid peroxidation, is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration. HNE exerts its effects on respiration by inhibiting alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH). Because of the central role of KGDH in metabolism and emerging evidence that free radicals contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction associated with numerous diseases, it is of great interest to further characterize the mechanism of inhibition.\" \"These results therefore identify a potential mechanism whereby free radical production and subsequent lipid peroxidation lead to specific modification of KGDH and PDH and inhibition of NADH-linked mitochondrial respiration.\"Biochemistry. 1998 Jan 13;37(2):552-7.Inhibition of NADH-linked mitochondrial respiration by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal.Humphries KM, Yoo Y, Szweda LI. During the progression of certain degenerative conditions, including myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, mitochondria are a source of increased free-radical generation and exhibit declines in respiratory function(s). It has therefore been suggested that oxidative damage to mitochondrial components plays a critical role in the pathology of these processes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of membrane lipids are prime molecular targets of free-radical damage. A major product of lipid peroxidation, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), is highly cytotoxic and can readily react with and damage protein. In this study, the effects of HNE on intact cardiac mitochondria were investigated to gain insight into potential mechanisms by which free radicals mediate mitochondrial dysfunction. Exposure of mitochondria to micromolar concentrations of HNE caused rapid declines in NADH-linked but not succinate-linked state 3 and uncoupled respiration. The activity of complex I was unaffected by HNE under the conditions of our experiments. Loss of respiratory activity reflected the inability of HNE-treated  mitochondria to meet NADH demand during maximum rates of O2 consumption. HNE exerted its effects on intact mitochondria by inactivating alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. These results therefore identify a potentially important mechanism by which free radicals bring about declines in mitochondrial respiration.Tohoku J Exp Med. 1954 Dec 25;61(1):93-104.Contribution to the ocular manifestation of riboflavin deficiency.Irinoda K, Sato S.Brain Res. 2005 Jun 28;1048(1-2):32-40.Changes of body temperature and thermoregulatory responses of freely moving rats during GABAergic pharmacological stimulation to the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus in several ambient temperatures.Ishiwata T, Saito T, Hasegawa H, Yazawa T, Kotani Y, Otokawa M, Aihara Y.Pediatr Neurol. 2005 Aug;33(2):94-7.Migraine and recurrent epistaxis in children.Jarjour IT, Jarjour LK.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr 2000;(27):95-112.Tissue-specific synthesis and oxidative metabolism of estrogens.Jefcoate CR, Liehr JG, Santen RJ, Sutter TR, Yager JD, Yue W, Santner SJ, Tekmal R, Demers L, Pauley R, Naftolin F, Mor G, Berstein L \"However, breast cancer tissue E2 levels are 10-fold to 50-fold higher in postmenopausal women than predicted from plasma levels.\"Endocrine. 2006 Dec;30(3):333-42.Effects of estradiol-17beta on expression of mRNA for seven angiogenic factors and their receptors in the endometrium of ovariectomized (OVX) ewes.Johnson ML, Grazul-Bilska AT, Redmer DA, Reynolds LP.Clin Exp Dermatol. 2004 May;29(3):297-9.Remission of rosacea induced by reduction of gut transit time.Kendall SN. Rosacea is a chronic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity of the facial vasculature, presenting with intense flushing eventually leading to chronic erythema and telangiectasia. Although the precise aetiology of rosacea is not known, numerous associations with inflammatory gastrointestinal tract disorders have been reported. Furthermore, substance P-immunoreactive neurones occur in considerably greater numbers in tissue surrounding affected blood vessels suggesting involvement of neurogenic inflammation and moreover plasma kallikrein-kinin activation is consistently found in patients. In this report, a patient without digestive tract disease is described, who experienced complete remission of rosacea symptoms following ingestion of a material intended to sweep through the digestive tract and reduce transit time below 30 h. It is possible that intestinal bacteria are capable of plasma kallikrein-kinin activation and that flushing symptoms and the development of other characteristic features of rosacea result from frequent episodes of neurogenic inflammation caused by bradykinin-induced hypersensitization of facial afferent neurones. The possible relevance of this hypothesis to other conditions featuring afferent hypersensitivity, such as fibromyalgia, is considered.Br J Dermatol. 2007 May;156(5):957-64.Protection from photodamage by topical application of caffeine after ultraviolet  irradiation.Koo SW, Hirakawa S, Fujii S, Kawasumi M, Nghiem P.Medicina (B Aires) 1985;45(2):110-6.[Fibrosis and cirrhosis in the rabbit induced by diethylstilbestrol and its inhibition with progesterone].[Article in Spanish] Lanari A, de Kremer GH.Free Radic Biol Med. 2000 Oct 15;29(8):714-20.Acrolein, a product of lipid peroxidation, inhibits glucose and glutamate uptake in primary neuronal cultures.Lovell MA, Xie C, Markesbery WR.J Cereb Blood Flow Metab. 2005 Jun;25(6):775-84.Effect of caffeine on cerebral blood flow response to somatosensory stimulation.Meno JR, Nguyen TS, Jensen EM, Alexander West G, Groysman L, Kung DK, Ngai AC, Britz GW, Winn HR. \"Hypercarbic vasodilatation was unaffected by either caffeine or theophylline.\"Mol Pharmacol. 2007 Aug;72(2):395-406.Caffeine inhibits adenosine-induced accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-8 expression in hypoxic human colon cancer cells.Merighi S, Benini A, Mirandola P, Gessi S, Varani K, Simioni C, Leung E, Maclennan S, Baraldi PG, Borea PA.Neuropharmacology. 2000 Apr 27;39(7):1309-18.Mechanisms of the neuroprotective effect of aspirin after oxygen and glucose deprivation in rat forebrain slices.Moro MA, De Alba J, Cardenas A, De Cristobal J, Leza JC, Lizasoain I, Diaz-Guerra MJ, Bosca L, Lorenzo P.Am J Obstet Gynecol 1987 Aug;157(2):312-317.Age-related changes in the female hormonal environment during reproductive life.Musey VC, Collins DC, Musey PI, Martino-Saltzman D, Preedy JR \"We found that increased age during reproductive life is accompanied by a significant rise in both basal and stimulated serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels.

        "chunk_html": "Hot flashes, energy, and agingAround the time that menstruation and fertility are ending, certain biological problems are more likely to occur. Between the ages of 50 and 55, about 60% of women experience repeated episodes of flushing and sweating. Asthma, migraine, epilepsy, arthritis, varicose veins, aneurysms, urticaria, reduced lung function, hypertension, strokes, and interstitial colitis are some of the other problems that often begin or get worse at the menopause, but that normally aren't considered to be causally related to it.Recently, hot flashes are being taken more seriously, because of their association with increased inflammation, heart disease, and risk of dementia. Around the same age, late 40s to mid-50s, men begin to have a sudden increase of some of the same health problems, including night sweats, anxiety, and insomnia. In both sexes, the high incidence of depression in this age group has usually been explained \"psychologically,\" rather than biologically.When the estrogen industry began concentrating on women of menopausal age (after the disastrous years of selling it as a fertility drug), \"estrogen replacement\" therapy was promoted as a cure for the problems associated with menopause, including hot flashes, which were explained as the result of a deficiency of estrogen. However, in recent years, the phrase \"estrogen deficiency\" has begun to be replaced by the phrase \"estrogen withdrawal,\" because it has been found that women with hot flashes don't necessarily have less estrogen in their blood stream than women who don't have hot flashes.Associated with this change of terminology, there has been a recognition that changes in the temperature regulating system in the brain, rather than changes in the amount of estrogen, are responsible for the hot flashes, but mainstream medicine has carefully avoided the investigation of this subject. The effects of estrogen on the thermoregulatory system are very clear, but the standard medical view is that the physiology of hot flashes simply isn't understood.Since the medical literature boldly describes the mechanisms of the circulatory system and the causes of major problems such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, and strokes, it's odd that it doesn't have an explanation for \"hot flashes.\"But looking at this historically, I think this selective ignorance is necessary, for the protection of some doctrines that have become very important for conventional medicine.When doctors are talking about diseases of the heart and circulatory system, it's common for them to say that estrogen is protective, because it causes blood vessels to relax and dilate, improving circulation and preventing hypertension. The fact that estrogen increases the formation of nitric oxide, a vasodilator, is often mentioned as one of its beneficial effects. But in the case of hot flashes, dilation of the blood vessels is exactly the problem, and estrogen is commonly prescribed to prevent the episodic dilation of blood vessels that constitutes the hot flash. Nitric oxide increases in women in association with the menopause (Watanabe, et al., 2000), and it is increased by inflammation, and hot flushes are associated with various mediators of inflammation, but, as far as I can tell, no one has measured the production of nitric oxide during a hot flash. Inhibitors of nitric oxide formation reduce vasodilation during hot flushes (Hubing, et al., 2010).Starting in the 1940s, the doctrine that menopause is the result of changes in the ovaries, involving a depletion of eggs and an associated loss of estrogen production, was widely taught to medical students. By the 1970s, the taboo against discussing menopause publicly was fading, and the mass media began teaching the public that hot flashes are the result of an estrogen deficiency, and that \"estrogen replacement\" is the most appropriate and effective treatment, and in the next 20 years almost half the women in the US began taking it around the time of menopause. This practice became routine at a time when \"evidence based medicine\" was being promoted as a new standard, but there was no evidence that women experiencing hot flashes were deficient in estrogen (in fact, there was evidence that they weren't), and there was evidence that hot flashes began when the first menstrual period was missed, which coincided with, and resulted from, a failure to produce a functional corpus luteum, preventing the production of a normal amount of progesterone. But the silly old doctrine of deficiency is often restated by professors, as if there was no doubt about it (for example, Rance, 2009; Bhattacharya and Keating, 2012).This extremely persistent disregard for important evidence about the nature of menopause and its symptoms was guided by the estrogen industry, which began in the 1930s to call estrogen \"the female hormone,\" disregarding the facts about the biological roles of estrogen and progesterone, because chemicals with estrogenic effects were numerous and cheap, while progesterone was expensive, and had no synthetic equivalents. At the time the pharmaceutical industry began promoting estrogen as the female hormone to prevent miscarriage, it was already well known that it could produce abortion, as well as causing inflammation and cancer, and some of the most famous estrogen researchers were warning of its multiple dangers in the 1930s.Menopause is a major landmark of aging, and if its meaning is radically misunderstood, a coherent understanding of aging is unlikely, and without an understanding of the loss of functions with age, we won't really understand life. More specifically, the real causes of the many serious problems occurring in association with the menopause will be ignored. Finding the causes of the seemingly trivial hot flash will affect the way we understand aging and its diseases.If a common occurrence is thought to have some importance in itself, or to relate closely to something of importance, it will be described carefully, and its general features will become part of the common understanding. It's clear that our medical culture hasn't considered the hot flash to be important, because there are still physicians who believe that the hot flash represents a rise of body temperature caused by a sudden increase of heat production, which they sometimes explain as an upward fluctuation of thyroid gland activity. Measurement of body temperature before and during hot flashes has shown clearly that the internal temperature is lowered slightly by the hot flash, as heat is lost from the skin, as a result of vasodilation. Physiologists have been studying the differences in temperature regulation between men and women, and the effects of hormones on temperature regulation, for more than 70 years, but the medical profession in the United States showed almost no interest in the subject for about 50 years.August Weismann's doctrine of \"mortal soma, immortal germ line,\" led people to postulate that \"primordial germ\" cells migrated into the ovary (consisting of \"somatic\" cells) during embryonic development, and that the baby was born with a supply of germ cells that was used up during the reproductive lifetime, accounting for the decline of fertility with aging. The fact that menstrual cycles ended around the time that fertility ended was explained by the idea that ovulation caused the release of estrogen, and that the absence of eggs caused a failure to produce estrogen, and that the absence of estrogen led to the failure of the cyclical uterine changes. It was all deduced from a mistaken ideology about the nature of life.Cancer of the endometrium (lining) of the uterus and breast cancer were known to be the first and second cancers, respectively, produced by uninterrupted exposure to estrogen (for example, Lipshutz, 1950). Investigation of the causes of endometrial cancer showed that women with anovulatory cycles, that failed to produce progesterone, or who had a reduced production of progesterone, developed overgrowth of the endometrium, and that these were the women who were later most likely to develop cancer of the endometrium. The peak incidence of endometrial cancer is in the postmenopausal years, resulting from prolonged exposure to estrogen, unopposed by progesterone. The medical belief* that \"ovulation produces estrogen,\" and that the absence of menstruation means an absence of estrogen, has been very harmful to women's health.Several laboratories, from the 1950s through the 1980s, investigated the causes of age-related infertility. A.L. Soderwall, among others, demonstrated that an excess of estrogen makes it impossible for the uterus to maintain a pregnancy.Subsequently, his lab showed that neither changes in the eggs nor changes in the uterus could explain age related infertility. Altered pituitary hormone cycles, resulting from changes in the brain, could account for the major changes in the ovaries and uterus.Other experimenters, including P.M. Wise, V.M. Sopelak and R.L. Butcher (1982), P. Ascheim (1983), and D.C. Desjardins (1995) have clarified the interactions between the ovaries and the brain. For example, when the ovaries of an old animal are transplanted into a young animal, they are able to function in response to the new environment, but when the ovaries of a young animal are transplanted into an old animal, they fail to cycle. However, if the ovaries are removed from an animal when it's young, so that it lives to the normal age of infertility without being regularly exposed to surges of estrogen, it will then be able to support normal cycles when young ovaries are transplanted into it. But if it received estrogen supplements throughout its life, transplanted young ovaries will fail to cycle.The work of Desjardins and others has demonstrated that free radicals generated by interactions of estrogen and iron with unsaturated fatty acids are responsible for damage to brain cells (Desjardins, et al., 1992). The damaged inhibitory nerve cells allow the pituitary to remain in a chronically active state; in old rats, this can produce a state of constant estrus. Several groups (Powers, et al., 2006; Everitt, et al., 1980; Telford, et al., 1986) have shown that removal of the pituitary gland can greatly extend lifespan, if thyroid hormone is supplemented.One of the animal \"models\" used to study hot flashes is morphine withdrawal.  The model seems relevant to human hot flashes, because estrogen can stop the morphine withdrawal flushing, and estrogen's acute and chronic effects on the brain-pituitary-ovary system involve the endorphins and the opioidergic nerves (Merchenthaler, et al., 1998; Holinka, et al., 2008).In young rats, sudden morphine withdrawal caused by injecting the anti-opiate naloxone, causes the tail skin to flush, with a temperature increase of a few degrees, and causes the core body temperature to fall slightly. However, old animals respond to the withdrawal in two different ways. One group responded to the naloxone with an exaggerated flushing and decrease of core temperature. The other group of old rats, which already had a lower body temperature, didn't flush at all (Simpkins, 1994). I think this provides an insight into the reason that menopausal treatment with estrogen can relieve some hot flashes--estrogen treatment might create a flush resistant state similar to that of the cooler old animals in Simpkins' experiment.It has been known for a long time, from studies in animals and people, that estrogen lowers body temperature, and that this involves a tendency to increase blood flow to the skin in response to a given environmental temperature, that is, the temperature \"set-point\" is lowered by estrogen. Besides increasing heat loss, estrogen decreases heat production. These physiological effects of estrogen can be seen in the normal menstrual cycle, with progesterone having the opposite effect of estrogen on metabolic rate, skin circulation, body temperature, and heat loss. This causes the familiar rise in temperature when ovulation occurs. Occasionally, young women will experience hot flashes during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle because of insufficient progesterone production, or at menstruation, when the corpus luteus stops producing progesterone.Estrogen increases the free fatty acids circulating in the blood, and this shifts metabolism away from oxidation of glucose to oxidation of fat, and it also reduces oxidative metabolism, for example by lowering thyroid function (Vandorpe and Kühn, 1989). These changes are analogous to those of fasting, in which metabolism shifts to the oxidation of fatty acids for energy, causes decreased body temperature, and in some animals leads to a state of torpor or hibernation.Despite decreasing oxidative metabolism, estrogen stimulates the adrenal cortex, both directly and indirectly through the brain and pituitary, increasing the production of cortisol. Cortisol, by increasing protein turnover, can increase heat production, but this effect isn't necessarily sufficient to maintain a normal body temperature. It increases blood glucose, mainly by blocking its use for energy production, but the glucose is derived from the breakdown of muscle protein. It allows some glucose to be stored as fat. Sudden increases in the amount of glucose can lower adrenaline, and chronically excessive cortisol tends to suppress adrenaline. Cushing's syndrome (produced by excessive cortisol) commonly involves flushing and depression, both of which are likely to be related to the decreased action of adrenaline.While the biological changes occurring at menopause and during hot flashes are very similar to some of the direct actions of estrogen, and although the menopause itself is the result of prolonged exposure to estrogen, very large doses of estrogen can, in many women (as well as in morphine addicted rats), stop the flushing. In some of the published animal experiments, effective doses of estrogen were about 2000 times normal, and in some human studies, the dose was 30 times normal. By blocking the production of heat, the estrogen treatments might be creating conditions similar to those in Simpkin's cooler old rats, which failed to flush during morphine withdrawal. Menopausal estrogen treatment is known to lower temperature (Brooks, et al., 1994).Since the Women's Health Initiative publicized the dangers of estrogen, there has been some interest in alternative treatments for hot flashes. Since a reduced production of progesterone has been associated with hot flushes for several decades, it isn't surprising that it is now being tested as an alternative to estrogen. Recently, 300 mg of oral progesterone was found to be effective for decreasing hot flashes, and a month after discontinuing it, the hot flushes were still less frequent than before using it (Prior and Hitchcock, 2012). Previously, transdermal progesterone was found to be effective (Leonetti, et al., 1999).One of the things progesterone does is to stabilize blood sugar. In one experiment, hot flashes were found to be increased by lowering blood sugar, and decreased by moderately increasing blood sugar (Dormire and Reame, 2003).Hypoglycemia increases the brain hormone, corticotropin release hormone, CRH (Widmaier, et al., 1988), which increases ACTH and cortisol. CRH causes vasodilation (Clifton, et al., 2005), and is more active in the presence of estrogen. Menopausal women are more responsive to its effects, and those with the most severe hot flushes are the most responsive (Yakubo, et al., 1990).The first reaction to a decrease of blood glucose, at least in healthy individuals, is to increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, with an increase of adrenaline, which causes the liver to release glucose from its glycogen stores. The effect of adrenaline on the liver is very quick, but adrenaline also acts on the brain, stimulating CRH, which causes the pituitary to secrete ACTH, which stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol, which by various means causes blood sugar to increase, consequently causing the sympathetic nervous activity to decrease. Even when the liver's glycogen stores are adequate, the system cycles rhythmically, usually repeating about every 90 minutes throughout the day.Sympathetic nervous activity typically causes vasoconstriction in the skin and extremities, reducing heat loss, but the small cycles in the system normally aren't noticed, except as small changes in alertness or appetite. With advancing age, most tissues become less sensitive to adrenaline and the sympathetic nervous stimulation, and the body relies increasingly on the production of cortisol to maintain blood glucose. Many of the changes occurring around the menopause, such as the rise of free fatty acids and decrease of glucose availability, increase the sensitivity of the CRH nerves, causing the fluctuations of the adrenergic system to cause larger increases of ACTH and cortisol. Estrogen is another factor that increases the sensitivity of the CRH nerves, and unsaturated fatty acids (Widmaier, et al. 1995) and serotonin (Buckingham, et al., 1982) are other factors stimulating it. Serotonin, like noradrenalin, rises with hypoglycemia (Vahabzadeh, et al., 1995), and estrogen contributes to hypoglycemia, by impairing the counterregulatory system (Cheng and Mobbs, 2009).With the reduced vasoconstrictive effects of the sympathetic nerves, and the increased activity of CRH, cyclic vasodilation under the influence of cortisol will become more noticeable. With the onset of menopause, and in proportion to the number and intensity of symptoms (on the Greene Climacteric Scale), the daily secretion of cortisol was increased (Cagnacci, et al., 2011).Once the ideologically based doctrine of menopause as estrogen deficiency is discarded, it's possible to see its features as clues to the ways in which \"stress\" contributes to the age-related degeneration of the various systems of the body--not just the reproductive system, but also the immune system, the nutritive, growth, and repair processes, and the motivational, emotional, and cognitive processes of the nervous systems. The changes around menopause aren't the same for all women, but the ways in which they vary can be understood in terms of the basic biological principles of energy and adaptation that are universal.Each type of cell and organ is subject to injury, and in some cases these injuries are cumulative. In the healthy liver, which stores glycogen, toxins can be inactivated, for example by combining with glucuronic acid, derived from the stored glucose. With injury, such as alcoholism combined with a diet containing polyunsaturated fats, the liver's detoxifying ability is reduced. Even at an early stage, before there is a significant amount of fibrosis, the reduced activity of the liver causes estrogen to accumulate in the body. Estrogen's valuable actions are, in health, exerted briefly, and then the synthesis of estrogen is stopped, and its excretion reduces its activity, but when the liver's function is impaired, estrogen's activity continues, causing further deterioration of liver function, as well as injury of nerves such as Desjardins described, and the systemic energy shifts and stress activations mentioned above.Besides lowering the liver's detoxifying ability, stress, hypoglycemia, malnutrition, hypothyroidism, and aging can cause estrogen to be synthesized inappropriately and continuously. With aging, estrogen begins to be produced throughout the body--in fat, muscles, skin, bones, brain, liver, breast, uterus, etc. Polyunsaturated fats are a major factor in the induction and activation of the aromatase enzyme, which synthesizes estrogen.Increased synthesis of estrogen, with aromatase, and decreased excretion of it, by the liver and kidneys, are only two of the processes that affect the influence of estrogen during aging. Cellular stress (chemical, mechanical, hypoxemic, hypoglycemic [Clere, et al., 2012; Aguirre, et al., 2007, Zaman, et al., 2006, Saxon, et al., 2007; Tamir, et al., 2002; Briski, et al., 2010]) increases estrogen receptors (which activate CRH and the stress response). The presence of estrogen receptors means that estrogen will be bound inside cells, where it acts to modify those cells. Before estrogen can reach the liver to be inactivated, it must be released from cells. Ordinarily, the cyclic production of progesterone has that function, by destroying the estrogen-binding proteins. Progesterone also inhibits the aromatase which synthesizes estrogen, and shifts the activities of other enzymes, including sulfatases and dehydrogenates, in a comprehensive process of eliminating the presence and activity of estrogen. At menopause, when the ovary fails to produce the cyclic progesterone, all of these processes of estrogen inactivation fail. In the absence of progesterone, cortisol becomes more active, increasing aromatase activity, which now becomes chronic and progressive. The decrease of progesterone causes many other changes, including the increased conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids to prostaglandins, and the formation of nitric oxide, all of which contribute to the tendency to flush.=========================*The limits of the belief system or consciousness of US medicine are nicely defined by the topics included in the Index Medicus, which was published from 1879 to 2004, by the Surgeon General's Office of the U.S. Army, the American Medical Association, and the National Library of Medicine, at different times. If you look up any important topic in physiology or biochemistry in an index of scientific publications such as Biological Abstracts or Chemical Abstracts, and then look for the same subject in the Index Medicus, you will find some startling differences--long delays and antagonistic attitudes. At first the discrepancies seem ludicrous and hard to account for, but I think they can be explained by recognizing that the editors of medical journals consider science to be their enemy.REFERENCESJ Biol Chem. 2007 Aug 31;282(35):25501-8.

        "chunk_html": "MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND OTHER HORMONE-RELATED BRAIN SYNDROMES (1993)Since I am trying to discuss a complex matter in a single article, I have separately outlined the essential technical points of the argument in a section at the beginning, then I explain how my ideas on the subject developed, and finally there is a glossary.  If you start with \"Short-day brain stress,\" \"Estrogen's effects,\" and \"Symptoms and therapies,\" you will have the general picture, and can use the other sections to fill in the technical details.THE ARGUMENT:1) The hormones pregnenolone, thyroid, and estrogen are involved in several ways with the changes that occur in multiple sclerosis, but no one talks about them.2) The process of myelination is known to depend on the thyroid hormone.  The myelinating cells are the oligodendroglia (oligodendrocytes) which appear to stop functioning in MS (and  sometimes to a milder degree in Alzheimer's disease, and other  conditions).  The cells' absorption of thyroid hormone is influenced by dietary factors.3) The oligodendrocytes are steroid-producing cells (1),  and steroidogenesis is dependent on thyroid hormone, and on  thyroid-dependent respiratory enzymes and on the heme-enzyme P-450scc, which are all sensitive (2) to poisoning by carbon monoxide and cyanide.  The steroid produced by the oligodendrocytes is pregnenolone, which is known to have a profound  anti-stress action (3), and which appears to be the main  brain-protective steroid.4) Lesions resembling those of MS can be produced experimentally by carbon monoxide or cyanide poisoning.(4)  The lesions  tend to be associated with individual small blood vessels, which   are likely to contain clots.  (Since all animals have enzymes to  detoxify cyanide, this poison is apparently a universal problem,  and can originate in the bowel. \"Detoxified\" cyanide is still toxic to the thyroid.)5) Pregnenolone and progesterone protect against nerve damage (5) by the excitotoxic amino acids (glutamic acid, aspartic acid, monosodium glutamate, aspartame, etc.), while estrogen (6) and cortisol (7) are nerve-destroying, acting through the excitotoxic amino acids.  Excitotoxins destroy certain types of nerve, especially the dopaminergic and cholinergic types, leaving the noradrenergic types (8), paralleling the changes that occur in aging.  The clustering of oligodendrocytes around deteriorating nerve cells could represent an adaptive attempt to provide pregnenolone to injured nerve cells.6) The involvement of hormones and environmental factors probably accounts for the intermittent progress of multiple sclerosis. To the extent that the environmental factors can be  corrected, the disease can probably be controlled.SHORT-DAY BRAIN STRESSShortly after I moved from Mexico to Montana, one of my students, a 32 year old woman, began having the same sensory symptoms her older sister had experienced at the same age, at the onset of multiple sclerosis.  Vertigo and visual distortions of some sort made her consider withdrawing from the university. I'm not sure why she tried eating a whole can of tuna for lunch a couple of days after the onset of symptoms, but it seemed to alleviate the symptoms, and she stayed on a high protein diet and never had a recurrence.  She told me some of the lore of MS: That it mostly affects young adults between the ages of 20 and 40, that it is common in high latitudes and essentially unknown in the tropics, and that it is sometimes exacerbated by pregnancy and stress.  (Later, I learned that systemic lupus erythematosis and other \"auto-immune\" diseases also tend to occur mainly during the reproductive years.  I discussed some of the implications of this in \"Bean Syndrome.\")Having enjoyed the mild climate of Mexico, I became very conscious of the harm done to us by northern winters, and began developing the idea of \"winter sickness.\"  In 1966-67, allergies, PMS, weight gain, colitis, and arthritis came to my attention as winter-related problems, and I assumed that the high-latitude incidence of MS related to what I was seeing and experiencing.  Studies in Leningrad began revealing that mitochondria are injured during darkness, and repaired during daylight.  I observed that hamsters' thymus glands shrank in the winter and regenerated in the summer; shrinkage of the thymus gland is a classical feature of stress, and usually reflects the dominance of cortisone, though estrogen and testosterone also cause it to shrink.  Winter's darkness is stressful in a very fundamental way, and like any stress it tends to suppress thyroid function.  In the hypothyroid state, any estrogen which is produced tends to accumulate in the body, because of liver sluggishness.I began to see that PMS could be controlled by certain things--extra light, supplements of sodium and magnesium, high quality protein, and correction of deficiencies of thyroid and progesterone.  In working on my dissertation, I saw that tissue hypoxia (lower than optimal concentrations of oxygen in the blood) may result from estrogen excess, vitamin E deficiency, or aging.  There is a close biological parallel between estrogen-dominance and the other hypoxic states, such as stress/shock, and aging.ESTROGEN'S EFFECTSAs a portrait painter, I had been very conscious of the blue aspect that can often be seen in the skin of young women. In pale areas, the color may actually be blue, and in areas with a rich supply of blood, such as the lips, the color is lavender during times of high estrogen influence--around ovulation and puberty, for example.  During these times of estrogen dominance, the blood is not only poorly oxygenated, but it has other special properties, such as an increased tendency to clot.  The Shutes' work in the 1930s began with the use of vitamin E to antagonize estrogen's clot-promoting tendency, and led them to the discovery that vitamin E can be very therapeutic in heart disease.  More recently, it has been found that men with heart disease have abnormally high estrogen (9), that women using oral contraceptives have higher mortality from heart attacks (10), and that estrogen tends to  promote spasm of blood vessels (11).  (These reactions are probably  related to the physiology of menstruation, in which progesterone withdrawal causes spasms in the spiral arteries of the uterus,  producing endometrial anoxia and cell death.)In toxemia of late pregnancy, or eclampsia, the exaggerated clotting tendency caused by excess estrogen (or by inadequately opposed estrogen, i.e., progesterone deficiency), can cause convulsions and strokes.  Vascular spasms could be involved here, too.  The stasis caused by the vasospasm would facilitate clotting. (Vascular spasm has been observed in epilepsy, too.  Epilepsy can be brought on by the premenstrual excess of estrogen, and in that situation there is no evidence that clotting is involved.  Leakage of hemoglobin out of red cells can cause vasospasm, so bleeding, clotting, strokes, and seizures can interact complexly.)  The brains of women who have died following eclampsia show massive clotting in the blood vessels, and their livers are characteristically injured, with clots (12).Tom Brewer and others have shown very clearly that malnutrition, especially protein deficiency, is the cause of toxemia of late pregnancy.  (In Nutrition for Women, I discussed the importance of protein in allowing the liver to eliminate estrogen.)Various researchers have demonstrated that the plaques of MS usually occur in the area served by a single blood vessel (13, 14), and some have suggested that clotting is the cause.  MS patients have been found to have an abnormal clotting time, and it has been suggested that an altered diet might be able to correct the clotting tendency.Studies in animals have shown clearly that a protein deficiency increases the fibrinogen content of blood. (Field and Dam, 1946.)  Other factors that increase blood clotting are elevated adrenalin and cortisone.  Protein deficiency causes an adaptive decrease in thyroid function, which leads to a compensatory increase in adrenaline and cortisone.  The combination of high estrogen with high adrenaline increases the tendency for both clots and spasms of the blood vessels (11).In experimental poisoning of animals with carbon monoxide or cyanide, the brain lesions resembling MS include blood clots.  The patchy distribution of these spots in the brain suggests that the clotting is secondary to metabolic damage in the brain.  Presumably, the same would be true in ordinary MS, with clots and spasms being induced in certain areas by metabolic abnormalities in brain cells.  The injured cells that are responsible for myelination of nerve fibers are steroid-forming cells.  A failure to secrete their protective pregnenolone could cause a local spasm of a blood vessel.  The circulatory problem would exacerbate the respiratory problem. Steroid production is dependent on NADH and NADPH, and so requires adequate energy supplies and energy metabolism.  The phenomenon of blood-sludging, studied by M. Knisely at the University of Chicago in the l930s and l940s, is apparently a general result of decreased energy metabolism, and is likely to be a factor in energy-and-circulatory vicious circles.SYMPTOMS AND THERAPIESAround 1976 I met a woman in her mid-thirties who heard about my work with progesterone in animals.  She had been disabled by a brain disease that resembled MS or Devic's disease, inflammation of the optic nerves.  It would sometimes cause blindness and paralysis that persisted for weeks at a time.  During remissions, sometimes using a wheelchair, she would go to the medical school library to try to understand her condition.  She came across Katherina Dalton's work with progesterone, and convinced a physician to give her a trial injection.  Although she had trouble finding people who were willing to give her progesterone, her recovery was so complete that she was able to climb stairs and drive her car, and she came  to my endocrinology class and gave a very good (and long) lecture on progesterone therapy.  Although her sensory and motor functions became normal, she remained very fat, and chronically suffered from sore areas on her arms and legs that seemed to be abnormal blood vessels, possibly with phlebitis.  She appeared to need thyroid hormone as well as larger amounts of progesterone, but never found a physician who would cooperate, as far as I know.In the late 1970s I was seeing a lot of people who had puzzling health problems.  In a period of two or three years, there were five people who had been diagnosed by neurologists as having multiple sclerosis.  In talking to them, it seemed clear that they had multiple symptoms of hypothyroidism.   They weren't severely disabled.  Since they weren't fat or lethargic, their physicians hadn't thought they could be hypothyroid.  When they tried taking a thyroid supplement, all of their symptoms disappeared, including those that had led to their MS diagnosis.  One of the women went to her doctor to tell him that she felt perfectly healthy since taking thyroid, and he told her to stop taking it, because people who have MS need a lot of rest, and she wouldn't get enough rest if she was living in a normally active way. The assumption seemed to be that the diagnosis was more important than the person. (When I refer to a \"thyroid supplement\" I mean one that contains some T3.  Many people experience \"neurological symptoms\" when they take thyroxine by itself.  Experimentally, it has been found to suppress brain respiration, probably by diluting the T3 that was already present in the brain tissue.)METABOLISM OF THE OLIGODENDROCYTESThe rate-regulating step in steroid synthesis involves the entry of cholesterol into the mitochondria, where the heme-enzyme P-450scc then removes the side-chain of cholesterol  (by introducing oxygen atoms), to produce pregnenolone.  This enzyme can be poisoned by carbon monoxide or cyanide, and light can eliminate the poison (15); this could be one aspect of the winter-sickness problem.Peripheral nerves are myelinated by essentially the same sort of cell that is called an oligodendrocyte in the brain, but outside the brain it is called a Schwann cell.  It is easier to study the myelin sheath in peripheral nerves, and the electrical activity of a nerve is the most easily studied aspect of its physiology.  Certain experiments seemed to indicate a \"jumping\" (saltatory) kind of conduction along the nerve between Schwann cells, and it was argued that the insulating function of the myelin sheath made this kind of conduction possible.  This idea has become a standard item in physiology textbooks, and its familiarity leads many people to assume that the presence of myelin sheaths in the brain serves the same \"insulating\" function.For a long time it has been known that heat production during nerve conduction reveals a more continuous mode of  conduction, that doesn't conform to the idea of an electrical  current jumping around an insulator.  Even if the myelin functioned primarily to produce \"saltatory conduction\" in peripheral nerves, it isn't clear how this process could function in the brain.  I think of the issue of \"saltatory conduction at the nodes of Ranvier\" as another of the fetish ideas that have served to obstruct progress in biology in the United States.  A more realistic approach to nerve function can be found in Gilbert Ling's work.  Ling has demonstrated in many ways that the ruling dogma of \"cell membrane\" function isn't coherently based on fact.  He found that hormones such as progesterone regulate the energetic and structural stability of cells.  Many people, unaware of his work, have felt that it was necessary to argue against the idea that there are anesthetic steroids with generalized protective functions, because of their commitment to a textbook dogma of \"cell membrane\" physiology.I think the myelinating cells do have relevance to nerve conduction, but I don't think they serve primarily as electrical insulators.  If the adrenal cortex were inside the heart, it would be obvious to ask whether its hormones aren't important for the heart's function.  Since the oligodendrocytes are steroid-synthesizers, it seems obvious to ask whether their production of pregnenolone in response to stress or fatigue isn't relevant to the conduction processes of the nerves they surround.OLD AGEA biologist friend of mine who was about 85 became very senile.  His wife started giving him thyroid, progesterone, DHEA and pregnenolone, and within a few days his mental clarity had returned.  He continued to be mentally active until he was 89, when his wife interfered with his access to the hormones.In old age the brain steroids fall to about 5% of their level in youth.  Pregnenolone and DHEA improve memory in old rats, and improve mood stability and mental clarity of old people.  Pregnenolone's action in improving the sense of being able to cope with challenges probably reflects a quieting and coordinating of the \"sequencing\" apparatus of the forebrain, which is the area most sensitive to energy deprivation.  This is the area that malfunctions in hyperactive and \"dyslexic\" children.  Weakening of the sequencing and sorting processes probably explains the common old-age inability to extract important sounds from environmental noise, creating a kind of \"confusion deafness.\"  Insomnia, worry and \"restless legs\" at bedtime are problems for many old people, and I think they are variations of the basic energy-depletion problem.The oligodendrocytes were reported (Hiroisi and Lee, 1936) to be the source of the senile plaques or amyloid deposits of Alzheimer's disease.(16)  Hiroisi and Lee showed the cells in different stages of degeneration, ending with translucent \"mucoid\" spots that stained the same as amyloid, the material in the senile plaques.  This type of cell also appears to form a halo or crown around degenerating nerve cells--possibly in a protective reaction to provide the nerve cell  with any pregnenolone the oligodendrocytes are able to make.  The  oligodendrocytes, the source of the brain steroids (that people previously believed came from the adrenals and gonads, and were just stored in the brain), myelinate nerve fibers under the  influence of thyroid hormone (17).  Thyroid is responsible for both myelination and hormone formation.  In old age, glial cells become more numerous, and nerve cells become structurally  and functionally abnormal, but usually there is no problem  with the formation of myelin.  In MS, the problem is just with  myelination, and there are no senile plaques or defects in the  nerve cells themselves.These differences suggest the possibility that Alzheimer's  disease involves a specific premature loss of brain pregnen-  olone production, but not of thyroid.  Recent work suggests a central role for pregnenolone and progesterone in the regulation of consciousness (18), and possibly in the brain's detoxifying system.  Elsewhere, I have suggested that vitamin A deficiency might cause the excessive production of the \"amyloid\" protein.  A vitamin A deficiency severely inhibits steroid synthesis.  (It is used so massively in steroid synthesis that a progesterone supplement can prevent the symptoms of vitamin A deficiency.)  I suspect that vitamin A is necessary for the side-chain cleavage that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone.  Iron-stimulated lipid peroxidation is known to block steroid formation, and vitamin A is very susceptible to destruction  by iron and oxidation.  Iron tends to accumulated in tissues  with aging.  Gajdusek has demonstrated that brain deterioration  is associated with the retention of whatever metal happens to be abundant in the person's environment, not just with aluminum.  (One type of glial cell is known for its metal-binding function, causing them to be called \"metallophils.\").  According to Gajdusek, \"calcium and other di- and trivalent elements\" are \"deposited as hydroxyapatites in brain cells\" in brain degeneration of the Alzheimer's type.(19)Even early forms of Alzheimer's disease begin at an age  when the youth-associated steroids have begun to decline. If  MS involves a deficiency of thyroid (or of T3 within the oligodendrocytes, where T3 normally can be made from thyroxine; many things, including protein deficiency, can block the conversion of T4 to T3), those cells would necessarily be deficient in their ability to produce pregenolone, but in  young people the brain would still be receiving a little pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA from the adrenals and gonads.  This relatively abundant youthful supply of hormones would keep most of the body's organs in good condition,  and could keep the bodies of the major brain cells from deteriorating. But if proper functioning of the nerve fibers requires that they be fed a relatively high concentration of pregnenolone from their immediately adjacent neighbors (with the amount increasing during stress and fatigue), then their function would be impaired when they had to depend on the hormones that arrived from the blood stream.For many years it has been recognized that the brain atrophy of \"Alzheimer's disease\" resembles the changes seen in the brain in many other situations:  The traumatic dementia of boxers; toxic dementia; the slow-virus diseases; exposure of the brain to x-rays (20); ordinary old age; and in people with Down's syndrome who die around the age of thirty.In menopause, certain nerve cells have lost their ability to regulate the ovaries, because of prolonged exposure to estrogen (6).  The cells that fail as a result of prolonged estrogen exposure aren't the same cells that fail from prolonged exposure to the glucocorticoids (7), but they have in common the factor of excitatory injury.Since people who experience premature menopause are known to be more likely than average to die prematurely, it is reasonable to view menopause as a model of the aging process. It is now well established that progesterone fails to be produced at the onset of menopause (the first missed period, increased loss of calcium, symptoms such as hot flashes, etc.), and that estrogen continues to be produced at monthly intervals for about four years.  The essential question for aging, in the present context, is why the anesthetic steroids are no longer produced at a rate that allows them to protect tissues, including brain cells, from the excitotoxins.  Using menopause as a model for aging, we can make the question more answerable by asking why progesterone stops being produced.During stress, we are designed not to get pregnant, and the simplest aspect of this is that ACTH, besides stimulating the adrenals to produce stress-related hormones, inhibits the production of progesterone by the ovary.  Other stress-induced factors, such as increased prolactin and decreased thyroid, also inhibit progesterone production.  Stress eventually makes us more susceptible to stress.  Menopause and other landmarks of aging simply represent upward inflections in the rate-of-aging curve.  Individual variations in type of stress, hormonal response and diet, etc., probably govern the nature of the aging process in an individual.The amphetamine-like action of estrogen, which undoubtedly  contributes to the general level of stress and excitotoxic  abuse of nerve cells, is probably the only \"useful\" facet of  estrogen treatment, but a little cocaine might achieve the  same effect with no more harm, possibly less.  The toxicity of catecholamines has been known for over thirty years, and estrogen's stimulating effects are partly the result of its conversion to catechol-estrogens which increase the activity of brain catecholamines.  Estrogen's powerful ability to nullify learning seems never to be mentioned by the people who promote its use.  The importance of a good balance of brain steroids for mood, attention, memory, and reasoning is starting to be recognized, but powerful economic forces militate against its general acceptance.Since the brain is the organ that can allow us to adapt without undergoing stress in the hormonal sense, it is very important to protect its flexibility and to keep its energy level high, so it can work in a relaxed way.  It is the low energy cellular state that leads to the retention of calcium and iron, and to the production of age pigment, and other changes that constitute the vicious circle of aging.  And mental activity that challenges obsession and rigidity might be the most important brain energizer.  Pseudo-optimism, humor-as-therapy, has a certain value, but a deeper optimism involves a willingness to assimilate new information and to change plans accordingly.SUPPLEMENTSNutritional supplements that might help to prevent or correct these brain syndromes include: Vitamin E and  coconut oil; vitamin A; magnesium, sodium; thyroid which  includes T3; large amounts of animal protein, especially  eggs; sulfur, such as magnesium sulfate or flowers of  sulfur, but not to take continuously, because of sulfur's interference with copper absorption; pregnenolone; progesterone if needed.  Bright light, weak in the blue end of the spectrum and with protection against ultraviolet, activates respiratory metabolism and quenches free radicals.  Raw carrot fiber and/or laxatives if needed; charcoal occasionally for gas or bowel  irritation.  Coconut oil serves several purposes.  Its butyric acid is known to increase T3 uptake by glial cells.  It has a general pro-thyroid action, for example by diluting and displacing antithyroid unsaturated oils, its short- and medium-chain fatty acids sustain blood sugar and have antiallergic actions, and it protects mitochondria against stressinjury.P.S.:  In 1979, a woman whose husband was suffering from advanced Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) asked me if I had any ideas for slowing his decline.  I described my suspicion that ALS involved defective metabolism or regulation of testosterone.  In some tissues, testosterone is selectively concentrated to prevent atrophy, and ALS is a disease of middle-age, when hormone regulation often becomes a special problem.  In the late 1970s, there was discussion of a higher incidence of ALS in males, and especially in athletes.  I told her about progesterone's general protective effects, its antagonism to testosterone, and its prevention of atrophy in various tissues.  She decided to ask her doctor to try progesterone for her husband.  Later, I learned that her husband had gone into a very rapid decline immediately after the injection, and died within a week; the physician had given him testosterone, since, he said, \"testosterone and progesterone are both male hormones.\"  Besides making me more aware of the problems patients have in communicating with physicians, this tended to reinforce my feeling that a hormone imbalance is involved in ALS.  Although I haven't written much about testosterone's toxicity, Marian Diamond's work showed that prenatal testosterone is similar to prenatal estrogen, in causing decreased thickness of the cortex of the brain; both of those hormones oppose progesterone's brain-protecting and brain-promoting actions.REFERENCES1)  Z.

Other Cyt P450 enzymes are important for their detoxifying oxidizing action, and some of these are involved in brain metabolism.3.  Glial means \"glue-like,\" and glial cells are mostly spidery-shaped cells that used to be thought of as just connective, supportive cells in the brain.4.  Mitochondria (the \"thread-like bodies\") are the structures in cells which produce most of our metabolic energy by respiration, in response to the thyroid hormones.5.  Mucoid--refers to a mucoprotein, a protein which contains some carbohydrate.  A glycoprotein; usually not intended as a precise term.6.  Myelination.  Myelin is a multilayered enclosure of the axons (the long processes) of nerve cells, composed of proteins and complex lipids, including cholesterol.  The layered material is a flat, thin extension of the cytoplasm of the oligodendroglial cells.7.  Oligodendrocytes are one of the kinds of glial (or neuroglial) cells, and structurally they are unusual in having sheet-like, rather than just thread-like processes; they have a sensitivity (\"receptors\") to stress and valium, and produce pregnenolone when activated.  Under the influence of thyroid hormone, they wrap themselves in thin layers around the conductive parts of nerve cells, leaving a multilayered \"myelin\" coating.  Their absorption of thyroid hormone is promoted by butyrate, an anti-stress substance found in butter and coconut oil.8.  Steroidogenesis is the creation of steroids, usually referring to the conversion of cholesterol to hormones.© Ray Peat Ph.D. 2013.

        "chunk_html": "When energy fails: Edema, heart failure, hypertension, sarcopenia, etc.More than 100 years ago the idea of a morphogenetic field was proposed by A.G. Gurwitsch, as a way to explain the orderly movements of cells in embryos and growing tissues, and to understand the principles that cause cells to change appropriately when their location in the organism changes. For 30 years, the concept guided research in embryology, but also led to important discoveries in the biology of cancer, aging, wound repair, and other important areas. But by the late 1940s, a more abstract approach to biology, based on the gene doctrine of Mendel and Weismann, took charge of academic and governmental biological research. This ideology at first said that organisms are determined by unchanging units of inheritance, \"genes,\" and later when genes were found to be susceptible to mutation, the changes were said to be always random. The Central Dogma of the ideology was that any meaningful, adaptive changes that occur in an organism can't influence the genes. For many years, adaptive changes were said to be nothing but changes in the size or function of existing cells, because the cells of the major organs of the body were supposed to be created before birth, or in infancy.Besides the purely ideological commitment to the theory of genes, there were other influences that contributed to the culture of Molecular Biology. People learned histology from slides or pictures made by killing, hardening, dehydrating, and slicing parts of organisms. Biochemists studied the chemistry of life mainly by grinding cells or tissues, and extracting water soluble materials to study the actions of enzymes on various materials. These unrealistic artifacts filled the textbooks and the minds of generations of biologists and physicians. The culture of molecular biology used these artifacts to create theories of embryology and physiology, and holistic ideas such as the developmental field were disregarded.The mental image of a living organism that has been created by that culture is simply wrong. The concept of a developmental field is essential for understanding embryology, because things that exist on a scale bigger than molecules and cells govern the functions of the molecules and cells, and the principles of embryology don't arbitrarily stop operating at birth, but can be seen to continue operating during maturity and aging. The interactions of cells with their environment are different at different stages of life, but there are commonalities that are extremely important.The processes that govern the pregnant woman's blood circulation, in sustaining the development of a fetus, are very similar to the processes that govern anyone's blood circulation, providing for the maintenance and renewal of all the body's organs. The common problems of pregnancy involving the circulatory system can provide insights into the problems of the various organs that have been the focus of the medical specialties, and to some basic medical issues, including aging, obesity, and inflammation.The development of a fertilized egg into an embryo consumes energy at a very high rate, and the way the embryo develops depends on a continuously adequate supply of oxygen and sugar, and other nutrients. The intense flow of energy through each stage of a developing structure shapes the following stage. The necessary energy and materials are provided abundantly by the mother's blood. When the development has advanced far enough to make life possible outside the uterus, energy will be used more slowly, for growth, maintenance, and renewal of tissues.Failure to renew cells and tissues leads to the loss of function and substance. Bones and muscles get weaker and smaller with aging. Diminished bone substance, osteopenia, is paralleled, at roughly the same rate, by the progressive loss of muscle mass, sarcopenia (or myopenia). The structure of aging tissue changes, with collagen tending to fill the spaces left by the disappearing cells. It's also common for fat cells to increase, as muscle cells disappear.When conditions are ideal, as during healthy development in the uterus, tissue damage is corrected by the multiplication of cells to replace any that were lost. But when conditions are less perfect, injuries are imperfectly repaired, usually with highly collagenous scar tissue bridging the area that was destroyed. During this imperfect repair, there is inflammation, which apparently exists to the extent that the substances needed for regeneration are lacking. For example, when oxygen is lacking, lactic acid is likely to be produced, along with increases of pro-inflammatory regulators such as histamine and serotonin, leading to the loss of many important proteins and functions, and the over-production of collagen instead.Since cellular renewal of tissues, in a healthy individual, is a constant process, we can think of the metabolic rate of a healthy adult as just what is needed to sustain this constant, limited sort of regeneration, but not quite intense enough to produce scarless healing of a wound (without special intervention).If something reduces the systemic ability to produce energy, there will be a gap between the available energy and the energy needed for the constant turnover of cells in each tissue and organ, and a generalized inflammation will develop. The replacement of cells will be slowed, and the organism will mobilize the processes used for producing scar tissue, producing an excess of collagen, filling the spaces left by the lost cells.We are susceptible to many things that interfere with energy production---the substitution of iron for copper in the respiratory enzyme, the absorption of endotoxin, the accumulation of PUFA, a deficiency of thyroid hormone, the formation of increased amounts of nitric oxide, serotonin, and histamine, etc. Different environments will condition the way the defensive mechanisms of inflammation are produced.Toxemia of pregnancy, or preeclampsia, is a state of generalized inflammation, and some of the causes and remedies are known. Despite the predominance of crazy genetic theories of preeclampsia in 20th century medical literature, there was clear evidence (reviewed by Tom Brewer, Douglas Shanklin, and Jay Hodin) that it was caused by malnutrition, and that it could be cured by adequate protein, salt, and calcium.The old medical practice of restricting salt intake during pregnancy was an important factor in causing it, so it's interesting to look at the effects of salt restriction as a treatment for hypertension.The pregnant woman's blood volume expands, to permit the supply of energy to match the needs of the embryo. If the blood volume doesn't increase, or if it decreases, as in pregnancy toxemia, her blood pressure will increase. Typically, the decrease of blood volume is accompanied by an increase in the extracellular fluid, edema, resulting from leakage of fluid through the walls of the capillaries, and albumin appears in the urine as it leaks through the capillaries in the kidneys. The amount of blood pumped by the heart, however, is increased in toxemia (Hamilton, 1952), showing that the increased blood pressure is at least partially compensating for the smaller volume of blood.A similar situation,reduced blood volume and edema, can be seen (Tarazi, 1976) in \"essential hypertension,\" the \"unexplained\" high blood pressure that occurs more often with increasing age and obesity. At the beginning of \"essential hypertension,\" the amount of blood pumped is usually greater than normal.In both situations, preeclampsia and essential hypertension, there is an increased amount of aldosterone, an adrenal steroid which allows the kidneys to retain sodium, and to lose potassium and ammonium instead. A restriction of salt in the diet causes more aldosterone to be produced, and increased salt in the diet causes aldosterone to decrease. One effect of aldosterone is to increase the production of a substance called vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, or vascular permeability factor, which causes capillaries to become leaky, and causes new blood vessels to grow.Whileincreased salt in the diet tends to lower both aldosterone and VEGF, reducing the leakiness of blood vessels,sodium also has a direct effect that tends to prevent the leakage of water and albumin out of the blood vessels, helping to maintain the blood volume which is needed to perfuse the kidneys, preventing them from producing signals to increase blood pressure and aldosterone. There is a large amount of albumin in the blood serum, and sodium ions associate with the negative electrical charges on the albumin molecule. This association causes the complex of albumin and sodium to attract a large amount of water, that is to exert osmotic or oncotic pressure. This oncotic pressure causes any excess extracellular water to be attracted into the blood vessels, preventing edema while maintaining the blood volume. When there is too little sodium, the albumin molecule itself easily leaves the blood stream along with the water.Instead of considering the significance of sodium's effects on albumin, aldosterone, and VEGF, textbooks have often talked about the factors that \"pump\" sodium, and factors that specifically regulate the movement of water. Experiments in which an excess of aldosterone is combined with a high salt intake produce increased blood pressure, and--by invoking various genes--salt is said to cause hypertension in certain people. This reasoning is hardly different from the reasoning of the drug companies in the 1950s who said that since women with toxemia have hypertension and edema, they should be treated with a diuretic and a low salt diet, to eliminate water and to reduce blood pressure.The physiological loss of sodium occurs when energy metabolism fails, as indiabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperestrogenism, and starvation.What these conditions have in common is an increased level of free fatty acids in the blood. Increased free fatty acids impair the use of glucose. The consumption of carbohydrate, like an increase of thyroid hormone, insulin, or progesterone, increases the retention of sodium; fructose is the most effective carbohydrate (Rebello, et al., 1983).The loss of sodium is often accompanied by the retention of water, reducing the osmotic pressure of the body fluids. The leakiness of blood vessels allows the extracellular fluid volume to increase, as understood in the standard definition of edema. However, when this fluid is hypo-osmotic, it will enter cells, causing them to swell. Cell swelling excites cells (Ayus, et al., 2008; Baxter, et al., 1991), and can kill them if they are unable to produce enough energy to restore their original volume, by measures including the excretion of amino acids and potassium.  Both low sodium (hyponatremia) and low osmotic pressure stimulate the adrenergic nervous system.The increase of adrenalin,f caused by a deficiency of sodium, is one of the factors that can increase blood pressure; if the tissues's glycogen stores are depleted, the adrenalin will mobilize free fatty acids from the tissues, which tends to inhibit energy production from glucose, and to increase leakiness. After I had read Tom Brewer's work on preventing or curing preeclampsia with added salt, I realized that the premenstrual syndrome involved some of the features of preeclampsia (edema, insomnia, cramps, hypertension, salt craving), so I suggested to a friend that she might try salting her food to taste, instead of trying to restrict salt to \"prevent edema.\" She immediately noticed that it prevented her monthly edema problem. For several years, all the women who tried it had similarly good results, and often mentioned that their sleep improved. I mentioned this to several people with sleep problems, and regardless of age, their sleep improved when they ate as much salt as they wanted. Around that time, several studies had shown that salt restriction increases adrenalin, and one study showed that most old people on a low sodium diet suffered from insomnia, and had unusually high adrenalin. When they ate a normal amount of salt, their adrenalin was normalized, and they slept better.It's very common for physicians who are aware of progesterone's \"anti-aldosterone\" activity to think that both estrogen and progesterone are responsible for the increased risk of sodium loss in women, especially during pregnancy, but Hans Selye demonstrated that progesterone will normalize sodium retention even when there is no aldosterone at all, following removal of the adrenal glands. It is estrogen which is responsible for the dangerous loss of sodium.The ratio of estrogen to progesterone--regardless of age or gender--is an important factor in regulating minerals and water, cell energy metabolism, and blood pressure. The ratios of many other regulatory substances (including serotonin/dopamine, glucagon/insulin, and aldosterone/cortisol+progesterone) vary according to the quality of the individual's level of adaptation to the environment. Improving the environment can shift the ratio in the direction of restoration, rather than mere survival.Gershom Zajicek and his colleagues have demonstrated an organized renewal of tissues, in which new cells are born with the division of stem cells, and \"stream\" away from their origin as they mature, and finally are shed or dissolved. A few studies have demonstrated a similar kind of migration of new cells in the brain (Eriksson, et al., 1998; Gould, et al., 1999), a process which differs by the absence of systematic dissolution of mature brain cells. While Zajicek has demonstrated the conversion of one kind of cell, such as a pancreatic ductal epithelial or acinar cell into insulin-secreting beta cells, other researchers have shown that after injury to the pancreas beta cells can be formed from glucagon-secreting alpha cells, as well as from other beta cells.Stress, increasing the need for energy, increases the formation of cortisol and free fatty acids when glucose isn't available, and those--while they provide alternative sources of energy--interfere with the ability to produce energy from glucose. Free fatty acids and cortisol can cause the insulin-secreting beta cells to die. Glucose, and insulin which allows glucose to be used for energy production, while it lowers the formation of free fatty acids, promotes the regeneration of the beta-cells. Although several research groups have demonstrated the important role of glucose in regeneration of the pancreas, and many other groups have demonstrated the destructive effect of free fatty acids on the beta cells, the mainstream medical culture still claims that \"sugar causes diabetes.\"In the adrenal glands, renewing cells stream from the capsule on the surface of the gland toward the center of the gland. The first cells to be produced in a regenerating gland are those that produce aldosterone, the next in the stream are the cortisol producing cells, and the last to be formed are the cells that produce the sex hormones, the androgens including DHEA, and progesterone. In aging, after the age of thirty, the renewal slows, but the dissolution of the sex hormone zone continues, so the proportion shifts, increasing the ratio of the aldosterone and cortisol producing cells to the layer that produces the protective androgens and progesterone (Parker, et al., 1997).Even before aldosterone was identified, progesterone's role in regulating the salts, water, and energy metabolism was known, and after the functions of aldosterone were identified, progesterone was found to protect against its harmful effects, as it protects against an excess of cortisol, estrogen, or the androgens. New anti-aldosterone drugs are available that are effective for treating hypertension and heart failure, and their similarity to progesterone is recognized.While stress typically causes the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, extreme stress, as described by Hans Selye, damages the adrenal cortex, and can cause the cells to die, leading to the death of the animal. There is evidence that it is the breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids that causes damage to the adrenal cortex in extreme stress. Although many factors influence the production of the adrenal steroids, arachidonic acid, even without being converted to prostaglandins, is an important activator of aldosterone synthesis. Adrenalin, produced in response to a lack of glucose, liberates free fatty acids from the tissues, so when the tissues contain large amounts of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, the production of aldosterone will be greater than it would be otherwise.The continuing accumulation of polyunsaturated fats in the tissues is undoubtedly important in the changing relationship between the pancreas and the adrenal glands in aging. Aspirin, which is antilipolytic, decreasing the release of free fatty acids, as well as inhibiting their conversion to prostaglandins, lowers the production of stress-induced aldosterone, and helps to lower blood pressure, if it's taken in the evening, to prevent the increase of free fatty acids during the night. Aspirin increases insulin sensitivity. A low salt diet increases the free fatty acids, leading to insulin resistance, increasing free fatty acids in the blood, and contributing to atherosclerosis (Prada, et al., 2000; Mrnka, et al., 2000; Catanozi, et al., 2003; Garg, et al., 2011).The same factors that support or interfere with cellular renewal in the pancreas and adrenal glands have similar effects in the bones, skin, skeletal and heart muscle, nervous system, liver, and other organs. In every case, the local circulation of blood is influenced by both local and systemic factors. The loss of control over the water in the body is the result of energy failure, and hypertension is one of the adaptations that helps to preserve or restore energy production.Lowering inflammation and the associated excess of free fatty acids in the blood, and improving the ability to oxidize glucose, will lower blood pressure while improving tissue renewal, but lowering blood pressure without improving energy production and use will create new problems or intensify existing problems. After 40 years the medical profession quietly retreated from their catastrophic approach to pregnancy toxemia, but in the more general problem of essential hypertension, the mistaken ideology is being preserved, even as less harmful treatments are introduced. That ideology prevents a comprehensive and rational approach to the problems of stress and aging.REFERENCESMed Sci Monit. 2002 Jul;8(7):CR473-7.Effect of renin-angiotensin system activation by dietary sodium restriction and upright position on plasma leptin concentration in patients with essential hypertension.Adamczak M, Kokot F, Chudek J, Wiecek A.Obesity (Silver Spring). 2006 Sep;14(9):1571-8.Associations between aortic calcification and components of body composition in elderly men.Alexandersen P, TankÃ³ LB, Bagger YZ, Jespersen J, Skouby SO, Christiansen C.Am J Physiol Renal Physiol. 2008 Sep;295(3):F619-24.Brain cell volume regulation in hyponatremia: role of sex, age, vasopressin, and hypoxia.Ayus JC, Achinger SG, Arieff A.Neurochem Res 1991 Mar;16(3):269-78.Alterations of GABA metabolism and seizure susceptibility in the substantia nigra of the kindled rat acclimating to changes in osmotic state.Baxter CF, Oh CC, Wasterlain CG, Ozaki LK, Baldwin RA.Diabetes. 2012 Mar;61(3):560-1.Does inhibition of beta-cell proliferation by free fatty acid in mice explain the progressive failure of insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes?Boden G.BJOG. 2004 Sep;111(9):1020-2.Severe hyponatraemia and pre-eclampsia.Burrell C, de Swiet M.Stem Cells. 2010 Sep;28(9):1630-8.Pancreatic Î²-cell neogenesis by direct conversion from mature Î±-cells.Chung CH, Hao E, Piran R, Keinan E, Levine F.Eur Respir J Suppl. 2003 Nov;46:33s-40s.Fluid homeostasis in chronic obstructive lung disease.de Leeuw PW, Dees A.Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2011 Jan;22(1):34-43.Beta-cell regeneration: the pancreatic intrinsic faculty.Desgraz R, Bonal C, Herrera PL.Am J Physiol. 1993 May;264(5 Pt 1):E730-4.Effect of sodium intake on insulin sensitivity.Donovan DS, Solomon CG, Seely EW, Williams GH, Simonson DC.Nat Med.

Blake=======================Kurt Goldstein: \"Life is a condition alternating between excitation, destructionand unbalance, and reorganization, equilibrium and rest.\"===========================Oncological pathologists, looking at slices of a tumor, believe they can guesswhen the cells have an evil intention. However, biologists studying living cells find thatcells can do only what they are allowed to do by their environment.===========================Cancer: Disorder and EnergyAccording to the World Health Organization, cancer is now the leading cause of death inthe world. Although many \"causes\" are known, and despite the \"War on Cancer,\"nothing practical has been done to reduce the incidence of cancer. Since Nixon startedthat war, the number of people dying annually in the US has increased faster than thepopulation. In ancient Rome and Egypt, cancer was rare; cancer has been identified inonly one Egyptian mummy. In the US and several other countries, between 2002 and2005 there was an unprecedented decline (7% in the US) in the incidence of breastcancer, when the medical use of estrogen decreased following the Women's HealthInitiative report showing that estrogen caused cancer, dementia, strokes and heartattacks. However, when the public was reassured about estrogen's safety, breastcancer incidence began increasing again each year.The cancer industry has been flexible and imaginative in ways of presenting \"agestandardized\" death rates to show that they are making progress against cancer, butthere are philosophical and scientific problems in \"oncology\" (i.e., the study or treatmentof lumps) that should be considered by anyone who plans to do business with thatprofession.In the 19th century (in Johannes Muller's lab), cancers, like other animal tissues, werefound to be made up of cells, and by 1858, all diseases were said to be caused bydisturbances in cells (Rudolph Virchow). The atomic and molecular theory of matter wasbecoming accepted at the time that animals were found to be made up of cells, and inboth cases the \"elementary particles\" seemed to have a special power to explain things.This idea of a cellular basis of disease gradually displaced the old idea that diseaseswere caused by an imbalance of the body fluids, or humors. In 1863, Virchowrecognized that inflammation, involving leukocytes, was a common feature of cancer,but that aspect of his work was neglected for a long time.Recent medical textbooks reveal no major change in the understanding of cancer sinceVirchow's time, except that \"genes\" (which weren't known during Virchow's life)gradually became the most important aspect of cells. The typical modern textbookdescribes the cellular disturbance of cancer as the result of an \"initiating\" mutation in agene, which gives it the potential to develop into a cancer, if it subsequently is exposedto a \"promoter,\" which causes it to multiply. In some versions of the theory, a promoter isa second mutation that causes proliferation, but in other versions the promotion iscaused by chemicals binding to receptors the way hormones do, to stimulateproliferation. Typically, textbooks (and reports of continuing research) describesubsequent changes in the genes that cause a cancer to progress from a simple excessof cells through stages of increasing malignancy: hyperplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma insitu, invasive cancer.One of the reasons that the medical understanding of cancer hasn't changedsignificantly since Virchow's time is that blaming misbehaving cells for causing a tumorfits into the older medical tradition, that has existed at least since the time ofHippocrates, 400 BC, which treated tumors either by cutting them out, or by burningthem off with caustics. Virchow's identification of misbehaving cells provided a clearmental image of exactly what the physician must try to destroy. And it's probably hard toget interested in something which could seriously limit your professional activities if itturned out to be true.The \"cellular basis of cancer\" was developed simultaneously with the germ theory ofdisease, and in the case of cancer, the deviant cells came to be considered an aliensubstance, \"not-self,\" analogous to infective germs. Paul Ehrlich's search for poisonsthat were specific for bacterial pathogens was quickly extended to the idea of findingpoisons that would distinguish between cancer cells and the patient's cells.Hippocrates' therapeutic approach to cancer may have survived for 2400 years, but theideas of his younger contemporary, Plato, about order and causation have probably hada greater effect on medicine. Plato believed that the world of experience is inferior andaccidental, and that there are timeless \"Forms\" that are the real substances. In theatomic theory of matter, eternal, unchanging atoms took the place of platonic forms, andthere are still molecular biologists who insist that life can only be explained in terms ofits constituent atoms (\"What else is there but atoms?\"). This philosophy of timelessforms was a deep commitment of people like Gregor Mendel and August Weismann,whose ideas dominated the thinking of early 20th century geneticists. Genes were theimmutable essence of organisms, and the cells, tissues, and organs that form theorganism are merely temporal and accidental. Weismann's \"germ plasm\" or germ linecontained the immortal genes, the rest of the body lacked them, and was essentiallymortal.For most of the 20th century, the official doctrine was that most of the cells of the adultbody became stationary once the body reached its adult size, and that aging consistedof the \"wearing out\" of those mortal cells. When a tumor, containing new cells, wouldappear and grow, these cells were called \"immortal,\" because they didn't follow the rulefor normal, stationary, mortal cells. Their \"immortality\" is often demonstrated by growingthem endlessly in culture dishes. Normal cells, if they can be made to survive in aculture dish, are likely to be \"transformed\" into cancer, demonstrated by their ability toreplicate in dishes.This is an important ideological point, that developed as biologists were experiencingthe extreme difficulty of getting cells to replicate, or even to survive, in culture dishes. Ithas only recently been realized that cells need more than nutritional and hormonalsignals to survive in culture; they require certain textural, structural, even rhythmicallyrepeating conditions that mimic their surroundings in the living body.Applied to cancer, the gene theory made it seem clear that the changes occurring intumor cells were irrevocable, and it has seemed self-evident to oncologists that the onlyhope the cancer patient has is for the physician to destroy every bit of the aliensubstance. The recurrence of a cancer that has been removed has been evidence tothem that fragments had remained, or that the cancer had distributed its seeds intoother parts of the body. This seems to be the necessary conclusion if cancer is \"caused\"by defective genes.New ideas of causality have grown up in science beside, or within, the science culturethat is committed to platonism, reductionism, and genetic determinism. A few biologists,including Ana Soto and Carlos Sonnenschein, are applying more realistic ideas ofcausality to ecological, developmental, and cancer research. They have said (Soto, etal., 2009) \"The ecological developmental biology (eco-devo) movement rejects thenotion that development is merely the unfolding of a genetic program.\" If events such ascancer aren't \"caused by genes,\" understanding the causes of cancer and theappropriate ways to treat it will require more holistic ways of looking at the tumor'srelation to the organism, and the organism's relation to the environment.It has been more than 40 years since experimenters demonstrated that cancer cellscould be caused to revert to normal, by changing their environment. Harry Rubin (2006)has observed that cells can accumulate hundreds of mutations, and still functionnormally in the organism, but when separated and grown in a culture dish theirdifferences become obvious. The surrounding cells in the body are causing thedefective cells to remain normal in appearance, function, and growth behavior, insteadof acting like cancer cells, and can also cause \"stem-like\" cells to differentiateappropriately.. He says \"Intimate contact between the interacting cells is required toinduce these changes.\" When stem cells enter a tumor, they don't find that regulatory,normalizing interaction with normal cells.Work like Rubin's shows that even \"myriad\" mutations don't necessarily cause cancer,and another line of research shows that things which don't cause mutations can causecancer--the \"non-mutagenic carcinogens.\" The presence of mutations is neithersufficient nor necessary for causing cancer, but tumors do eventually accumulateserious damage, which causes most of the tumor cells to die quickly. Biological stress,or excitotoxic energy deprivation, destabilizes the genome; genetic changes develop asa result of prolonged destructive influences. The \"non-genotoxic\" carcinogens firstcause inflammation, excitation, and energy impairment, leading to fibrosis, and atrophy.Cycles of cell injury, death, and repair cause chromosomes to deteriorate as the tissueloses its organization.When a cell is stimulated, it responds, and the response requires energy. The strongerand more continuous the stimulus, the more energy the cell needs to continueresponding. In some conditions, cells can desensitize themselves, to survive in thepresence of continuous stimulation or irritation, but otherwise they are killed when theydon't have enough energy to keep responding.When a nerve is stimulated and responds, a wave of negative electrical charge passesthrough it; the electrical field accompanies a structural change in the cytoplasm of thenerve; similar changes occur in other types of cell. Stimulation of a nerve with negative(cathodal) polarity causes swelling, stimulation with the opposite polarity causes theopposite behavior; when nerve cells are inhibited, they shrink (Tasaki and Byrne,1980; Tasaki, et al., 1988; Tasaki, 1999).Swelling, an increase of the water content of an area of tissue, is a general feature ofinflammation (Weiss, et al., 1951), whether it's in a lump caused by a bee sting, abruise, or hives, or a cancer. Besides the instantaneous uptake of water described byTasaki, there are increases that continue because of metabolic and chemical changes inthe irritated cell. Tasaki has used gels of synthetic polymers to demonstrate that anelectrical field can cause these changes, without the need for the \"chemical osmotic\"changes that are customarily assumed to account for the swelling changes caused bystress (Tasaki, 2002). When the pH of a protein gel becomes more alkaline, it swells.The electrical activation of a nerve causes a quick shift towards internal alkalinity(Endres, et al., 1986), followed by a sudden increase in lactic acid production. Althoughincreased lactic acid causes acidity of an irritated or inflamed region, the conversion ofpyruvic acid to lactic acid causes the interior of the stressed cell to become morealkaline, causing it to swell. This is the same process that causes the familiar swelling oftired muscles.If blood vessels swell, the delivery of oxygen may be restricted, and hypoxia causesmore intense swelling, because more lactic acid is produced, and less oxidized. Thisswelling pressure resembles an increase of osmolarity. For over 100 years, it has beencustomary to treat shock with \"isotonic\" fluids, which are in balance with welloxygenated tissues, with approximately 290 milliosmoles per liter, but this usuallycauses edema, swelling, and weight gain. Stressed tissues have been found to be inbalance with fluids of much higher osmolarity, for example 372 mOsm/L (Tranum-Jensen, et al., 1981), and sometimes much higher.Apart from its acidity, lactic acid acts as an excitatory signal. A very slight increaseabove the normal amount of lactic acid in the body fluids excites sensitive cells, and theamounts reached in inflamed tissues and in cancers will excite even stable cells such asmyelinated nerves (Uchida and Murao, 1975).Cancer cells show all the signs of being intensely stimulated, and this includes a highrate of oxygen consumption (deGroof, et al., 2009). The stimulation increases theenergy requirements beyond the ability of the mitochondria's capacity to meet them,leading to the production of lactate even when a normal amount of oxygen is present.Even when both glucose and oxygen are supplied (which they usually aren't), the tumorcells will consume amino acids as fuel, as well as using them as material for growth.Tumors have been called \"nitrogen traps\" or \"glutamine traps,\" but this has meaningbeyond the use of the nitrogen for growth; it is involved in the energetic inefficiency ofthis process, and the reorganizing effects this wasteful flow of energy has on the tissuestructure (Medina, 2001). When glutamine enters the Krebs cycle to be used as fuel,this interferes with the ability to oxidize glucose, causing more lactic acid to be formed,contributing to the excitation and increased energy requirement.Lactic acid activates the other major mediators of inflammation, including prostaglandins(made from PUFA), free fatty acids (including arachidonate, that formsprostaglandins; Schoonderwoerd, et al., 1989), nitric oxide, carbon monoxide,proteolytic enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix, TNF (Jensen, et al., 1990),hypoxia inducible factor (Lu, et al., 2002; McFate, et al., 2008), interferon, andinterleukins. Arachidonic acid itself can increase lactate production (Meroni, et al.,2003). TNFalpha and interferon gamma activate lactic acid production by increasingprostaglandins (Taylor, et al., 1992).Most of the present information about cancer cells' behavior, such as reactions toradiation and chemical toxins, has been based on the study of cells in culture dishes.For more than 70 years, it was generally believed that radiation caused mutations andcancer by directly modifying the cells' genetic material. Then, it was discovered thatfresh cells that were added to a dish of irradiated cells also developed mutations. Theradiation causes cells to emit excitatory, inflammatory, substances such as serotoninand nitric oxide, which injure the cells that are later put near them.Applying this information to the existing knowledge that radiation induces cancer inanimals, the doctrine of genetic determinism inferred that the radiation \"bystandereffect\" is just another mechanism by which radiation produces the \"mutant cancer cell\"or clone of cancer cells. But the difference between events in vitro and in vivo is thatcells which are injured in the organism immediately initiate a process of healing, and inthat situation each of the substances emitted by injured cells is acting both locally andsystemically to activate repair or regeneration of the damaged tissue. Cells isolated in aculture dish can't call on the organism for the necessary materials, so the responses ofthe \"bystander\" cells, leading to mutations and death, seem meaningless. The injuredcells are merely toxic, rather than potentially being a stimulus to healing.When any part of a living organism is injured, for example by x-rays or surgery, theemitted substances affect the endocrine and nervous systems, activating processes thatchange metabolism and behavior. The injured tissue takes on new functions, forexample by locally synthesizing estrogen, cortisol (Vukelic, et al., 2011), and otherhormones, as well as stimulating the normal endocrine glands to secrete them. Theseinteractions have been generally disregarded in cancer treatment, because of the gene centeredtheory of cancer, but they are essential for understanding the \"malignancy\" oftumors, that property that makes them likely to return after the tumor has beendestroyed, and to spread to other tissues. Has anyone ever heard of a radiologist orsurgeon who measured estrogen or the various mediators of inflammation before,during, and after their treatments? Long range survival after breast cancer surgery isaffected by the time in the menstrual cycle when the surgery is done (Lemon, et al.,1996).All sorts of stress, inflammation, and tissue injury increase the concentration ofestrogen, both locally and systemically. Estrogen in turn produces hypoxia, swelling,lactic acid formation, and stimulates cell multiplication. Even a brief period of hypoxiawill cause the secretion of lactate and other chemoattractants (Neumann, et al., 1993),which will cause cells to move into the hypoxic area from the blood stream. Althoughlactic acid attracts immune cells, it probably reduces their anticancer functions, and itstimulates the formation of new blood vessels, supporting continued growth andexpansion of the multiplying cells (Hirschhaeuer, et al., 2011). When a tissue is beingrepaired normally, the new cells sense a quorum, and stop multiplying. The return ofnerves to the damaged area is part of the regenerative process; nerves have inductiveand stabilizing effects on differentiating cells.These complex interactions between tumor cells and the rest of the organism are notconsidered by the ideology of medical oncologists. The ruling belief is that themalignancy of cells can be determined by examining them microscopically, and thattheir rate of growth can be determined, and that the tumor's approximate time of origincan be estimated. After surgically removing a tumor, the administration of chemotherapyand/or radiation is governed by mathematical descriptions of the expected behavior ofcancer cells.The mathematical relation of mortality to aging was described by Benjamin Gompertz,an actuary, in 1825, based on the understanding that people become less able to resistdying as they get older. This Gompertzian growth curve, which is realistic when appliedto a population of people, flies, or rabbits, was applied to tumor growth (A.K. Laird, in1964). Gompertz' reasoning that the probability of a person's dying increases with agehas nothing to do with cancer cells, and there is very little evidence that his law ofgrowth is useful for describing tumors. Laird's evidence consisted of 19 tumor samples,taken from 10 mice, 8 rats, and a rabbit. Her suggestion that the continuing decelerationof the growth rate might represent a natural growth regulating process wasn't influential,but her use of an actuarial formula, suggesting certain properties of cancer cells, hasbeen extremely influential. It seems to be the profession's great need for justificationthat has made a Law of Tumor Growth so important to them.At the time Laird did the tumor growth study, there was considerable interest in the ideathat the immune system could be induced to prevent tumor growth. In 1951, ChesterSoutham, of the Sloan-Kettering Institute, tested his theory of cancer immunity onhundreds of patients and prisoners, and his results were widely reported. He found thatpieces of tumor implanted in healthy people caused a local intense inflammation, whichhealed completely after two or three weeks. In sick people, the rejection of the cancerimplant took about twice as long, and in people who already had cancer, the implantwas very slow to be destroyed, and sometimes it was still present when they died.In 1889, Stephen Paget had noticed that cancers metastasize only into certain organs,and compared the cancer cells to seeds that \"can only live and grow if they fall oncongenial soil.\" While many people, like Southam, saw a failing \"immune system\" aspart of the congenial soil, and suggested vaccination to activate an immune rejection ofthe tumor, others have suggested \"reducing the soil to dust,\" making growth impossiblein a more general way. Recently, this attitude has taken the form of different ways of\"starving\" cancer, by reducing sugar in the diet, or by blocking cells' ability to use sugar.The idea of making the \"soil\" inhospitable to cancer is a variation on the theme of killingthe unwanted tissue.As long as the lump is defined as an alien material, killing it by any means seemsreasonable, but if it is seen as the body's attempt to repair itself, then killing it is no morereasonable than it would be to cut the spots out of someone with smallpox.When a cell is dying, it emits growth stimulating signals (Huang, et al., 2011). That's anormal part of tissue renewal. Some of its substance guides the differentiation of newcells, as demonstrated long ago by Polezhaev (discussed in my previous article, \"Stemcells, cell culture, and culture: Issues in regeneration\"). Anything that injures a tissueenough to require cells to be replaced causes the activation of a regulatory protein,hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF, which inhibits mitochondrial respiration, causing a shifttoward glycolytic metabolism, increasing substances needed for growth. HIF is essentialto the healing of any wound. Even glucose deprivation can cause the induction of HIF.Prostaglandins, made from polyunsaturated fatty acids released by stimulation, cancause HIF to increase, but HIF also causes prostaglandins to increase. Lactic acidincreases the expression of HIF, while HIF causes cells to shift metabolically to dependon converting glucose to lactic acid, that is, to adopt the \"cancer metabolism.\" HIF isrecognized as a fundamental problem in \"cancer therapy,\" since HIF allows the cancerto resist the treatment, but the treatment increases HIF.Radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery all activate these processes of cell replacement,and unless something has changed to improve the organism's recuperative ability, itisn't clear why the cells which replace the missing part should be more able tosatisfactorily complete the recovery process than the original cells were. Even theamount of radiation in a single dental x-ray is enough to activate the excitatory-inflammatoryprocesses, and a \"therapeutic\" x-ray to any part of the body excites similar, but much greater, processes throughout the body. But the ideology of \"the cancer cell,\" and the Gompertz Growth Law, guide the practice of cancer treatment.Many years ago, Harry Rubin was impressed by hearing from a pathologist that he hadbeen able to find diagnosable cancer somewhere in the body of every person over theage of 50 that he had autopsied. If everyone has cancer by the age of 50, that meansthat cancer is harmless for most people, and that small cancers might frequentlyappear, and be spontaneously removed as part of the body's regular house-cleaning.One of the reasons that spontaneous regression of tumors seems so rare isundoubtedly that most tumors are quickly cut out by surgeons.Preventing injury should be a basic consideration, but the medical slogan, \"first do noharm,\" just doesn't apply to the cancer treatment industry, and this results from thedoctrine of \"the cancer cell,\" which is something to be destroyed or kept frommultiplying. In the process of diagnosing a cancer, and during the course of treating it,the patient is usually subjected to multiple x-ray examinations, sometimes givenradioactive drugs that supposedly concentrate in hidden tumors to emit positrons, andoften has toxic contrast agents injected even for MRI examinations. These procedures,even before the destructive \"therapies\" begin, are adding to the body's inflammatoryburden, interfering with the body's ability to complete a healing process. Decisionsabout pain control usually disregard the effects of the drugs on tumor growth andgeneral vitality--for example, the opiates stimulate histamine release, which increasesinflammation and tumor growth.In 1927, Bernstein and Elias found that rats eating a fat free diet had almost nospontaneous cancer, and many studies since then in animals and people have shown aclose association between polyunsaturated fatty acids and cancer. The polyunsaturatedfatty acids in themselves, and their breakdown products, are excitatory and destabilizingto normal cells, but by modifying the sensitivity and energy production of cells, they limitcells' ability to respond to stimulation and destabilizing influences. Although they aren'tessential for wound healing (Porras-Reyes, et al., 1992), they and their metabolites, theprostaglandins, are very conspicuous in wounds and tumors, and their proportiongenerally increases with aging. The prostaglandins are involved in several viciouscycles, including that with HIF mentioned above. This makes the PUFA andprostaglandins important to consider in relation to optimizing wound healing, anddecreasing cancerization. Aspirin's protective and therapeutic effects in cancer arestarting to be recognized, but there are several other things that can synergize withaspirin to reduce the circulation of free fatty acids and their conversion toprostaglandins. Niacinamide, progesterone, sugar, carbon dioxide, and red light protectagainst both free fatty acids and prostaglandins.Since excitation leads to intracellular alkalinity and swelling, reducing the excitationseems reasonable, and many things which protect cells against excitation also havedemonstrated anticancer effects. Local anesthetics, antihistamines, and antiinflammatorysubstances and some anesthetics such as xenon (Weigt, et al., 2009) are safe. Inhibitory substances related to GABA are being investigated for their ability to stop tumor growth. Simply stopping excessive excitation tends to restore the dominance of oxidative respiration over glycolysis.To restore the supply of oxygen, sugar, and nutrients, swelling must be stopped.Hyperosmotic fluids act directly on swollen cells, removing water. Stopping excitationallows a return to efficient metabolism and reduces the injury potential, allowing the pHto decrease; with lower pH, the cell releases some of its water.Increasing carbon dioxide lowers the intracellular pH, as well as inhibiting lactic acidformation, and restoring the oxidation of glucose increases CO2. Inhibiting carbonicanhydrase, to allow more CO2 to stay in the cell, contributes to intracellular acidification,and by systemically increasing carbon dioxide this inhibition has a broad range ofprotective anti-excitatory effects. The drug industry is now looking for chemicals that willspecifically inhibit the carbonic anhydrase enzymes that are active in tumors. Existingcarbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, will inhibit those enzymes,without harming other tissues. Aspirin has some effect as an inhibitor of carbonicanhydrase (Bayram, et al., 2008). Since histamine, serotonin (Vullo, et al., 2007), andestrogen (Barnett, et al., 2008; Garg, 1975) are carbonic anhydrase activators, theirantagonists would help to acidify the hypoxic cells. Testosterone (Suzuki, et al., 1996)and progesterone are estrogen antagonists that inhibit carbonic anhydrase.With aging, cells have less ability to produce energy, and are often more easilystimulated. The accumulation of polyunsaturated fats is one of the factors that reducethe ability of mitochondria to produce energy (Zhang, et al., 2006, 2009; Yazbeck, et al.,1989). Increased estrogen exposure, decreased thyroid hormone, an increased ratio ofiron to copper, and lack of light, are other factors that impair the cytochrome oxidaseenzyme.The increased intracellular alkalinity and intracellular calcium that result from thecombination of those factors increase the tendency of cells to be overstimulated,leading to aerobic glycolysis, the cancer metabolism. Improving any part of the systemtends to increase carbon dioxide and decrease lactate, permitting differentiatedfunctioning.There are many people currently recommending fish oil (or other highly unsaturatedoils) for preventing or treating cancer, and it has become almost as common torecommend a sugar free diet, \"because sugar feeds cancer.\" This is often, incorrectly,said to be the meaning of Warburg's demonstration that cancer cells have a respiratorydefect that causes them to produce lactic acid from glucose even in the presence ofoxygen. Cancer cells use glucose and the amino acid glutamine primarily for syntheticpurposes, and use fats as their energy source;the growth stimulating effect of the\"essential fatty acids\" (Sueyoshi and Nagao, 1962a; Holley, et al., 1974) shows thatdepriving a tumor of those fats retards its growth. The great energetic inefficiency of thecancer metabolism, which causes it to produce a large amount of heat and to causesystemic stress, failure of immunity, and weight loss, is because it synthesizes fat fromglucose and amino acids, and then oxidizes the fat as if it were diabetic.Estrogen, which is responsible for the fact that women burn fatty acids more easily thanmen, is centrally involved in this metabolic inefficiency. When a tissue is exposed toestrogen, within minutes it takes up water, and begins to synthesize fat, with a tendencyto produce lactic acid at the same time. The alkalizing effect of lactic acid production isapparently what accounts for the uptake of water. Since it takes longer, at least 30minutes, to produce a significant amount of new enzymes, these early changes areexplained by the activation of existing enzymes by estrogen.The transhydrogenases, or the transhydrogenase function of the steroiddehydrogenases, which shift metabolic energy between glycolytic and oxidativesystems, have been shown to explain these effects of estrogen, but thetranshydrogenases can be activated by many stressors. The biological function of thetranshydrogenases seems to be to allow cells to continue growth and repair processesin a hypoxic environment. Estrogen can start the process by creating new pathways forelectrons, and will promote processes that are started by something else, andprogesterone is estrogen's natural antagonist, terminating the process.Recently, a group at Johns Hopkins University (Le, et al., 2012) has been working outthe implications of this ability to change the metabolism under hypoxia: Using anisotope-labeled amino acid, \". . . glutamine import and metabolism through the TCAcycle persisted under hypoxia, and glutamine contributed significantly to citratecarbons. Under glucose deprivation, glutamine-derived fumarate, malate, andcitrate were significantly increased.\" The implication of this is that if the tumor isn'tsupplied with sugar, it will increase the rate at which it consumes the host's proteins.Forty years ago the work of Shapot and Blinov was showing the same effect, exceptthat they demonstrated the involvement of the whole organism, especially the liver, ininteraction with the tumor (Blinov and Shapot, 1975).The alkaline cancer cell surrounds itself by the acid that it emits, and this extracellularacidity increases the ability of fatty acids to enter the cell (Spector, 1969); cancer cells,although they are synthesizing fat, also avidly take it up from their environment(Sueyoshi and Nagao, 1962b). This fat avidity is so extreme that cancer cells in vitro willeat enough polyunsaturated fat to kill themselves. This has been offered as proof thatfish oil kills cancer. Saturated fats, however, have a calming effect on cancer cells,inhibiting their aerobic glycolysis (Marchut, et al., 1986) while permitting them to resumethe respiratory production of energy.The foods that nourish the patient well enough to support healing while permittingenergy reserves to be built up are also the foods that don't interfere with the hormones,that don't cause spurious excitation of the tissues. The polyunsaturated fats directlystimulate the stress hormones, activate the excitatory amino acid signals, and directlyexcite cells, while the saturated fats have opposite effects, and are anti-inflammatory,and also don't interfere with mitochondrial function. When we eat more carbohydratethan can be oxidized, some of it will be turned into saturated fats and omega-9 fats, andthese will support mitochondrial energy production. Carbohydrates in the diet also helpto decrease the mobilization of fatty acids from storage; niacinamide and aspirin supportthat effect. Sugars are probably more favorable than starches for the immune system(Harris, et al., 1999), and failure of the immune system is a common feature of cancer.Polyunsaturated fats are generally known to suppress the immune system. Foods thatprovide generous amounts of sodium, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, help tominimize stress. Trace minerals and vitamins are important, but can be harmful if usedexcessively--iron excess is important to avoid.Emodin, an anti-inflammatory substance found in cascara sagrada bark and otherplants, is similar to other molecules that have been used for treating cancer, and one ofits effects is to lower HIF: \"Consistently, emodin attenuated the expression ofcyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), VEGF, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1!), MMP-1and MMP-13 at mRNA level in IL-1\"and LPS-treated synoviocytes under hypoxia\" (Ha,et al., 2011). MMP-1 and MMP-13 are collagenase enzymes involved in metastasis.When cells are fully nourished, supplied with protective hormones, and properlyilluminated, their ability to communicate should be able to govern their movements,preventing--and possibly reversing--metastatic migration.REFERENCESCancer Res. 2008 May 1;68(9):3505-15.

        "chunk_html": "Fats, functions & malfunctionsSaturated fatty acids terminate the stress reactions, polyunsaturated fatty acids amplify them.The most highly unsaturated fats, including DHA, accumulate with aging, and their toxic fragments are increased in Alzheimer's disease.The most highly unsaturated fats found in fish oil break down into chemicals that block the use of glucose and oxygen.The ratio of saturated fatty acids to polyunsaturated fatty acids is decreased in cancer. Omega-3 fats promote metastasis.Around the beginning of the 20th century, it was commonly believed that aging resulted from the accumulation of insoluble metabolic by-products, sort of like the clinker ash in a coal furnace. Later, age pigment or lipofuscin, was proposed to be such a material. It is a brown pigment that generally increases with age, and its formation is increased by consumption of unsaturated fats, by vitamin E deficiency, by stress, and by exposure to excess estrogen. Although the pigment can contribute to the degenerative processes, aging involves much more than the accumulation of insoluble debris; aging increases the tendency to form the debris, as well as vice versa.There is a growing recognition that a persistent increase of free fatty acids in the serum, which is seen in shock, heart failure, and aging, indicates a bad prognosis, but there is no generally recognized explanation for the fact that free fatty acids are harmful. I want to mention some evidence showing that it is the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats in the body that makes them harmful.The physical and functional properties of saturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are as different from each other as day is from night. The different fatty acids are directly involved, very often with opposite effects, in cell division and growth, cell stability and dissolution, the organization of cells, tissues, and organs, the regulation of pituitary hormones, adrenalin and sympathetic nervous activation, histamine and serotonin synthesis, adrenal cortex hormones, thyroid hormones, testosterone, estrogen, activators of the immune system and inflammation (cytokines), autoimmune diseases, detoxification, obesity, diabetes, puberty, epilepsy,Parkinson's disease, other degenerative nerve diseases and Alzheimer's disease, cancer, heart failure, atherosclerosis, and strokes. In each of these situations, the PUFA have harmful effects.Most people are surprised to hear about the systematically harmful effects of the common dietary polyunsaturated fats and the protective effects of saturated fats. That's because there is a pervasive mythology of fats in our culture. Officials are proposing to tax saturated fats. Laws are being passed prescribing the fats that can be served in restaurants, and people write letters to editors about them, and great amounts of money are spent publicizing the importance of eating the right fats. Their focus is on obesity, atherosclerosis, and heart disease. The details of the myth change a little, as new fat products and industries appear.As I understand the basic myth, the difference between the \"essential\" polyunsaturated fats and the saturated fats has to do with their shape---the unsaturated fatty acids bend or fold in a way that makes them more mobile than saturated fats of the same length, and this causes the all-important \"membranes\" of cells to be more fluid, and thus to have \"better functions,\" though the myth isn't very clear on the issue of fluidity and functionality. At that point, it passes responsibility to the more fundamental biological myth, of the metabolically active cell membrane.Practically everyone learns, in grade school and from television, about the good and the bad oils, and cell membranes, but it might seem likely that people who spend their lives investigating the role of fats in organisms would have acquired a different, more complicated, view. But one of the most famous food fat researchers, J.M. Bourre, has succinctly (and thoughtlessly) expressed his understanding of the function of fatty substances in the body: \"In fact the brain, after adipose tissue, is the organ richest in lipids, whose only role is to participate in membrane structure.\" (J.M. Bourre, 2004.) The fact that his editor let him publish the statement shows how the myth functions, causing people to accept things because they are \"common knowledge.\" The influence of the medical and pharmaceutical industries is so pervasive that it becomes the context for most biological research.Luckily, many people are working outside the myth, in specialized problems of physiology and cell biology, and their observations are showing a reality much more complex and interesting than the mythology.When we eat more protein or carbohydrate than we need, the excess can be converted to fats, to be stored (as triglycerides), but even on a maintenance diet we synthesize some fats that are essential parts of all of our cells, including a great variety of phospholipids. People seldom talk about the importance of fats in the nucleus of the cell, but every nucleus contains a variety of lipids--phospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol, even triglycerides--similar to those that are found elsewhere in the cell and in every part of the body, including the brain (Balint and Holczinger, 1978; Irvine, 2002). Phospholipids are often considered to be \"membrane lipids,\" but they have been demonstrated in association with elements of the cell's skeleton, involved in cell division, rather than in membranes (Shogomori, et al., 1993).The cytoskeleton, a fibrous framework of the cell that's responsible for maintaining the organized structure of the cell, internal movement of organelles, coordination, locomotion, and cell division, is made up of three main kinds of protein, and all of these are affected differently by different kinds of fat.Actions of lipids on the cell skeleton can change cells' movements, migrations, and invasiveness. Unsaturated fats cause clumping of some types of cell filament, condensation and polymerization of other types, in ways that are associated with brain degenerative diseases and cancer. For example, DHA alters the structure of the protein alpha-synuclein, causing it to take the form seen in Parkinson's disease and other brain conditions. The synucleins regulate various structural proteins, and are affected by stress, aging, and estrogen exposure, as well as by the polyunsaturated fats. One type of synuclein is involved in the promotion of breast cancer. Saturated fatty acids have exactly the opposite effects of PUFA on the synucleins, reversing the polymerization caused by the PUFA (Sharon, et al., 2003).When cancers are metastasizing, their phospholipids contain less stearic acid than the less malignant tumors (Bougnoux, et al., 1992), patients with advanced cancer had less stearic acid in their red blood cells (Persad, et al., 1990), and adding stearic acid to their food delayed the development of cancer in mice (Bennett, 1984). The degree of saturation of the body's fatty acids corresponds to resistance to several types of cancer that have been studied (Hawley and Gordon, 1976; Singh, et al., 1995).The phospholipids are being discussed in relation to drugs that can modify \"signaling\" by acting on phospholipid receptors, using language that was developed in relation to hormones. A surface barrier membrane, with receptors that send signals to the nucleus, is invoked by many of the recent discussions of phospholipids. There's no question that the fats do affect regulatory processes, but the theory and the language should correspond to the physiological and ecological realities. Vernadski's metaphor, that an organism is a \"whirlwind of atoms,\" is probably more appropriate than \"targeted signals and receptors\" for understanding the physiology of fatty acids and phospholipids. The rate of change and renewal of these structural fats is very high. In rats, one study found a 30% decrease in the total phospholipid pool in the brain in the first 30 minutes after death (Adineh, et al., 2004).  Another study in the brains of living rats found that a particular class of brain lipids, ethanolamine plasmalogens, had a turnover time of about 5 hours (Masuzawa, et al., 1984). (This type of lipid is an important component of the lipoproteins secreted by the liver into the serum [Vance, 1990], and is also a major lipid in the heart and brain.)  Stresses such as the loss of sleep cause great distortions in phospholipid metabolism throughout the body, especially in the brain and liver.Actions of lipids on the cell skeleton can change cells' movements, migrations, and invasiveness, even in short term experiments. The effects of the \"essential fatty acid\" linoleic acid have been compared to the drug colchicine, which is known to interfere with the cell skeleton and cell division. According to Hoover, et al., (1981), it disturbed the structure of the cytoskeleton more than colchicine does; it caused the cell filaments to clump together, while saturated fatty acids didn't have such an effect.The fatty molecules that participate in the normal cell functions are made by cells even when they are grown in a fat-free solution in a culture dish. They include saturated fatty acids such as palmitate and stearate, and omega-9 unsaturated fats, such as oleic acid and omega-9 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The saturated fatty acids found in the nucleus associated with the chromosomes are resistant to change when the composition of the animal's diet changes (Awad and Spector, 1976), while the unsaturated fats change according to the diet. These intracellular fats are essential for cell division and the regulation of the genes, and for cell survival (Irvine, 2002). Although cells make the saturated fats that participate in those basic functions, the high rate of metabolism means that some of the lipids will quickly reflect in their structure the free fatty acids that circulate in the blood. The fats in the blood reflect the individual's diet history, but recently eaten fats can appear in the serum as free fatty acids, if the liver isn't able to convert them into triglycerides.The polyunsaturated fatty acids differ from the saturated fats in many ways, besides their shape and their melting temperature, and each type of fatty acid is unique in its combination of properties. The polyunsaturated fatty acids, made by plants (in the case of fish oils, they are made by algae), are less stable than the saturated fats, and the omega-3 and omega-6 fats derived from them, are very susceptible to breaking down into toxins, especially in warm-blooded animals. Other differences between saturated and polyunsaturated fats are in their effects on surfaces (as surfactant), charges (dielectric effects), acidity, and their solubility in water relative to their solubility in oil. The polyunsaturated fatty acids are many times more water soluble than saturated fatty acids of the same length. This property probably explains why only palmitic acid functions as a surfactant in the lungs, allowing the air sacs to stay open, while unsaturated fats cause lung edema and respiratory failure.The great difference in water/oil solubility affects the strength of binding between a fatty acid and the lipophilic, oil-like, parts of proteins. When a protein has a region with a high affinity for lipids that contain double bonds, polyunsaturated fatty acids will displace saturated fats, and they can sometimes displace hormones containing multiple double bonds, such as thyroxine and estrogen, from the proteins that have a high specificity for those hormones. Transthyretin (also called prealbumin) is important as a carrier of the thyroid hormone and vitamin A. The unsaturation of vitamin A and of thyroxin allow them to bind firmly with transthyretin and certain other proteins, but the unsaturated fatty acids are able to displace them, with an efficiency that increases with the number of double bonds, from linoleic (with two double bonds) through DHA (with six double bonds).The large amount of albumin in the blood is important in normal fatty acid binding and transport, but it is also an important part of our detoxifying system, since it can carry absorbed toxins from the intestine, lungs, or skin to the liver, for detoxification. Albumin facilitates the uptake of saturated fatty acids by cells of various types (Paris, et al., 1978), and its ability to bind fatty acids can protect cells to some extent from the unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., Rhoads, et al., 1983). The liver's detoxification system processes some polyunsaturated fats for excretion, along with hormones and environmental toxins.The movement of proteins from the plasma into cells has often been denied, but there is clear evidence that a variety of proteins, including IgG, transferrin haptoglobin, and albumin can be found in a variety of cells, even in the brain (Liu, et al., 1989). Cells are lipophilic, and absorb molecules in proportion to their fattiness; this long ago led people to theorize that cells are coated with a fat membrane.The idea of a semipermeable membrane, similar in function to the membrane inside an egg shell, was proposed about 150 years ago, to explain the ability of living cells to concentrate certain chemicals, such as potassium ions, while excluding others, such as sodium ions. This idea of a molecular sieve was shown to be invalid when radioactive isotopes made it possible to observe that sodium ions diffuse freely into cells, and it was replaced by the idea of a metabolically active membrane, containing \"pumps\" that made up for the inability to exclude various things, and that allowed cells to retain high concentrations of some dissolved substances that are free to diffuse out of the cell. The general idea of the membrane as a barrier persisted as a sort of \"common sense\" idea, that has made people ignore experiments that show that some large molecules, including some proteins, can quickly and massively enter cells. Albumin and transthyretin are two proteins that are sometimes found in large quantities inside cells, and their primary importance is that they bind and transport biologically active oily molecules.While the competition by PUFA for protein binding sites blocks the effects of thyroid hormone and vitamin A, the action of PUFA on the sex steroid binding protein (SBP, or SSBG, for sex steroid binding globulin) increases the activity of estrogen. That's because the SSBG neutralizes estrogen by binding it, keeping it out of cells; free PUFA keep it from binding estrogen (Reed, et al., 1986). People with low SSBG/estrogen ratio have an increased risk of cancer. When the SSBG protein is free of estrogen, it is able to enter cells, and in that estrogen-free state it probably serves a similar protective function, capturing estrogen molecules that enter cells before they can act on other proteins or chromosomes. Transthyretin, the main transporter of thyroid and vitamin A, and albumin (which can also transport thyroid hormone) are both able to enter cells, while loaded with thyroid hormone and vitamin A. Albumin becomes more lipophilic as it binds more lipid molecules, so its tendency to enter cells increases in proportion to its fat burden. Albumin in the urine is a problem associated with diabetes and kidney disease; albumin loaded with fatty acids passes from the blood into the urine more easily than unloaded albumin, and it is the fatty acids, not the albumin, which causes the kidney damage (Kamijo, et al., 2002). It's possible that SSBG's opposite behavior, entering cells only when it carries no hormones, is the result of becoming less lipophilic when it's loaded with estrogen.Since most people believe that cells are enclosed within a barrier membrane, a new industry has appeared to sell special products to \"target\" or \"deliver\" proteins into cells across the barrier. Combining anything with fat makes it more likely to enter cells. Stress (which increases free fatty acids and lowers cell energy) makes cells more permeable, admitting a broader range of substances, including those that are less lipophilic.Linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, which are said to \"make the lipid membrane more permeable,\" in fact make the whole cell more permeable, by binding to the structural proteins throughout the cell, increasing their affinity for water, causing generalized swelling, as well as mitochondrial swelling (leading to reduced oxidative function or disintegration), allowing more calcium to enter the cell, activating excitatory processes, stimulating a redox shift away from oxidation and toward inflammation, leading to either (inappropriate) growth or death of the cell.When we don't eat for many hours, our glycogen stores decrease, and adrenaline secretion is increased, liberating more glucose as long as glycogen is available, but also liberating fatty acids from the fatty tissues. When the diet has chronically contained more polyunsaturated fats than can be oxidized immediately or detoxified by the liver, the fat stores will contain a disproportionate amount of them, since fat cells preferentially oxidize saturated fats for their own energy, and the greater water solubility of the PUFA causes them to be preferentially released into the bloodstream during stress.In good health, especially in children, the stress hormones are produced only in the amount needed, because of negative feedback from the free saturated fatty acids, which inhibit the production of adrenalin and adrenal steroids, and eating protein and carbohydrate will quickly end the stress. But when the fat stores contain mainly PUFA, the free fatty acids in the serum will be mostly linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, and smaller amounts of other unsaturated fatty acids. These PUFA stimulate the stress hormones, ACTH, cortisol, adrenaline, glucagon, and prolactin, which increase lipolysis, producing more fatty acids in a vicious circle. In the relative absence of PUFA, the stress reaction is self limiting, but under the influence of PUFA, the stress response becomes self-amplifying.When stress is very intense, as in trauma or sepsis, the reaction of liberating fatty acids can become dangerously counter-productive, producing the state of shock. In shock, the liberation of free fatty acids interferes with the use of glucose for energy and causes cells to take up water and calcium (depleting blood volume and reducing circulation) and to leak ATP, enzymes, and other cell contents (Boudreault and Grygorczyk, 2008; Wolfe, et al., 1983; Selzner, et al, 2004; van der Wijk, 2003), in something like a systemic inflammatory state (Fabiano, et al., 2008) often leading to death.The remarkable resistance of \"essential fatty acid deficient\" animals to shock (Cook, et al., 1981; Li et al., 1990; Autore, et al., 1994) shows that the polyunsaturated fats are centrally involved in the maladaptive reactions of shock. The cellular changes that occur in shock--calcium retention, leakiness, reduced energy production--are seen in aging and the degenerative diseases; the stress hormones and free fatty acids tend to be chronically higher in old age, and an outstanding feature of old age is the reduced ability to tolerate stress and to recover from injuries.Despite the instability of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which tend to break down into toxic fragments, and despite their tendency to be preferentially liberated from fat cells during stress, the proportion of them in many tissues increases with age (Laganiere and Yu, 1993, 1987; Lee, et al., 1999; Smidova, et al., 1990;Tamburini, et al., 2004; Nourooz-Zadeh J and Pereira, 1999 ). This progressive increase with age can be seen already in early childhood (Guerra, et al., 2007). The reason for this increase seems to be that the saturated fatty acids are preferentially oxidized by many types of cell, (fat cells can slowly oxidize fat for their own energy maintenance). Albumin preferentially delivers saturated fatty acids into actively metabolizing cells such at the heart (Paris, 1978) for use as fuel. This preferential oxidation would explain Hans Selye's results, in which canola oil in the diet caused the death of heart cells, but when the animals received stearic acid in addition to the canola oil, their hearts showed no sign of damage.Since healthy cells are very lipophilic, saturated fatty acids would have a greater tendency to enter them than the more water soluble polyunsaturated fats, especially those with 4, 5, or 6 double bonds, but as cells become chronically stressed they more easily admit the unsaturated fats, which slow oxidative metabolism and create free radical damage. The free radicals are an effect of stress and aging, as well as a factor in its progression.When stress signals activate enzymes in fat cells to release free fatty acids from the stored triglycerides, the enzymes in the cytoplasm act on the surface of the droplet of fat. This means that the fatty acids with the greatest water solubility will be liberated from the fat to move into the blood stream, while the more oil soluble fatty acids will remain in the droplet. The long chain of saturated carbon atoms (8 in the case of oleic acid, 15 in palmitic acid, and 17 in stearic acid) in the \"tail\" of oleic, palmitic, and stearic acid will be buried in the fat droplet, while the tail of the n-3 fatty acids, with only 2 saturated carbons, will be the most exposed to the lipolytic enzymes. This means that the n-3 fatty acids are the first to be liberated during stress, the n-6 fatty acids next. Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids are selectively retained by fat cells (Speake, et al., 1997).Women are known to have a greater susceptibility than men to lipolysis, with higher levels of free fatty acids in the serum and liver, because of the effects of estrogen and related hormones.Women on average have more DHA circulating in the serum than men (Giltay, et al., 2004; McNamara, et al., 2008; Childs, et al., 2008). This highly unsaturated fatty acid is the first to be liberated from the fat stores under stress, and, biologically, the meaning of estrogen is to mimic stress. Estrogen and polyunsaturated fatty acids have similar actions on cells, increasing their water content and calcium uptake. Long before the Women's Health Initiative reported in 2002 that the use of estrogen increased the risk of dementia, it was known that the incidence of Alzhemer's disease was 2 or 3 times higher in women than in men. Men with Alzheimer's disease have higher levels of estrogen than normal men (Geerlings, et al., 2006). The amount of DHA in the brain (and other tissues) increases with aging, and its breakdown products, including neuroprostanes, are associated with dementia. Higher levels of DHA and total PUFA are found in the plasma of demented patients (Laurin, et al., 2003).Another interesting association of the highly unsaturated fats and estrogen in relation to brain function is that DHA increases the entry of estrogen into the pregnant uterus, but inhibits the entry of progesterone (Benassayag, et al., 1999), which is crucial for brain cell growth. When Dirix, et al., (2009) supplemented pregnant women with PUFA, they found that fetal memory was impaired.The crucial mitochondrial respiratory enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, declines with aging (Paradies, et al., 1997), as the lipid cardiolipin declines, and the enzyme's activity can be restored to the level of young animals by adding cardiolipin. The composition of cardiolipin changes with aging, \"specifically an increase in highly unsaturated fatty acids\" (Lee, et al., 2006). Other lipids, such as a phosphatidylcholine containing two myristic acid groups, can support the enzyme's activity (Hoch, 1992). Even supplementing old animals with hydrogenated peanut oil restores mitochondrial respiration to about 80% of normal (Bronnikov, et al., 2010).Supplementing thyroid hormone increases mitochondrial cardiolipin (Paradies and Ruggiero, 1988). Eliminating the polyunsaturated fats from the diet increases mitochondrial respiration (Rafael, et al., 1984).Excitotoxicity is the process in which activation of a nerve cell beyond its capacity to produce energy injures or kills the cell, by increasing intracellular calcium. Glutamic acid and aspartic acid are the normal neurotransmitter excitatory amino acids. Estrogen increases the activity of the excitatory transmitter glutamate (Weiland, 1992), and glutamate increases the release of free fatty acids (Kolko, et al., 1996). DHA (more strongly even than arachidonic acid) inhibits the uptake of the excitotoxic amino acid aspartate, and in some situations glutamate, prolonging their actions. Thymocytes are much more easily killed by stress than nerve cells, and they are easy to study. The PUFA kill them by increasing their intracellular calcium. The toxicity of DHA is greater than that of EPA, whose toxicity is greater than alpha-linolenic acid, and linoleic acid was the most potent (Prasad, et al., 2010). Excitotoxicity is probably an important factor in Alzheimer's disease (Danysz and Parsons, 2003).When the brain is injured, DHA and arachidonic acid contribute to brain edema, weakening the blood-brain-barrier, increasing protein breakdown, inflammation, and peroxidation, while a similar amount of stearic acid in the same situation caused no harm (Yang, et al., 2007). In other situations, such as the important intestinal barrier, EPA and DHA also greatly increased the permeability (Dombrowsky, et al., 2011).The process by which excitotoxicity kills a cell is probably a foreshortened version of the aging process.Excitotoxins (including endotoxin) increase the formation of neuroprostanes and isoprostanes (from n-3 and n-6 PUFA) (Milatovic, et al., 2005), and acrolein and other fragments, which inhibit the use of glucose and oxygen.  DHA and EPA produce acrolein and HHE, which react with lysine groups in proteins, and modify nucleic acids, changing the bases in DNA.Increased intracellular calcium activates lipolysis (by phospholipases), producing more free fatty acids, as well as excitation and protein breakdown, and in the brain neurodegenerative diseases, calcium excess contributes to the clumping of synuclein (Wojda, et al., 2008), an important regulator of the cytoskeletal proteins. The reduced function of normal synuclein makes cells more susceptible to excitotoxicity (Leng and Chuang, 2006).If the cells adapt to the increased calcium, rather than dying, their sensitivity is reduced. This is probably involved in the \"defensive inhibition\" seen in many types of cell. In the brain, DHA and arachidonic acid \"brought the cells to a new steady state of a moderately elevated [intracellular calcium] level, where the cells became virtually insensitive to external stimuli. This new steady state can be considered as a mechanism of self-protection\" (Sergeeva, et al., 2005). In the heart, the PUFAs decreased the sensitivity to stimulation (Coronel et al., 2007) and conduction velocity (Tselentakis, et al., 2006; Dhein, et al., 2005). Both DHA and EPA inhibit calcium-ATPase (which keeps intracellular calcium low to allow normal neurotransmission) in the cerebral cortex; this suggests \"a mechanism that explains the dampening effect of omega-3 fatty acids on neuronal activity\" (Kearns and Haag, 2002).In normal aging, most processes are slowed, including nerve conduction velocity, and conduction velocity in the heart (Dhein and Hammerath, 2001). A similar \"dampening\" or desensitization is seen in sensory, endocrine, and immune systems, as well as in energy metabolism. Calorie restriction, by decreasing the age-related accumulation of PUFA (20:4, 22:4, and 22:5), can prevent the decrease of sensitivity, for example in lymphoid cells (Laganier and Fernandes, 1991). The known effects of the unsaturated fats on the organizational framework of the cell are consistent with the changes that occur in aging.One of the essential protective functions that decline with aging is the liver's ability to detoxify chemicals, by combining them with glucuronic acid, making them water soluble so that they can be excreted in the urine. The liver (and also the intestine and stomach) efficiently process DHA by glucuronidation (Little, et al., 2002). Oleic acid, one of the fats that we synthesize ourselves, increases (about 8-fold) the activity of the glucuronidation process (Krcmery and Zakim, 1993; Okamura, et al., 2006). However, this system is inhibited by the PUFA, arachidonic acid (Yamashita, et al., 1997), and also by linoleic acid (Tsoutsikos, et al., 2004), in one of the processes that contribute to the accumulation of PUFA with aging.Animals that naturally have a relatively low level of the highly unsaturated fats in their tissues have the greatest longevity. For example, the naked mole rate has a life expectancy of more than 28 years, about 9 times as long as other rodents of a similar size. Only about 2% to 6% of its phospholipids contain DHA, while about 27% to 57% of the phospholipids of mice contain DHA Mitchell, et al., 2007).The famously long-lived people of Azerbaijan eat a diet containing a low ratio of unsaturated to saturated fats, emphasizing fruits, vegetables, and dairy products (Grigorov, et al., 1991).Some of the clearest evidence of the protective effects of saturated fats has been published by A.A. Nanji's group, showing that they can reverse the inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis of alcoholic liver disease, even with continued alcohol consumption, while fish oil and other unsaturated fats exacerbate the problem (Nanji, et al., 2001). Glycine protects against fat accumulation in alcohol-induced liver injury (Senthilkumar, et al., 2003), suggesting that dietary gelatin would complement the protective effects of saturated fats.The least stable n-3 fats which accumulate with age and gradually reduce energy production also have their short term effects on endurance. Endurance was much lower in rats fed a high n-3 fat diet, and the effect persisted even after 6 weeks on a standard diet (Ayre and Hulbert, 1997). Analogous, but less extreme effects are seen even in salmon, which showed increased oxidative stress on a high n-3 diet (DHA or EPA), and lower mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase activity (Kjaer, et al., 2008).Maintaining a high rate of oxidative metabolism, without calorie restriction, retards the accumulation of PUFA, and a high metabolic rate is associated with longevity. An adequate amount of sugar maintains both a high rate of metabolism, and a high respiratory quotient, i.e., high production of carbon dioxide. Mole rats, bats, and queen bees, with an unusually great longevity, are chronically exposed to high levels of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide forms carbamino bonds with the amino groups of proteins, inhibiting their reaction with the reactive \"glycating\" fragments of PUFA.To minimize the accumulation of the highly unsaturated fatty acids with aging, it's probably reasonable to reduce the amount of them directly consumed in foods, such as fish, but since they are made in our own tissues from the \"essential fatty acids,\" linoleic and linolenic acids, it's more important to minimize the consumption of those (from plants, pork, and poultry, for example).In the resting state, muscles consume mainly fats, so maintaining relatively large muscles is important for preventing the accumulation of fats.REFERENCESProgram No. 680.23. 2004 Washington, DC: Society for Neuroscience, 2004.

        "chunk_html": "Sugar issuesSince the first doctor noticed, hundreds of years ago, that the urine of a diabetic patient tasted sweet, it has been common to call the condition the sugar disease, or sugar diabetes, and since nothing was\r\nknown about physiological chemistry, it was commonly believed that eating too much sugar had to be the cause, since the ability of the body to convert the protein in tissues into sugar wasnt discovered until 1848, by Claude Bernard (who realized that diabetics lost more sugar than they took in). Even though patients continued to pass sugar in their urine until they died, despite the elimination of sugar from their diet, medical policy required that they be restrained to keep them from eating sugar. That prescientific medical belief, that eating sugar causes diabetes, is still held by a very large number, probably the majority, of physicians.Originally, diabetes was understood to be a wasting disease, but as\r\nit became common for doctors to measure glucose, obese people were often found to have hyperglycemia, so the name diabetes has been extended to them, as type 2 diabetes. High blood sugar is often seen along with high blood pressure and obesity in Cushing's syndrome, with excess cortisol, and these features are also used to define the newer metabolic syndrome.Following the old reasoning about the sugar disease, the newer kind of obese diabetes is commonly blamed on eating too much sugar. Obesity, especially a fat waist, and all its associated health problems, are said by some doctors to be the result of eating too much sugar, especially fructose. (Starch is the only common carbohydrate that contains\r\nno fructose.) Obesity is associated not only with diabetes or insulin resistance, but also with atheroslcerosis and heart disease, high blood pressure, generalized inflammation, arthritis, depression, risk of dementia, and cancer.There is general agreement about the problems commonly associated with obesity, but not about the causes or the way to prevent or cure obesity and the associated conditions.In an earlier newsletter, I wrote about P. A. Piorry in Paris, in 1864, and Dr. William Budd in England, in 1867,\r\nwho treated diabetes by adding a large amount of ordinary sugar, sucrose, to the patient's diet. Glucose was known to be the sugar appearing in the diabetics' urine, but sucrose consists of half glucose, and half fructose. In 1874, E. Kulz in Germany reported that diabetics could assimilate fructose better than glucose. In the next decades there were several more reports on the benefits of feeding fructose, including the reduction of glucose in the urine. With the discovery of insulin in 1922, fructose therapy was practically forgotten, until the 1950s when new manufacturing techniques began to make it economical to use.Its use in diabetic diets became so popular that it became available in health food\r\nstores, and was also used in hospitals for intravenous feeding.However, while fructose was becoming popular, the cholesterol theory of heart disease was being promoted. This was the theory that eating foods containing saturated fat and cholesterol caused heart disease. (My newsletter, Cholesterol, longevity, intelligence, and health, discussed the development of that theory.)A Swedish physician and researcher, Uffe Ravnskov, has reviewed the medical arguments for the theory that lipids in the blood are the\r\ncause of atherosclerosis and heart disease, and shows that there has never been evidence of causality, something which some people, such as Broda Barnes, understood from the beginning. In the 1950s, an English professor, John Yudkin, didn't accept the idea that eating saturated fat was the cause of high blood levels of triglycerides and cholesterol, but he didnt question the theory that lipids in the blood caused the circulatory disease. He argued that it was sugar, especially the fructose component of sucrose, rather than dietary fat, that caused the high blood lipids seen in the affluent countries, and consequently the diseases. He was sure it was a specific chemical effect of the fructose, because he argued that the nutrients that were removed in refining white flour and white sugar were insignificant, in the whole diet.Following the publication of Yudkin's books, and coinciding with increasing promotion of the health benefits of unsaturated vegetable oils, many people were converted to Yudkin's version of the lipid theory of heart disease, i.e., that the \"bad lipids\" in the blood are the result of eating sugar. This has grown into essentially a cult, in which sugar is believed to act like an intoxicant, forcing people to eat until they become obese, and develop the \"metabolic syndrome,\" and \"diabetes,\" and the many problems that derive from that.The publicity campaign against\r\n\"saturated fat\" as an ally of cholesterol derived its support from the commercial promotion of the polyunsaturated seed oils as food for humans. Although the early investigators of vitamin E knew that the polyunsaturated oils could cause sterility, and others later found that their use in commercial animal foods could cause brain degeneration, there were a few biologists (mostly associated with George Burr) who believed that this type of fatty acid is an essential nutrient.George and Mildred Burr had created what they claimed to be a disease in rats caused by the absence of linoleic or linolenic acid in their food. Although well known researchers had previously published evidence that animals on a fat\r\nfree diet were healthy--even healthier than on a normal diet--Burr and his wife published their contradictory claim without bothering to discuss the conflicting evidence. I haven't seen any instance in which Burr or his followers ever mentioned the conflicting evidence. Although other biologists didn't accept Burr's claims, and several researchers subsequently published contrary results, he later became famous when the seed oil industry wanted scientific-seeming reasons for selling their product as an \"essential\" food. The fact that eating the polyunsaturated fats could cause the blood cholesterol level to decrease slightly was advertised as a health benefit. Later, when human trials showed that more people on the \"heart healthy\" diet died of heart disease and cancer, more conventional means of advertising were used instead of human tests.Burr's experimental diet consisted of purified casein (milk protein) and purified sucrose, supplemented with a vitamin concentrate and some minerals. Several of the B vitamins weren't known at the time, and the mineral mixture lacked zinc, copper, manganese, molybdenum, and selenium. More of the essential nutrients were unknown in his time than in Yudkin's, so his failure to consider the possibility of other nutritional deficiencies affecting health is more understandable.In 1933, Burr observed that his fat-deficient rats consumed oxygen at an extremely high rate,\r\nand even then, the thought didn't occur to him that other nutritional deficiencies might have been involved in the condition he described. Ordinarily, the need for vitamins and minerals corresponds to the rate at which calories are being burned, the metabolic rate. Burr recalled that the rats on the fat free diet drank more water, and he reasoned that the absence of linoleic or linolenic acid in their skin was allowing water vapor to escape at a high rate. He didn't explain why the saturated fats the rats were synthesizing from sugar didn't serve at least as well as a \"vapor barrier\"; they are more effective at water-proofing than unsaturated fats, because of their greater hydrophobicity. The condensed and cross-linked keratin protein in skin cells is the main reason for the skin's relatively low permeability. When an animal is burning calories at a higher rate, its sweat glands are more actively maintaining\r\na normal body temperature, cooling by evaporation; the amount of water evaporated is an approximate measure of metabolic rate, and of thyroid function.In 1936, a man in Burr's lab, William Brown, agreed to eat a similar diet for six months, to see whether the \"essential fatty acid deficiency\" affected humans as it did rats.The diet was very similar to the rats', with a large part of the daily 2500 calories being provided at hourly intervals during the day by sugar syrup (flavored with citric acid and anise oil),\r\nprotein from 4 quarts of special fat-free skimmed milk, a quart of which was made into cottage cheese, the juice of half an orange, and a \"biscuit\" made with potato starch, baking powder, mineral oil, and salt, with iron, viosterol (vitamin D), and carotene supplemented.Brown had suffered from weekly migraine headaches since childhood, and his blood pressure was a little high when he began the diet. After six weeks on the diet, his migraines stopped, and never returned. His plasma inorganic phosphorus declined slightly during the experiment (3.43 mg./100 cc. of plasma and 2.64 on the diet, and after six months on a normal diet 4.2 mg.%), and his total serum proteins increased from 6.98 gm.% to 8.06 gm.%\r\non the experimental diet. His leucocyte count was lower on the high sugar diet, but he didn't experience colds or other sickness. On a normal diet, his systolic blood pressure varied from 140 to 150 mm. of mercury, the diastolic, 95 to 100. After a few months on the sugar and milk diet, his blood pressure had lowered to about 130 over 85 to 88. Several months after he returned to a normal diet, his blood pressure rose to the previous level.On a normal diet, his weight was 152 pounds, and his metabolic rate was from 9% to 12% below normal, but after six months on the diet it had increased to 2% below normal. After three months on the sugar and milk diet, his weight leveled off at 138 pounds. After being on the\r\ndiet, when he ate 2000 calories of sugar and milk within two hours, his respiratory quotient would exceed 1.0, but on his normal diet his maximum respiratory quotient following those foods was less than 1.0.The effect of diabetes is to keep the respiratory quotient low, since a respiratory quotient of one corresponds to the oxidation of pure carbohydrate, and extreme diabetics oxidize fat in preference to carbohydrate, and may have a quotient just a little above 0.7. The results of Brown's and Burr's experiments could be interpreted to mean that the polyunsaturated fats not only lower the metabolic rate, but especially interfere with the metabolism of sugars. In other words, they suggest that the normal diet\r\nis diabetogenic.During the six months of the experiment, the unsaturation of Brown's serum lipids decreased. The authors reported that \"There was no essential change in the serum cholesterol as a result of the change in diet.\" However, in November and December, two months before the experiment began, it had been 252 mg.% in two measurements. At the beginning of the test, it was 298, two weeks later, 228, and four months later, 206 mg%. The total quantity of lipids in his blood didn't seem to change much, since the triglycerides increased as the cholesterol decreased.By the time of Brown's experiment, other researchers had demonstrated that the cholesterol level was increased in hypothyroidism, and decreased as thyroid function, and oxygen consumption, increased. If Burr's team had been reading the medical literature, they would have understood the relation between Brown's increased metabolic rate and decreased cholesterol level. But they did record the facts, which is valuable.The authors wrote that \"The most interesting subjective effect of the 'fat-free' regimen was the definite disappearance of a feeling of fatigue at the end of the day's work.\"A lowered metabolic rate and energy production is a common feature of aging and most degenerative diseases. From the beginning of an animal's life, sugars are the primary source of energy, and with maturation and aging there is a shift toward replacing sugar oxidation with fat oxidation. Old people are able to metabolize fat at the same rate as younger people, but their overall metabolic rate is lower, because they are unable to oxidize sugar at the same high rate as young people. Fat people have a similar selectively reduced ability to oxidize sugar.Stress and starvation lead to a relative reliance on the fats stored in the tissues, and the mobilization of these as circulating free fatty acids contributes to a slowing of metabolism and a shift away from the use of glucose for energy. This is adaptive in the short term, since relatively little glucose is stored in the tissues (as glycogen), and the proteins making up the body would be rapidly consumed for energy, if it were not for the reduced energy demands resulting from the effects of the free fatty acids.One of the points at which fatty acids suppress the use of glucose is at the point at which it is converted into fructose, in the process of glycolysis. When fructose\r\nis available, it can by-pass this barrier to the use of glucose, and continue to provide pyruvic acid for continuing oxidative metabolism, and if the mitochondria themselves aren't providing sufficient energy, it can leave the cell as lactate, allowing continuing glycolytic energy production. In the brain, this can sustain life in an emergency.Many people lately have been told, as part of a campaign to explain the high incidence of fatty liver degeneration in the US, supposedly resulting from eating too much sugar, that fructose can be metabolized only by the liver. The liver does have the highest capacity for metabolizing fructose, but the other organs do metabolize it.If fructose can by-pass the fatty acids' inhibition of glucose metabolism, to be oxidized when glucose can't, and if the metabolism of diabetes involves the oxidation of fatty acids instead of glucose, then we would expect there to be less than the normal amount of fructose in the serum of diabetics, although their defining trait is the presence of an increased amount of glucose. According to Osuagwu and Madumere (2008), that is the case. If a fructose deficiency exists in diabetes, then it is appropriate to supplement it in the diet.Besides\r\nbeing one of the forms of sugar involved in ordinary energy production, interchangeable with glucose, fructose has some special functions, that aren't as well performed by glucose. It is the main sugar involved in reproduction, in the seminal fluid and intrauterine fluid, and in the developing fetus. After these crucial stages of life are past, glucose becomes the primary molecular source of energy, except when the system is under stress. It has been suggested (Jauniaux, et al., 2005) that the predominance of fructose rather than glucose in the embryo's environment helps to maintain ATP and the oxidative state (cellular redox potential) during development in the low-oxygen environment. The placenta turns glucose from the mother's blood into fructose, and the fructose in the mother's blood can pass through into the fetus, and although glucose can move back from the fetus into the mother's blood, fructose\r\nis unable to move in that direction, so a high concentration is maintained in the fluids around the fetus.The control of the redox potential is sometimes called the \"redox signalling system,\" since it coherently affects all processes and conditions in the cell, including pH and hydrophobicity. For example, when a cell prepares to divide, the balance shifts strongly away from the oxidative condition, with increases in the ratios of NADH to NAD+, of GSH to GSSG, and of lactate to pyruvate. These same shifts occur during most kinds of stress.In natural stress, decreased availability of oxygen or nutrients is often the key problem, and many poisons can produce similar interference with energy production, for example cyanide or carbon monoxide, which block the use of oxygen, or ethanol, which inhibits the oxidation of sugars, fats, and amino acids (Shelmet, et al., 1988).When oxygen isn't constantly removing electrons from cells (being chemically reduced by them) those electrons will react elsewhere, creating free radicals (including activated oxygen) and reduced iron, that will create inappropriate chemical reactions (Niknahad, et al., 1995; MacAllister, et al., 2011).Stresses and poisons of many different types, interfering with the normal flow of electrons to oxygen, produce large amounts of free radicals, which can spread structural and chemical damage, involving all systems of the cell. Ethyl alcohol is a common potentially toxic substance that can have this effect, causing oxidative damage by allowing an excess of electrons to accumulate in the cell, shifting the cells' balance away from the stable oxidized state.Fructose has been known for many years to accelerate the oxidation of ethanol (by about 80%).\r\nOxygen consumption in the presence of ethanol is increased by fructose more than by glucose (Thieden and Lundquist, 1967). Besides removing the alcohol from the body more quickly, it prevents the oxidative damage, by maintaining or restoring the cell's redox balance, the relatively oxidized state of the NADH/NAD+, lactate/pyruvate, and GSH/GSSH systems. Although glucose has this stabilizing, pro-oxidative function in many situations, this is a general feature of fructose, sometimes allowing it to have the opposite effect of glucose on the cell's redox state. It seems to be largely this generalized shift of the cell's redox state towards oxidation that is behind the ability of a small amount of fructose to catalyze the more rapid oxidation of a large amount of glucose.Besides protecting against the reductive stresses, fructose can also protect against the oxidative stress of increased hydrogen peroxide (Spasojevic, et al., 2009). Its metabolite, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, is even more effective as an antioxidant.Keeping the metabolic rate high has many benefits, including the rapid renewal of cells and their components, such as cholesterol and other lipids, and proteins, which are always susceptible to damage from oxidants, but the high metabolic rate also tends to keep the redox system in the proper balance, reducing the rate of oxidative damage.Endotoxin absorbed from the intestine is one of the ubiquitous stresses that tends to cause free radical damage. Fructose, probably more than glucose, is protective against damage from endotoxin.Many stressors cause capillary leakage, allowing albumin and other blood components to enter extracellular spaces or to be lost in the urine, and this is a feature of diabetes, obesity, and a variety of inflammatory and degenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (Szekanecz and Koch, 2008; Ujiie, et al., 2003). Although\r\nthe mechanism isn't understood, fructose supports capillary integrity; fructose feeding for 4 and 8 weeks caused a 56% and 51% reduction in capillary leakage, respectively (Chakir, et al., 1998; Plante, et al., 2003).The ability of the mitochondria to oxidize pyruvic acid and glucose is characteristically lost to some degree in cancer. When this oxidation fails, the disturbed redox balance of the cell will usually lead to the cell's death, but if it can survive, this balance favors growth and cell division, rather than differentiated function. This was Otto Warburg's discovery, that was rejected by official medicine for 75 years.Cancer researchers have become interested in this enzyme system that controls the oxidation of pyruvic acid (and thus sugar) by the mitochondria, since these enzymes are crucially defective in cancer cells (and also in diabetes). The chemical DCA, dichloroacetate, is effective against a variety of cancers, and it acts by reactivating the enzymes that oxidize pyruvic acid. Thyroid hormone, insulin, and fructose also activate these enzymes. These are the enzymes that are inactivated by excessive exposure to fatty acids, and that are involved in the progressive replacement of sugar oxidation by fat oxidation, during stress and aging, and in degenerative diseases; for example, a process that inactivates the energy-producing pyruvate dehydrogenase in Alzheimer's disease\r\nhas been identified (Ishiguro, 1998). Niacinamide, by lowering free fatty acids and regulating the redox system, supporting sugar oxidation, is useful in the whole spectrum of metabolic degenerative diseases.A few times in the last 80 years, people (starting with Nasonov) have recognized that the hydrophobicity of a cell changes with its degree of excitation, and with its energy level. Recently, even in non-living physical-chemical systems, hydrophobicity and redox potential have been seen to vary together and to influence each other. Recent work shows how the oxidation of fatty acids contributes to the dissolution of mitochondria (Macchioni, et al., 2010). At first glance it might seem odd that the\r\npresence of fatty material could reduce the \"fat loving\" (lipophilic, equivalent to hydrophobic) property of a cell, but the fat used as fuel is in the form of fatty acids, which are soap-like, and spontaneously introduce \"wetness\" into the relatively water-resistant cell substance. The presence of fatty acids, impairing the last oxidative stage of respiration, increases the tendency of the mitochondrion to release its cytochrome c into the cell in a reduced form, leading to the apoptotic death of the cell. The oxidized form of the cytochrome is more hydrophobic, and stable.Burr didn't understand that it was his rats' high sugar diet, freed of the anti-oxidative unsaturated fatty acids, that caused their\r\nextremely high metabolic rate, but since that time many experiments have made it clear that it is specifically the fructose component of sucrose that is protective against the antimetabolic fats.Although Brown, et al., weren't focusing on the biological effects of sugar, their results are important in the history of sugar research because their work was done before the culture had been influenced by the development of the lipid theory of heart disease, and the later idea that fructose is responsible for increasing the blood lipids.In 1963 and 1964, experiments (Carroll, 1964) showed that the effects of glucose and fructose were radically affected by the type of fat in the diet. Although 0.6% of calories as polyunsaturated fat prevents the appearance of the Mead acid (which is considered to indicate a deficiency of essential fats) the \"high fructose\" diets consistently add 10% or more corn oil or other highly unsaturated fat to the diet. These large quantities of PUFA aren't necessary to prevent a deficiency, but they are needed to obscure the beneficial effects of fructose.Many studies have found that sucrose is less fattening than starch or glucose, that is, that more calories can be consumed without gaining\r\nweight. During exercise, the addition of fructose to glucose increases the oxidation of carbohydrate by about 50% (Jentjens and Jeukendrup, 2005). In another experiment, rats were fed either sucrose or Coca-Cola and Purina chow, and were allowed to eat as much as they wanted (Bukowiecki, et al, 1983). They consumed 50% more calories without gaining extra weight, relative to the standard diet. Ruzzin, et al. (2005) observed rats given a 10.5% or 35% sucrose solution, or water, and observed that the sucrose increased their energy consumption by about 15% without increasing weight gain. Macor, et al. (1990) found that glucose caused a smaller increase in metabolic rate in obese people than in normal weight people, but that fructose increased their metabolic rate as much as it did that of the normal weight people. Tappy, et al. (1993) saw a similar increase in heat production in obese people, relative to the\r\neffect of glucose. Brundin, et al. (1993) compared the effects of glucose and fructose in healthy people, and saw a greater oxygen consumption with fructose, and also an increase in the temperature of the blood, and a greater increase in carbon dioxide production.These metabolic effects have led several groups to recommend the use of fructose for treating shock, the stress of surgery, or infection (e.g., Adolph, et al., 1995).The commonly recommended alternative to sugar in the diet is starch, but many\r\nstudies show that it produces all of the effects that are commonly ascribed to sucrose and fructose, for example hyperglycemia (Villaume, et al., 1984) and increased weight gain. The addition of fructose to glucose \"can markedly reduce hyperglycemia during intraportal glucose infusion by increasing net hepatic glucose uptake even when insulin secretion is compromised\" (Shiota, et al., 2005). \"Fructose appears most effective in those normal individuals who have the poorest glucose tolerance\" (Moore, et al., 2000).Lipid peroxidation is involved in the degenerative diseases, and many publications argue that fructose increases it, despite the fact that it can increase the production of uric acid, which is a\r\nmajor component of our endogenous antioxidant system (e.g., Waring, et al., 2003). When rats were fed for 8 weeks on a diet with 18% fructose and 11% saturated fatty acids, the content of polyunsatured fats in the blood decreased, as they had in the Brown, et al., experiment, and their total antioxidant status was increased (Girard, et al., 2005). When stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats were given 60% fructose, superoxide dismutase in their liver was increased, and the authors suggest that this \"may constitute an early protective mechanism\" (Brosnan and Carkner, 2008). When people were given a 300 calorie drink containing glucose, or fructose, or orange juice, those receiving the glucose had a large increase in oxidative and inflammatory stress (reactive oxygen species, and NF-kappaB binding), and those changes were absent in those receiving the fructose or orange juice (Ghanim, et al.,\r\n2007).One of the observations in Brown, et al., was that the level of phosphate in the serum decreased during the experimental diet. Several later studies show that fructose increases the excretion of phosphate in the urine, while decreasing the level in the serum. However, a common opinion is that it's only the phosphorylation of fructose, increasing the amount in cells, that causes the decrease in the serum; that could account for the momentary drop in serum phosphate during a fructose load, but--since there is only so much phosphate that can be bound to intracellular fructose--it can't account for the chronic depression of the serum phosphate on a continuing diet of fructose or sucrose.There are many reasons to think that a slight reduction of serum phosphate would be beneficial. It has been suggested that eating fruit is protective against prostate cancer, by lowering serum phosphate (Kapur, 2000). The aging suppressing gene discovered in 1997, named after the Greek life-promoting goddess Klotho, suppresses the reabsorption of phosphate by the kidney (which is also a function of the parathyroid hormone), and inhibits the formation of the activated form of vitamin D, opposing the effect of the parathyroid hormone. In the absence of the gene, serum phosphate is high, and the animal ages and dies prematurely. In humans, in recent years a very close association has been has been documented between\r\nincreased phosphate levels, within the normal range, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Serum phosphate is increased in people with osteoporosis (Gallagher, et al., 1980), and various treatments that lower serum phosphate improve bone mineralization, with the retention of calcium phosphate (Ma and Fu, 2010; Batista, et al., 2010; Kelly, et al., 1967; Parfitt, 1965; Kim, et al., 2003).At high altitude, or when taking a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, there is more carbon dioxide in the blood, and the serum phosphate is lower; sucrose and fructose increase the respiratory quotient and carbon dioxide production, and this is probably a factor in lowering the serum phosphate.Fructose affects the body's ability to retain other nutrients, including magnesium, copper, calcium, and other minerals. Comparing diets with 20% of the calories from fructose or from cornstarch, Holbrook, et al. (1989) concluded \"The results indicate that dietary fructose enhances mineral balance.\" Ordinarily, things (such as thyroid and vitamin D) which improve the retention of magnesium and other nutrients are considered good, but the fructose mythology allows researchers to conclude, after finding an increased magnesium balance, with either 4% or 20% of energy from fructose (compared to cornstarch, bread, and rice), \"that dietary fructose adversely affects macromineral homeostasis in humans.\" (Milne and Nielsen, 2000).Another study compared the effects of a diet with plain water, or water containing 13% glucose, or sucrose, or fructose, or high fructose corn syrup on the properties of rats' bones: Bone mineral density and mineral content, and bone strength, and mineral balance. The largest differences were between animals drinking the glucose and the fructose solutions. The rats getting the glucose had reduced phosphorus in their bones, and more calcium in their urine, than the rats that got fructose. \"The results suggested that glucose rather than fructose exerted more deleterious effects on mineral balance and bone\" (Tsanzi, et al., 2008).An older experiment compared two groups with an otherwise well balanced diet, lacking vitamin D, containing either 68% starch or 68% sucrose. A third group got the starch diet, but with added vitamin D. The rats on the vitamin D deficient starch diet had very low levels of calcium in their blood, and the calcium content of their bones was low, exactly what is expected with the vitamin D deficiency. However, the rats on the sucrose diet, also vitamin D deficient, had normal levels of calcium in their blood. The sucrose, unlike the starch, maintained claim homeostasis. A radioactive calcium tracer showed normal uptake by the bone, and also apparently normal bone development, although their bones were lighter than those receiving vitamin D.People have told me that when they looked for articles on fructose in PubMed they couldn't find anything except articles about its bad effects. There are two reasons for that. PubMed, like the earlier Index Medicus, represents the material in the National Library of Medicine, and is a medical, rather than a scientific, database, and there is a large amount of important research that it ignores. And because of the authoritarian and conformist nature of the medical profession, when a researcher observes something that is contrary to majority opinion, the title of the publication is unlikely to focus on that. In too many articles in medical journals, the title and conclusions positively misrepresent the data reported in the article.When the idea of \"glycemic index\" was being popularized by dietitians, it was already known that starch, consisting of chains of glucose molecules, had a much higher index than fructose and sucrose. The more rapid appearance of glucose in the blood stimulates more insulin, and insulin stimulates fat synthesis, when there is more glucose than can be oxidized immediately. If starch or glucose is eaten at the same time as polyunsaturated fats, which inhibit its oxidation, it will produce more fat. Many animal experiments show this, even when they are intending to show the dangers of fructose and sucrose.For example (Thresher, et al., 2000), rats were fed diets with 68% carbohydrate, 12% fat (corn oil), and 20% protein. In one group the carbohydrate was starch (cornstarch and maltodextrin, with a glucose equivalence of 10%), and in other groups it was either 68% sucrose, or 34% fructose and 34% glucose, or 34% fructose and 34% starch.  (An interesting oddity, fasting triglycerides were highest in the fructose+starch group.)The weight of their fat pads (epididymal, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric) was greatest in the fructose+starch group, and least in the sucrose group. The starch group's fat\r\nwas intermediate in weight between those of the sucrose and the fructose+glucose groups.At the beginning of the experimental diet, the average weight of the animals was 213.1 grams. After five weeks, the animals in the fructose+glucose group gained 164 grams, those in the sucrose group gained 177 grams, and those in the starch group gained 199.2 grams. The animals ate as much of the diet as they wanted, and those in the sucrose group ate the least.The purpose of their study was to see whether fructose causes\r\n\"glucose intolerance\" and \"insulin resistance.\" Since insulin stimulates appetite (Chance, et al, 1986; Dulloo and Girardier, 1989; Czech, 1988; DiBattista, 1983; Sonoda, 1983; Godbole and York, 1978), and fat synthesis, the reduced food consumption and reduced weight gain show that fructose was protecting against these potentially harmful effects of insulin.Much of the current concern about the dangers of fructose is focussed on the cornstarch-derived high fructose corn syrup, HFCS. Many studies assume that its composition is nearly all fructose and glucose. However, Wahjudi, et al. (2010) analyzed samples of it before and after hydrolyzing it in acid, to break down other carbohydrates present in it. They\r\nfound that the carbohydrate content was several times higher than the listed values. \"The underestimation of carbohydrate content in beverages may be a contributing factor in the development of obesity in children,\" and it's especially interesting that so much of it is present in the form of starch-like materials.Many people are claiming that fructose consumption has increased greatly in the last 30 or 40 years, and that this is responsible for the epidemic of obesity and diabetes. According to the USDA Economic Research Service, the 2007 calorie consumption as flour and cereal products increased 3% from 1970, while added sugar calories decreased 1%. Calories from meats, eggs, and nuts decreased 4%, from dairy\r\nfoods decreased 3%, and calories from added fats increased 7%. The percentage of calories from fruits and vegetables stayed the same. The average person consumed 603 calories per day more in 2007 than in 1970. If changes in the national diet are responsible for the increase of obesity, diabetes, and the diseases associated with them, then it would seem that the increased consumption of fat and starch is responsible, and that would be consistent with the known effects of starches and polyunsaturated fats.In monkeys living in the wild, when their diet is mainly fruit, their cortisol is low, and it rises when they eat a diet with less sugar (Behie, et al., 2010). Sucrose consumption lowers ACTH, the main\r\npituitary stress hormone (Klement, et al., 2009; Ulrich-Lai, et al., 2007), and stress promotes increased sugar and fat consumption (Pecoraro, et al., 2004). If animals' adrenal glands are removed, so that they lack the adrenal steroids, they choose to consume more sucrose (Laugero, et al., 2001). Stress seems to be perceived as a need for sugar. In the absence of sucrose, satisfying this need with starch and fat is more likely to lead to obesity.The glucocorticoid hormones inhibit the metabolism of sugar. Sugar is essential for brain development and maintenance. The effects of environmental stimulation and deprivation-stress can be detected in the thickness of the brain cortex in as little as 4 days in\r\ngrowing rats (Diamond, et al., 1976). These effects can persist through a lifetime, and are even passed on transgenerationally. Experimental evidence shows that polyunsaturated (omega-3) fats retard fetal brain development, and that sugar promotes it. These facts argue against some of the currently popular ideas of the evolution of the human brain based on ancestral diets of fish or meat, which only matters as far as those anthropological theories are used to argue against fruits and other sugars in the present diet.Honey has been used therapeutically for thousands of years, and recently there has been some research documenting a variety of uses, including treatment of ulcers and colitis, and other\r\ninflammatory conditions. Obesity increases mediators of inflammation, including the C-reactive protein (CRP) and homocysteine. Honey, which contains free fructose and free glucose, lowers CRP and homocysteine, as well as triglycerides, glucose, and cholesterol, while it increased insulin more than sucrose did (Al-Waili, 2004). Hypoglycemia intensifies inflammatory reactions, and insulin can reduce inflammation if sugar is available. Obesity, like diabetes, seems to involve a cellular energy deficiency, resulting from the inability to metabolize sugar.Sucrose (and sometimes honey) is increasingly being used to reduce pain in newborns, for minor things such as injections (Guala, et al., 2001; Okan, et al., 2007;\r\nAnand, et al., 2005; Schoen and Fischell, 1991). It's also effective in adults. It acts by influencing a variety of nerve systems, and also reduces stress. Insulin is probably involved in sugar analgesia, as it is in inflammation, since it promotes entry of endorphins into the brain (Witt, et al., 2000).An extracellular phosphorylated fructose metabolite, diphosphoglycerate, has an essential regulatory effect in the blood; another fructose metabolite, fructose diphosphate, can reduce mast cell histamine release and protect against oxidative and hypoxic injury and endotoxic shock, and it reduces the expression of the inflammation mediators TNF-alpha, IL-6, nitric oxide synthase, and the activation of NF-kappaB,\r\namong other protective effects, and its therapeutic value is known, but its relation to dietary sugars hasn't been investigated.A daily diet that includes two quarts of milk and a quart of orange juice provides enough fructose and other sugars for general resistance to stress, but larger amounts of fruit juice, honey, or other sugars can  protect against increased stress, and can reverse some of the established degenerative conditions.Refined granulated sugar is extremely pure, but it lacks all of the\r\nessential nutrients, so it should be considered as a temporary therapeutic material, or as an occasional substitute when good fruit isn't available, or when available honey is allergenic.REFERENCESAnaesthesist  1995 Nov;44(11):770-81.

        "chunk_html": "Glucose and sucrose for diabetesDiabetes has been known since ancient times as a wasting disease in which sugar was lost in the urine, but more recently the name has been used to describe the presence of more than the normal amount of glucose in the blood, even in the absence of glucose in the urine. Some of the medical ideas regarding the original form of the condition have been applied to the newer form.Cultural \"paradigms\" or ideologies are so convenient that people often don't bother to doubt them, and they are sometimes so rigorously enforced that people learn to keep their doubts to themselves. Public concern about diabetes has been growing for decades, but despite the introduction of insulin and other drugs to treat it, and massive campaigns to\r\n\"improve\" eating habits, mortality from diabetes has been increasing during the last 100 years. Diabetes (\"type 1\") has been increasing even among children (Barat, et al., 2008).A basic meaning of homeopathic medicine is the support of the organism's ability to heal itself; the essence of allopathy is that the physician fights \"a disease\" to cure the patient, e.g., by cutting out tumors or killing germs.Confidence in the organism's essential rationality led the doctors with a homeopathic orientation to see a fever as part of a recuperative process, while their allopathic opponents sometimes saw fever as the essence of the sickness to be cured. Homeopaths concentrated on the nature of the patient; allopaths concentrated on a disease entity in itself, and were likely to ignore the patient's idiosyncrasies and preferences.Diabetes was named for the excessive urination it causes, and for the sugar in the\r\nurine. It was called the sugar disease, and physicians were taught that sugar was the problem. Patients were ordered to avoid sweet foods, and in hospitals they were sometimes locked up to keep them from finding sweets. The practice was derived from ideology, not from any evidence that the treatment helped.In 1857, M. Piorry in Paris and William Budd in Bristol, England, reasoned that if a patient was losing a pound of sugar every day in 10 liters of urine, and was losing weight very rapidly, and had an intense craving for sugar, it would be reasonable to replace some of the lost sugar, simply because the quick weight loss of diabetes invariably led to death. Keeping patients from eating what they craved seemed both cruel and futile.After Budd's detailed reports of a woman's progressive recovery over a period of several weeks when he prescribed 8 ounces of sugar every day, along with a normal diet including beef and\r\nbeef broth, a London physician, Thomas Williams, wrote sarcastically about Budd's metaphysical ideas, and reported his own trial of a diet that he described as similar to Budd's. But after two or three days he decided his patients were getting worse, and stopped the experiment.Williams' publication was presented as a scientific refutation of Budd's deluded homeopathic ideas, but Budd hadn't explained his experiment as anything more than an attempt to slow the patient's death from wasting which was sure to be the result of losing so much sugar in the urine. The following year Budd described another patient, a young man who had become too weak to work and who was losing weight at an extreme rate. Budd's prescription included 8 ounces of white sugar and 4 ounces of honey every day, and again, instead of increasing the amount of glucose in the urine, the amount decreased quickly as the patient began eating almost as much sugar as was\r\nbeing lost initially, and then as the loss of sugar in the urine decreased, the patient gained weight and recovered his strength.Drs. Budd and Piorry described patients recovering from an incurable disease, and that has usually been enough to make the medical profession antagonistic. Even when a physician has himself diagnosed diabetes and told a patient that it would be necessary to inject insulin for the rest of his life, if that patient recovers by changing his diet, the physician will typically say that the diagnosis was wrong, because diabetes is incurable.Twenty-five years ago, some rabbits were made diabetic with a poison that killed their insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells, and when some of them recovered from the diabetes after being given supplemental DHEA, it was found that their beta-cells had regenerated. The more recent interest in stem cells has led several research groups to acknowledge that in\r\nanimals the insulin-producing cells are able to regenerate.It is now conceivable that there will be an effort to understand the factors that damage the beta-cells, and the factors that allow them to regenerate. The observations of Budd and Piorry would be a good place to start such a reconsideration.For many years, physicians have been taught that diabetes is either \"genetic\" or possibly caused by a viral infection, that might trigger an \"autoimmune reaction,\" but the study of cellular respiration and energy metabolism and endocrinology has provided more convincing explanations. The antibodies that are found in the \"autoimmune\" conditions are evidence of tissue damage, but the damage may have been done by metabolic toxins, with the immune system's involvement being primarily the removal of defective cells.In the 1940s, Bernardo Houssay found that coconut oil protected animals from\r\npoison-induced diabetes, while a lard-based diet failed to protect them. Later, glucose itself was found to protect the pancreatic beta-cells from poisons.In 1963, P.J. Randle clearly described the inhibition of glucose oxidation by free fatty acids. Later, when lipid emulsions came into use for intravenous feeding in hospitals, it was found that they blocked glucose oxidation, lowered the metabolic rate, suppressed immunity, and increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress.Estrogen and stress are both known to create some of the conditions of diabetes, while increasing fat oxidation and inhibiting glucose oxidation. Emotional stress, overwork, trauma, and infections have been known to initiate diabetes. Estrogen increases free fatty acids and decreases glycogen storage, and when birth control pills were becoming popular, some researchers warned that they might cause diabetes. But the food oil industry and the estrogen industry\r\nwere satisfied with the medical doctrine that diabetes was caused by eating too much sugar.If the essence of diabetes is the presence of too much sugar, then it seems reasonable to argue that it is the excess sugar that's responsible for the suffering and death associated with the disease, otherwise, how would the prohibition of sugar in the diet be justified? In fact, the argument is made (e.g., Muggeo, 1998) that it is the hyperglycemia that causes problems such as hypertension, kidney failure, heart failure, neuropathy, blindness, dementia, and gangrene.As information about the many physiological and biochemical events associated with diabetes has accumulated, the basic doctrine that \"sugar causes diabetes\" has extended itself to whatever the topic of discussion is:\"Glucose causes\" the death of beta-cells, glucose causes blood vessels to become leaky, glucose causes cells to be unable to absorb glucose, glucose causes\r\nthe formation of free radicals, glucose impairs immunity and wound healing, but causes inflammation while preventing the \"respiratory burst\" in which free radicals are produced by cells that cause inflammation, it disturbs enzyme functions, impairs nerve conduction and muscle strength, etc., and it is also addictive, causing people to irrationally seek the very material that is poisoning them.Tens of thousands of publications describe the pathogenic effects of sugar. To prove their point, they grow cells in a culture dish, and find that when they are exposed to excess glucose, often 5 times the normal amount, they deteriorate. In the artificial conditions of cell culture, the oversupply of glucose causes lactic acid to accumulate, leading to toxic effects. But in the organism, the hyperglycemia is compensating for a sensed deficiency of glucose, a need for more energy.If diabetes means that cells can't absorb or\r\nmetabolize glucose, then any cellular function that requires glucose will be impaired, despite the presence of glucose in the blood. It is the intracellular absence of glucose which is problematic, rather than its extracellular excess.Neuroglycopenia (or neuroglucopenia) or intracellular glycopenia refers to the deficit of glucose in cells. When the brain senses a lack of glucose, nerves are activated to increase the amount of glucose in the blood, to correct the problem. As long as the brain senses the need for more glucose, the regulatory systems will make the adjustments to the blood glucose level.The antagonism between fat and sugar that Randle described can involve the suppression of sugar oxidation when the concentration of fats in the bloodstream is increased by eating fatty food, or by releasing fats from the tissues by lipolysis, but it can also involve the suppression of fat oxidation by inhibiting the release of\r\nfatty acids from the tissues, when a sufficient amount of sugar is eaten.When a normal person, or even a \"type 2 diabetic,\" is given a large dose of sugar, there is a suppression of lipolysis, and the concentration of free fatty acids in the bloodstream decreases, though the suppression is weaker in the diabetic (Soriguer, et al., 2008). Insulin, released by the sugar, inhibits lipolysis, reducing the supply of fats to the respiring cells.Free fatty acids suppress mitochondrial respiration (Kamikawa and Yamazaki, 1981), leading to increased glycolysis (producing lactic acid) to maintain cellular energy. The suppression of mitochondrial respiration increases the production of toxic free radicals, and the decreased carbon dioxide makes the proteins more susceptible to attack by free radicals. The lactate produced under the influence of excessive fat metabolism stimulates the release of endorphins, which are lipolytic,\r\nreleasing more free fatty acids from the tissues. Acting through cytokines such as interleukin-6, lactate shifts the balance toward the catabolic hormones, leading to tissue wasting.Lactic acid itself, and the longer chain fatty acids, inhibit the regulatory enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (which is activated by insulin), reducing the oxidative production of energy. Drugs to activate this enzyme are being studied by the pharmaceutical industry as treatments for diabetes and cancer (for example, DCA, dichloroacetate).Oxidative damage of proteins is often described as glycation or glycosylation, but it really consists of many addition and crosslinking reactions, most often onto, or between, lysine groups. Carbon dioxide normally associates with lysine groups, so the destructive reactions are favored when carbon dioxide is displaced by lactic acid. The reactive fragments of polyunsaturated fatty acids are much more often the\r\nsource of the protein-damaging radicals than the carbohydrates are.The importance of the fats in causing type-2 diabetes is coming to be accepted, for example Li, et al., recently (2008) said \"The cellular link between fatty acids and ROS (reactive oxygen species) is essentially the mitochondrion, a key organelle for the control of insulin secretion. Mitochondria are the main source of ROS and are also the primary target of oxidative attacks.\"But much earlier (Wright, et al., 1988) it had been demonstrated that a deficiency of the \"essential fatty acids\" prevents toxin-induced diabetes and greatly increases resistance to inflammation (Lefkowith, et al., 1990). The lack of those so-called \"essential fatty acids\" also prevents autoimmune diabetes in a strain of diabetic mice (Benhamou, et al., 1995),Suppressing fatty acid oxidation improves the contraction of the heart muscle and increases the efficiency of oxygen\r\nuse (Chandler, et al., 2003). Various drugs are being considered for that purpose, but niacinamide is already being used to improve heart function, since it lowers the concentration of free fatty acids.The antimetabolic and toxic effects of the polyunsaturated fatty acids can account for the \"insulin resistance\" that characterizes type-2 diabetes, but similar actions in the pancreatic beta-cells can impair or kill those cells, creating a deficiency of insulin, resembling type-1 diabetes.The suppression of mitochondrial respiration causes increased free radical damage, and the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the suppressed cell increases the rate of fat decomposition and production of toxins.Increasing the rate of respiration by replacing the fats with glucose reduces the availability of electrons that can trigger lipid peroxidation and produce toxic free radicals, and the shift of fuel also increases the\r\namount of carbon dioxide produced, which can protect the protein amino groups such as lysine from glycation and lipoxidation.While it's clear that it is the excessive oxidation of fat that damages cells in the \"diabetic\" state in which cells aren't able to use glucose, it's important to look at some of the situations in which so many researchers are blaming problems on hyperglycemia.Important problems in diabetes are slow wound healing, excessive permeability or leakiness of blood vessels which allows molecules such as albumin to be extravasated, and the impaired function and survival of pancreatic beta-cells.During the healing of a wound in a diabetic individual, the local concentration of glucose decreases and then entirely disappears, as healing stops. Applying glucose and insulin topically to the wound, it heals quickly. The very old practice of treating deep wounds with honey or granulated sugar has been\r\nstudied in controlled situations, including the treatment of diabetic ulcers, infected deep wounds following heart surgery, and wounds of lepers. The treatment eradicates bacterial infections better than some antiseptics, and accelerates healing without scarring, or with minimal scarring. The sugar regulates the communication between cells, and optimizes the synthesis of collagen and extracellular matrix.An excess of insulin, causing hypoglycemia, can cause blood vessels, for example in the brain and kidneys, to become leaky, and this has been claimed to be an effect of insulin itself. However, the same leakiness can be produced by an analog of glucose that can't be metabolized, so that intracellular glycopenia is produced. The harmful effect that has been ascribed to excessive insulin can be prevented by maintaining an adequate supply of glucose (Uezu and Murakami, 1993), showing that it is the lack of glucose, rather than the\r\nexcess insulin, that causes the vascular malfunction. Fructose also reduces the leakiness of blood vessels (Plante, et al., 2003). Many of the complications of diabetes are caused by increased vascular leakiness (Simard, et al., 2002).Sugar can protect the beta-cells from the free fatty acids, apparently in the same ways that it protects the cells of blood vessels, restoring metabolic energy and preventing damage to the mitochondria. Glucose suppresses superoxide formation in beta-cells (Martens, et al., 2005) and apparently in other cells including brain cells.(Isaev, et al., 2008).The beta-cell protecting effect of glucose is supported by bicarbonate and sodium. Sodium activates cells to produce carbon dioxide, allowing them to regulate calcium, preventing overstimulation and death. For a given amount of energy released, the oxidation of glucose produces more carbon dioxide and uses less oxygen than the\r\noxidation of fatty acids.The toxic excess of intracellular calcium that damages the insulin-secreting cells in the relative absence of carbon dioxide is analogous to the increased excitation of nerves and muscles that can be produced by hyperventilation.In every type of tissue, it is the failure to oxidize glucose that produces oxidative stress and cellular damage. Even feeding enough sucrose to cause fat deposition in the liver can protect the liver from oxidative stress (Spolarics and Meyenhofer, 2000), possibly by mechanisms such as those involved in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease with saturated fats.The active thyroid hormone, T3, protects the heart by supporting the oxidation of glucose (Liu, et al., 1998). The amount of T3 produced by the liver depends mainly on the amount of glucose available.Animals that have been made diabetic with relatively low\r\ndoses of the poison streptozotocin can recover functional beta-cells spontaneously, and the rate of recovery is higher in pregnant animals (Hartman, et al., 1989). Pregnancy stabilizes blood sugar at a higher level, and progesterone favors the oxidation of glucose rather than fats.A recent study suggests that recovery of the pancreas can be very fast. A little glucose was infused for 4 days into rats, keeping the blood glucose level normal, and the mass of beta-cells was found to have increased 2.5 times. Cell division wasn't increased, so apparently the additional glucose was preventing the death of beta-cells, or stimulating the conversion of another type of cell to become insulin-secreting beta-cells (Jetton, et al., 2008).That study is very important in relation to stem cells in general, because it either means that glandular cells are turning over (\"streaming\") at a much higher rate than currently recognized in biology\r\nand medicine, or it means that (when blood sugar is adequate) stimulated cells are able to recruit neighboring cells to participate in their specialized function. Either way, it shows the great importance of environmental factors in regulating our anatomy and physiology.\"Diabetologists\" don't regularly measure their patients' insulin, but they usually make the assumption that insulin is the main factor regulating blood sugar. In one study, it was found that the insulin molecule itself, immunoreactive insulin, accounted for only about 8% of the serum's insulin-like action. The authors of that study believed that potassium was the main other factor in the serum that promoted the disposition of glucose. Since potassium and glucose are both always present in the blood, their effects on each other have usually been ignored.Cellular activation (by electrical, nervous, chemical, or mechanical stimulation) causes glucose to\r\nbe absorbed and oxidized, even in the absence of insulin and in otherwise insulin-resistant individuals. I think this local interaction between the need for energy and the production of energy predominates in good health, with insulin and other hormones facilitating the process in times of stress. A variety of local tissue regulators, including GABA and glutamate, probably participate in these interactions, in the brain, endocrine glands, muscles, and other tissues, and are probably involved in the relaxing and analgesic actions of the sugars.The GABA system (GABA is highly concentrated in the beta-cells) is involved in regulating blood sugar, inhibiting the release of glucagon when glucose isn't needed, and apparently allowing the beta cells to discriminate between amino acids and glucose (Gu, et al., 1993) and acting as a survival and growth factor for neighboring cells (Ligon, et al., 2007).The damaged\r\nbeta-cells lose the enzyme (glutamate dehydrogenase) that makes GABA, and their ratio of linoleic acid to saturated and monounsaturated fat increases, a change that corresponds to a decreased metabolism of glucose.The free intracellular calcium that can become toxic is normally bound safely by well-energized mitochondria, and in the bloodstream it is kept safely complexed with carbon dioxide. The thyroid hormone, producing carbon dioxide, helps to sustain the level of ionized calcium (Lindblom, et al., 2001). In a vitamin D deficiency, or a calcium deficiency, the parathyroid hormone increases, and this hormone can contribute to many inflammatory and degenerative processes, including diabetes. Consuming enough calcium and vitamin D to keep the parathyroid hormone suppressed is important to protect against the degenerative conditions.When animals were fed an otherwise balanced diet lacking vitamin D, with the addition of\r\neither 68% sucrose or 68% starch, the bones of those on the starch diet failed to develop normally, as would be expected with a vitamin D deficiency, and their serum calcium was low. However, the bones of those on the diet with sucrose developed properly, and didn't show evidence of being calcium deficient, though they weren't quite as heavy as those that also received an adequate amount of vitamin D (Artus, 1975). This study suggests that the famous dietetic emphasis on the \"complex carbohydrates,\" i.e., starches, has made an important contribution to the prevalence of osteoporosis, as well as obesity and other degeneration conditions.Both vitamin D and vitamin K, another important calcium-regulating nutrient, are now known to prevent diabetes. Both of these vitamins require carbon dioxide for disposing of calcium properly, preventing its toxicity. When carbon dioxide is inadequate, for example from simple hyperventilation or from\r\nhypothyroidism, calcium is allowed to enter cells, causing inappropriate excitation, sometimes followed by calcification.Keeping an optimal level of carbon dioxide (for example, when adapted to high altitude) causes calcium to be controlled, resulting in lowered parathyroid hormone, an effect similar to supplementing with calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K. (E.g., Nicolaidou, et al, 2006.) Glycine, like carbon dioxide, protects proteins against oxidative damage (Lezcano, et al., 2006), so including gelatin (very rich in glycine) in the diet is probably protective.The contribution of PTH to inflammation and degeneration is just being acknowledged (e.g., Kuwabara, 2008), but the mechanism undoubtedly involves the fact that it is lipolytic, increasing the concentration of free fatty acids that suppress metabolism and interfere with the use of glucose.When we talk about increasing the metabolic rate, and the\r\nbenefits it produces, we are comparing the rate of metabolism in the presence of thyroid, sugar, salt, and adequate protein to the \"normal\" diet, containing smaller amounts of those \"stimulating\" substances. It would be more accurate if we would speak of the suppressive nature of the habitual diet, in relation to the more optimal diet, which provides more energy for work and adaptation, while minimizing the toxic effects of free radicals.Feeding animals a normal diet with the addition of Coca-Cola, or with a similar amount of sucrose, has been found to let them increase their calorie intake by 50% without increasing their weight gain (Bukowiecki, et al., 1983). Although plain sucrose can alleviate the metabolic suppression of an average diet, the effect of sugars in the diet is much more likely to be healthful in the long run when they are associated with an abundance of minerals, as in milk and fruit, which provide potassium and calcium\r\nand other protective nutrients.Avoiding the starches such as cereals and beans, and using fruits as a major part of the diet helps to minimize the effects of the polyunsaturated fats.Celiac disease or gluten sensitivity is associated with diabetes and hypothyroidism. There is a cross reaction between the gluten protein molecule and an enzyme which is expressed under the influence of estrogen. This is another reason for simply avoiding cereal products.Brewers' yeast has been used traditionally to correct diabetes, and its high content of niacin and other B vitamins and potassium might account for its beneficial effects. However, eating a large quantity of it is likely to cause gas, so some people prefer to extract the soluble nutrients with hot water. Yeast contains a considerable amount of estrogen, and the water extract probably leaves much of that in the insoluble starchy residue. Liver is\r\nanother rich source of the B vitamins as well as the oily vitamins, but it can suppress thyroid function, so usually one meal a week is enough.The supplements that most often help to correct diabetes-like conditions are niacinamide, thiamine, thyroid, and progesterone or pregnenolone. Vitamins D and K are clearly protective against developing diabetes, and their effects on many regulatory processes suggest that they would also help to correct existing hyperglycemia.Drinking coffee seems to be very protective against developing diabetes. Its niacin and magnesium are clearly important, but it is also a rich source of antioxidants, and it helps to maintain normal thyroid and progesterone production. Chocolate is probably protective too, and it is a good source of magnesium and antioxidants.A recent study (Xia, et al., 2008) showed that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by beta-cells impairs insulin synthesis,\r\nand that replenishing cholesterol restores the insulin secretion. Green tea contains this type of inhibitor, but its use has nevertheless been associated with a reduced risk of diabetes. Caffeine is likely to be the main protective substance in these foods.Although antioxidants can be protective against diabetes, not all things sold as \"antioxidants\" are safe; many botannical \"antioxidants\" are estrogenic. Hundreds of herbal products can lower blood sugar, but many of them are simply toxic, and the reduction of blood glucose can make some problems worse.The supplements I mention above--including caffeine--have antiinflammatory, antioxidative and energy-promoting effects. Inflammation, interfering with cellular energy production, is probably the essential feature of the things called diabetes.Aspirin has a very broad spectrum of antiinflammatory actions, and is increasingly being recommended for\r\npreventing complications of diabetes. One of the consequences of inflammation is hyperglycemia, and aspirin helps to correct that (Yuan, et al., 2001), while protecting proteins against oxidative damage (Jafarnejad, et al, 2001).If Dr. Budd's thinking (and results) had been more widely accepted when his publications appeared, thinking about \"diabetes\" might have led to earlier investigation of the syndromes of stress and tissue wasting, with insulin being identified as just one of many regulatory substances, and a large amount of useless and harmful activity treating hyperglycemia as the enemy, rather than part of an adaptive reaction, might have been avoided.REFERENCESAnn Nutr Aliment.\r\n1975;29(4):305-12.[Effects of administering diets with starch or sucrose basis on certain parameters of calcium metabolism in the young, growing rat]Artus M.Diabetes Metab. 2008 Oct 24.The growing incidence of type 1 diabetes in children: The 17-year French experience in Aquitaine.Barat P, Valade A, Brosselin P, Alberti C, Maurice-Tison S, Lévy-Marchal C.Pancreas. 1995 Jul;11(1):26-37.Essential fatty acid deficiency prevents autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice through a positive impact on antigen-presenting cells and Th2 lymphocytes.Benhamou PY, Mullen Y, Clare-Salzler M, Sangkharat A, Benhamou C, Shevlin L, Go VL.The Retrospect of Medicine, XXXVII January-June, 1858 Edited by W.

They also influence the judgments people make about their own health, and, too often, the way physicians treat their patients.The prevalence of chronic constipation in North America has been estimated to be 27%, and in a ten year study, the occurrence of new cases was about 16%.--the prevalence increases with aging. In some studies, women are 3 times as likely as men to suffer from constipation. A recent Canadian article commented that While chronic constipation (CC) has a high prevalence\r\nin primary care, there are no existing treatment recommendations to guide health care professionals.Almost everyone in the US is familiar with the idea of laxative abuse, of using laxatives when they arent absolutely necessary, and with the idea that chronic laxative use will create a dependency, the way an addictive drug does. Contemporary doctors are likely to prescribe stool softeners for constipated old people, rather than stimulant laxatives, probably because softener doesnt have the pejorative connotation that stimulant drug has--not because there is a scientific basis for the choice.Many doctors advise constipated patients to drink more water and exercise. While there is some physiological basis for recommending exercise, the advice to drink more water is simply unphysiological. A study in Latin America found no evidence of benefit from either of those recommendations, and\r\nrecommended the use of fiber in the diet. The right kind of fiber can benefit a variety of bowel problems. However, some types of fiber can exacerbate the problem, and some types (such as oat bran) have been found to increase bowel cancer in animal studies.Despite the greater prevalence of constipation in women and older people, even specialists in gastroenterology are very unlikely to consider the role of hypothyroidism or other endocrine problems in chronic constipation.Because of the cultural clichés about constipation--that its caused by not eating enough fiber or drinking enough water, for example--and the belief that its not very important, there is seldom an effort made to understand the actual condition of the intestine, and the causes of the problem.Aging and stress increase some of the inflammatory mediators, tending to reduce the barrier function of the bowel, letting larger amounts of bacterial\r\ntoxins enter the bloodstream, interfering with energy metabolism, creating inflammatory vicious circles of increasing leakiness and inflammation.Often people visualize something like a sausage casing when they think of the intestine, but when the intestine is becoming inflamed its wall may swell to become an inch thick. As it thickens, the channel narrows to a few millimeters in diameter, and may even close in some regions. In the swollen, edematous, inflamed condition the contractile mechanism of the smooth muscle is impaired. The failure of contraction is caused by the same structural changes that increase permeability. (Garcia, et al., 1996; Skarsgard, et al., 2000; Plaku and von der Weid, 2006; Uray, et al., 2006; Miller and Sims, 1986; Schouten, et al., 2008; Gosling, et al., 2000.)Obviously, in the very swollen, structurally deformed intestine, with almost no lumen, neither a stimulant nor a simple fibrous bulk\r\ncould restore functioning, because even with stimulation the smooth muscle is unable to contract, and the closed channel wont admit bulk. Even gas is sometimes unable to pass through the inflamed intestine. Mechanical thinking about the intestine fails when inflammation is involved; now that inflammation is known to play an important role in Alzheimers disease and heart disease, it will be more acceptable to consider its role in constipation.The contractile ability of smooth muscle, thats impaired by swelling and inflammation, can be restored by antiinflammatory agents, for example aspirin (or other inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis) or antihistamines. This applies to the muscles of lymphatic vessels (Wu, et al., 2005, 2006; Gosling, 2000), that must function to reduce edema, as well as to the bowel muscles that cause peristalsis.If someone thinks of constipation as the result of a lack of neuromuscular\r\nstimulation, then it might seem reasonable to design a drug that intensifies the contractions produced by one of the natural transmitter substances, such as serotonin, histamine, or acetylcholine. Thats apparently what Novartis did, with tegaserod, a drug that increases the bowels sensitivity to serotonin. That drug, called Zelnorm, was approved by the FDA in 2002, after a couple of years of publications praising it. At the time of its approval, there was already evidence that people using it were more likely to have abdominal surgery, especially for gallbladder disease, and there was doubt about its effectiveness.Strangely, the drug was approved to be used for only 4 to 6 weeks, taking two tablets daily without interruption. When patients benefitted from the first treatment, they might be eligible for an additional 4 to 6 weeks, but then it would be necessary for them to find another way to deal with their\r\nconstipation.Zelnorm side effects: abdominal pain, chest pain, flushing, facial edema, hypertension, hypotension, angina pectoris, syncope, arrythmia, anxiety, vertigo, ovarian cyst, miscarriage, menorrhagia, cholecystitis, appendicitis, bilirubinemia, gastroenteritis, increased creatine phosphokinase. back pain, cramps,breast cancer, attempted suicide,impaired concentration, increased appetite, sleep disorder, depression, anxiety, asthma, increased sweating, renal pain, polyuria. (Later, it was found to cause heart attacks and intestinal ischemia/necrosis.) Why would the FDA approve a drug, without evidence that it was more effective than harmless things that were already widely available?Zelnorm Prices ~ In the US, Novartis estimates that Zelnorm tablets will sell for somewhere in the range of $3 to $4 each. The drug is expected to generate $1 billion in annual sales for Novartis.During\r\nthe years just before the new drug was approved, there were several publications reporting that emodin, the main active factor in cascara, a traditional laxative, had some remarkable antiviral and anticancer activities. Other studies were reporting that it protected against some known mutagens and carcinogens. Less than 3 months before approving Zelnorm, the FDA announced its Final rule [Federal Register: May 9, 2002 (Volume 67, Number 90)] Certain Additional Over-the-Counter Drug Category II and III Active Ingredients. the stimulant laxative ingredients aloe (including aloe extract and aloe flower extract) and cascara sagrada (including casanthranol, cascara fluidextract aromatic, cascara sagrada bark, cascara sagrada extract, and cascara sagrada fluidextract), determining that they are not generally recognized as safe and effective or are misbranded. This final rule is part of FDA's ongoing OTC drug product review. This rule is\r\neffective November 5, 2002.Historically, the FDA has ruled against traditional generic drug products when the drug industry is ready to market a synthetic substitute product.In 2007, the FDA withdrew its approval for Zelnorm, but allowed it to be licensed as an Investigational New Drug.On April 2, 2008, after more than eight months of availability, the company has re-assessed the program and has made a decision to close it. Novartis is in the process of communicating this decision to physicians participating in the program. Patients who had access to Zelnorm via this program are instructed to discuss alternative treatment options with their physicians.Cascara and aloe are not among the treatment options approved by the FDA, so cascara isnt widely available (though anyone can grow aloe plants easily). However, there is considerable interest in the drug industry in the possibility\r\nof developing products based on emodin, or aloe-emodin, as anticancer or antiviral drugs. Even if it were proved to be safe and effective for use as a laxative, its potential use as an alternative to extremely profitable cancer and virus treatments would make it a serious threat to the drug industry.Although the standard medical journals have only recently begun writing about it as a cancer treatment, emodin and related chemicals have been of interest as a non-toxic way to treat cancer, allergies, and viral and bacterial diseases for a long time.In 1900, Moses Gomberg demonstrated the synthesis of a stable free radical (triphenylmethyl), but for years many chemists believed free radicals couldnt exist. A student of Gombergs, William F. Koch, came to believe that cellular respiration involved free radicals, and experimented with the metabolic effects of many organic molecules, quinones of several kinds, that can\r\nform free radicals, looking for the most useful ones.For more than 50 years the U.S. Government and the main medical instititutions actively fought the idea that a free radical or quinone could serve as a biological catalyst to correct a wide variety of health problems.A free radical has an unpaired electron. In 1944 Yevgeniy Zavoisky devised a way to measure the behavior of unpaired electrons in crystals, but it was many years before it was recognized that they are essential to cellular respiration. Alex Comfort demonstrated them in living tissue in 1959.By the time coenzyme Q10, ubiquinone, was officially discovered, Koch had moved to Brazil to continue his work with the biological effects of the quinones, including the anthraquinone compound of brazilwood, which is used as a dye. He also used a naphthoquine, lapachon Although vitamin K was identified\r\nas a quinone (naphthoquinone) not long after coQ10was found to be a ubiquitous component of the mitochondrial respiratory system, it wasnt immediately recognized as another participant in that system, interacting with coQ10.Although Koch was unable to publish in any English language medical journal after 1914, his work was widely known. In the 1930s, Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, following Kochs ideas about electrons in cells, interacting with free radicals, began working on the links between electronic energy and cellular movement. Since free (or relatively free) electrons absorb light, Szent-Gyorgyi worked with many colorful substances. When he came to the US in 1947, and wanted to expand his research, a team of professors from Harvard investigated, and told the government funding agency that his work didnt deserve support. For the rest of his life, he worked on\r\nrelated ideas, expanding ideas that Koch had first developed.Emodin and the anthraquinones (and naphthoquinones, such as lapachone) werent the reagents that Koch considered the most powerful, but emodin can produce to some degree all of the effects that he believed could be achieved by correcting the cellular respiratory apparatus:Antiinflammatory, antifibrotic (Wang, et al., 2007) antiviral, antidepressant, heart protective, antioxidant, memory enhancing, anticancer, anxiolytic and possibly antipsychotic.Working backward from these effects, we get a better perspective on the laxative function of emodin and cascara. Koch and Szent-Gyorgyi believed that cellular movement and secretion were electronically regulated. In one of his demonstrations, Szent-Gyorgyi showed that muscles could be caused to contract when they were exposed to two substances which, when combined, partially exchange an electron,\r\ncausing an intense color reaction, but without causing an ordinary chemical (oxidation-reduction) reaction. This kind of reaction is called a Donor-Acceptor reaction, and it is closely related to the phenomenon of semiconduction. The reacting molecules have to be exactly tuned to each other, allowing an electron to resonate between the molecules.In a muscle, any D-A matched pair of molecules would cause a contraction, but the same molecules, combined in pairs that werent exactly tuned to each other, failed to cause contraction. Szent-Gyorgyi believed that biological signal substances operated in a similar way, by adjusting the electronic balance of cellular proteins.An effective laxative (besides preventing inflammation) causes not only coordinated contraction of the smooth muscles of the intestine, but also adjusts secretions and absorption, so that an appropriate amount of fluid stays in the intestine, and\r\nthe cells of the intestine dont become water-logged.In the presence of bacterial endotoxin, respiratory energy production fails in the cells lining the intestine. Nitric oxide is probably the main mediator of this effect.The shift from respiration to glycolysis, from producing carbon dioxide to producing lactic acid, involves a global change in cell functions, away from specialized differentiated functioning, toward defensive and inflammatory processes.This global change involves a change in the physical properties of the cytoplasm, causing a tendency to swell, and to admit dissolved substances that normally wouldnt enter the cells.The interface between the cells lining the intestine and the bacteria-rich environment involves processes similar to those in cells at other interfacial situations throughout the body--kidney, bladder, secretory membranes of glands, capillary cells, etc. The failure of the\r\nintestinal barrier is especially dangerous, because of the generalized toxic consequences, but the principles of maintaining and restoring it are general, and they have to do with the nature of life.Some leakage from the lumen of the intestine or the lumen of a blood vessel can occur between cells, but it is often claimed that the paracellular route accounts for all leakage. (Anthraquinones may inhibit paracellular leakage [Karbach & Wanitschke, 1984].) When a cell is inflamed or overstimulated or fatigued, its cytoplasmic contents leak out. In that state, its barrier function is weakened, and external material can leak in. This was demonstrated long ago by Nasonov, but the membrane doctrine is incompatible with the facts, so the paracellular route is claimed to explain leakage. Since the cells that form the barrier begin to form regulatory substances such as nitric oxide when they are exposed to endotoxin, it is\r\nclear that major metabolic and energetic changes coincide in the cell with the observed leakiness. Permeability varies with the nature of the substance, its oil and water solubility, and the direction of its movement, arguing clearly that it isnt a matter of mere holes between cells.Besides endotoxin, estrogen, vibrational injury, radiation, aging, cold, and hypoosmolarity, increase NO synthesis and release, and increase cellular permeabilities throughout the body.Estrogen excess (relative to progesterone and androgens), as in pregnancy, stress, and aging, reduces intestinal motility, probably by increasing nitric oxide production. The anthraquinones inhibit the formation of nitric oxide, which is constantly being promoted by endotoxin.Cells regulate their water content holistically, and, to a great extent, autonomously, by adjusting their structural proteins and their metabolism, but in the process they\r\ncommunicate with surrounding cells and with the organism as a whole, and consequently they will receive various materials needed to improve their stability, by adjusting their energy production, sensitivity, and structural composition.When these intrinsic corrective processes are inadequate, as in hypothyroidism, with increased estrogen and serotonin, extrinsic factors, including special foods and drugs, can reinforce the adaptive mechanisms. These adaptogens can sometimes restore the system to perfect functioning, other times they can merely prevent further injury. Sometimes the adaptogens are exactly like those the body normally has, but that are needed in larger amounts during stress. Coenzyme Q10, vitamin K, short-chain fatty acids, ketoacids, niacinamide, and glycine are examples of this sort--they are always present, but increased amounts can improve resistance to\r\nstress.Another kind of adaptogen resembles the bodys intrinsic defensive substances, but isnt produced in significant quantities in our bodies. This type includes caffeine and the anthraquinones (such as emodin) and aspirin and other protective substances from plants. These overlap in functions with some of our intrinsic regulatory substances, and can also complement each others effects.Emodin inhibits the formation of nitric oxide, increases mitochondrial respiration, inhibits angiogenesis and invasiveness, inhibits fatty acid synthase (Zhang, et al., 2002), inhibits HER-2 neu and tyrosine phosphorylases (Zhang, et al., 1995, 1999), and promotes cellular differentiation in cancer cells (Zhang, et al., 1995). The anthraquinones, like other antiinflammatory substances, reduce leakage from blood vessels, but they also reduce the absorption of water from the intestine. Reduced water absorption can be seen in a\r\nslight shrinkage of cells in certain circumsstances, and is probably related to their promotion of cellular differentiation.All of these are basic antistress mechanisms, suggesting that emodin and the antiinflammatory anthraquinones are providing something central to the life process itself.Zelnorm was said to act like serotonin. Serotonin slows metabolism, reduces oxygen consumption, and increases free radicals such as superoxide and nitric oxide;the production of reactive oxygen species is probably an essential part of its normal function. Emodin has an opposing effect, increasing the metabolic rate. It increases mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis, while decreasing oxidative damage (Du and Ko, 2005, 2006; Huang, et al., 1995).The Zelnorm episode was just an isolated case of a drug companys exploiting cultural beliefs, with the FDA providing a defensive framework,\r\nbut the contrast between tegaserod and emodin hints at a deeper and more deadly problem.W.F. Kochs approach to immunity emphasized the role of energy in maintaining the coherence of the organism, in which toxins were oxidized and made nontoxic. There was no emphasis on destruction either of bacteria or of cancer cells, but only of the toxic factors that interfered with respiration. He demonstrated that the udders of healthy cows could contain more bacteria than those with mastitis, but the bacterial toxins were absent after the cows were treated with his catalyst. He identified the activated carbonyl group as the essential feature of antibiotics, the same group that makes coenzyme Q10function in the respiratory system.Kochs understanding of the oxidative apparatus of life, as a matter of electron balances, involved the idea that molecules with a low ionization\r\npotential, making them good electron donors, amines specifically, interfered with respiration, while quinones, with a high affinity for electrons, making them electron acceptors, activated respiration. The toxic effects of tryptophan derivatives, indoles, and other amines related to the behavior of their electrons. (Serotonin wasnt known at the time Koch was doing his basic research.) Koch believed that similar electronic functions were responsible for the effects of viruses.Both chemical and physical interactions of substances cause electrons to shift in each substance, according to its composition. The shift of electrons accounts for the ability of adsorbed molecules or ions to form multiple layers on a surface, and changes in the electrons of a complex biological molecule affect the shape and function not only of that molecule, but of the molecules associated with it. Interactions of the large molecules of cells, and their adsorbed\r\nsubstances, tend toward stable arrangements, or phases. The type of energy production, and the nature of the regulatory molecules that are present, influence the stability of the various states of an organisms cells. (For more information on cooperative adsorption, seewww.gilbertling.org.)Koch and Szent-Gyorgyi were applying to biology and medicine concepts that were simultaneously being developed in metallurgy, electrochemistry, colloid and surface science, and electronics. They were in the scientific mainstream, and it was the medical-pharmaceutical industry that moved away from this kind of exploration of the interactions of substances, electrons, and organisms.For Koch, antibiotics and anticancer agents werent necessarily distinct from each other, and would be expected to have other beneficial effects as well.But an entirely different view of the immune system was taking over the medical culture\r\njust as Koch began his research. Mechnikovs morphogenic view, in which the essential function of the immune system was to maintain the integrity of the organism, was submerged by Ehrlichs approach, which emphasized killing pathogens, and at the same time, the genetic theory of cancer was replacing the developmental-environmental theory.Following the early work on the carcinogenicity of estrogens, and the estrogenicity of carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from soot, a few German and French chemists (e.g., Schmidt and the Pullmans) began calculating the high electron densities of highly reactive regions of the anthracene molecule, showing formally why certain molecules are carcinogenic.At that time, their work was compatible with a developmental view of cancer. But the fact that the polycyclic molecules could interact with the new model of the DNA gene caused the Pullmans work to\r\nbe reduced to nothing but a minor theory of mutagenesis.Anthraquinones, because of the presence of several oxygen molecules, had low electron densities and were stable. The tetracyclines, with related structure, have some similar properties, and are antiinflammatory, as well as antibiotic.When a polycyclic bacterial antibiotic, adriamycyn (later called doxorubicin), was found to be too toxic to use as an antibiotic, the fact that it was toxic to cancer cells caused it to be developed as a cancer drug. It continued to be widely used even after it was found to cause heart failure in many of the cured patients, because of its success in killing cancer cells.The fact that many kinds of cancer cells can be killed by emodin makes it slightly interesting as a cancer drug, but its simple generic nature has caused the drug industry to look for a more Ehrlichian magic bullet; for example, they are\r\nstill looking for ways to keep doxorubicin from destroying the heart.Emodin isnt a magic bullet (in fact it isnt a bullet/toxin of any sort), but when combined with all the other adaptogens, it does have a place in cancer therapy, as well as in treating many other ailments.None of the basic metaphors of mainstream medicine--receptors, lock-and-key, membrane pores and pumps--can account for the laxative, anticancer, cell-protective effects of emodin. The new interest in it provides an opportunity to continue to investigate the effects of adjusting the electrical state of the cell substance, building on the foundations created by William F. Koch, Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, and Gilbert Ling.REFERENCESOncogene. 2005 Aug 11;24(34):5389-95.FAS expression inversely correlates with PTEN level in prostate cancer and a PI 3-kinase inhibitor synergizes with FAS siRNA to induce apoptosis.Bandyopadhyay S, Pai SK, Watabe M, Gross SC, Hirota S, Hosobe S, Tsukada T, Miura K, Saito K, Markwell SJ, Wang Y, Huggenvik J, Pauza ME, Iiizumi M, Watabe K.Nanomedicine. 2009 Mar;5(1):30-41.

        "chunk_html": "Osteoporosis, aging, tissue renewal, and product scienceThe incidence of osteoporosis, like\r\nobesity, has been increasing in recent decades. The number of hip fractures in many countries has doubled in the last 30 or 40 years (Bergstrom, et al., 2009). An exception to that trend was Australia in the period between 2001 and 2006, where the annual incidence of hip fractures in women over 60 years old decreased by 28.3%. During those years, the number of prescriptions for \"hormone replacement therapy\" decreased by 54.6%, and the number of prescriptions for bisphosphonate increased by 245%. The publication of the Women's Health Initiative results in 2002 (showing that the Prem-Pro treatment caused breast cancer, heart attacks, and dementia), led to a great decrease in the use of estrogen treatments everywhere.After the FDA approved estrogen's use in 1972 for the prevention of osteoporosis the number of women using it increased greatly, and by 1994, 44% of women in the US had used it. After the WHI results were published, the number of\r\nprescriptions for \"HRT\" fell by more than half, and following that decrease in estrogen sales, the incidence of breast cancer decreased by 9% in women between the ages of 50 and 54.With the incidence of hip fractures increasing while the percentage of women using estrogen was increasing, it seems likely that there is something wrong with the theory that osteoporosis is caused by an estrogen deficiency. That theory was derived from the theory that menopause was the consequence of ovarian failure, resulting from the failure to ovulate and produce estrogen when the supply of eggs was depleted. The theory was never more than an ideological preference, but the estrogen industry saw it as an opportunity to create a huge market.There are many studies that seem to imply that the greater incidence of osteoporotic fractures among women is the result of their exposure to estrogen during their reproductive years. This would be analogous to the understanding\r\nthat it is the cumulative exposure to estrogen that ages the nerves in the hypothalamus that control the cyclic release of the gonadotropic hormones, causing the menopause.. . . the nature of science itself changed around the middle of the last century, becoming product and disease oriented, so that now relatively few people are continuing to study bones objectively.Animal studies show that estrogen stunts growth, including bone growth. The high estrogen levels in girls' teen years and early twenties accounts for the fact that women's bones are lighter than men's. In rat studies, treatment with estrogen was found to enlarge the space between the jawbone and the teeth, which is a factor in periodontal disease (Elzay, 1964). Teeth are very similar to bones, so it's interesting that treating male or female rats with estrogen increases their incidence of tooth decay, and removing their gonads was found to decrease the incidence (Muhler and\r\nShafer, 1952). Supplementing them with thyroid hormone decreased the incidence of cavities in both males and females (Bixler, et al., 1957).One of the \"estrogen receptors\" appears to actively contribute to bone loss (Windahl, et al., 1999, 2001). Studies in dogs following the removal of their ovaries found that there was an increase of bone remodeling and bone formation rate in the first month, followed by a few months of slowed bone formation, but that by 10 months after the surgery the bones had returned to their normal remodeling rate, and that \"at no time was a significant reduction in bone volume detected\" (Boyce, et al., 1990). With the removal of the ovaries, the production of progesterone as well as estrogen is affected, but the adrenal glands and other tissues can produce those hormones.Until the influence of the estrogen industry overwhelmed it, ordinary science was studying bone development in comprehensive ways, understanding its\r\nbiological roles and the influences of the environment on it. But the nature of science itself changed around the middle of the last century, becoming product and disease oriented, so that now relatively few people are continuing to study bones objectively.The outstanding physical-chemical property of bone is that it is a reservoir-buffer of carbon dioxide, able to bind huge amounts of the gas into its structure.When carbon dioxide increases in the bloodstream it is at first absorbed rapidly by the bones, and if the blood level of CO2 is kept high day after day, the rate of absorption gradually slows down, but in experiments that have continued for several weeks the bones were still slowly absorbing more carbon dioxide; the absorption curve seems to be asymptotic. When people move to or from high altitudes, their bones appear to continue adapting to the different gas pressures for years. A reduction of atmospheric pressure (which allows the\r\ntissues to retain more carbon dioxide) helps to reduce the calcium loss caused by immobility (Litovka and Berezovs'ka, 2003; Berezovs'kyi, et al., 2000), and promotes the healing of damaged bone (Bouletreau, et al., 2002). Ultrasound treatment, which accelerates bone healing, stimulates processes similar to reduced oxygen supply (Tang, et al., 2007).The mineral in newly formed bone is calcium carbonate, and this is gradually changed to include a large amount of calcium phosphate. Besides forming part of the mineral, carbon dioxide is also incorporated into a protein (in a process requiring vitamin K), in a process that causes this protein, osteocalcin, to bind calcium. The osteocalcin protein is firmly bonded to a collagen molecule. Collagen forms about 30% of the mass of bone; several percent of the bone consists of other organic molecules, including osteocalcin, and the rest of the mass of the bone consists of mineral.Thyroid hormone is\r\nessential for forming carbon dioxide. In the early 1940s, experimental rabbits were fed their standard diet, with the addition of 1% desiccated thyroid gland, which would be equivalent to about 150 grains of Armour thyroid for a person. They became extremely hypermetabolic, and couldn't eat enough to meet their nutritional needs for growth and tissue maintenance. When they died, all of their tissues weighed much less than those of animals that hadn't received the toxic dose of thyroid, except for their bones, which were larger than normal. Experiments with the thin skull bones of mice have shown that the active thyroid hormone, T3, increases the formation of bone. To increase cellular respiration and carbon dioxide production, T3 increases the activity of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase, which uses copper as a co-factor. Increased thyroid activity increases the absorption of copper from foods.There is an inherited condition in humans, called\r\nosteopetrosis or marble bone disease, caused by lack of a carbonic anhydrase enzyme, which causes them to retain a very high level of carbon dioxide in their tissues. Using a chemical that inhibits carbonic anhydrase, such as the diuretic acetazolamide, a similar condition can be produced in animals. Acetazolamide inhibits the bone resorbing actions of parathyroid hormone, including lactic acid formation and the release of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase (Hall and Kenny, 1987).While lactic acidosis causes bone loss, acidosis caused by increased carbonic acid doesn't; low bicarbonate in the body fluids seems to remove carbonate from the bone (Bushinsky, et al., 1993), and also mineral phosphates (Bushinsky, et al., 2003). The parathyroid hormone, which removes calcium from bone, causes lactic acid to be formed by bone cells (Nijweide, et al., 1981; Lafeber, et al., 1986). Lactic acid produced by intense exercise causes calcium loss\r\nfrom bone (Ashizawa, et al., 1997), and sodium bicarbonate increases calcium retention by bone. Vitamin K2 (Yamaguchi, et al., 2003) blocks the removal of calcium from bone caused by parathyroid hormone and prostaglandin E2, by completely blocking their stimulation of lactic acid production by bone tissues. Aspirin, which, like vitamin K, supports cell respiration and inhibits lactic acid formation, also favors bone calcification. Vitamin K2 stimulates the formation of two important bone proteins, osteocalcin and osteonectin (Bunyaratavej, et al., 2009), and reduces the activity of estrogen by oxidizing estradiol (Otsuka, et al, 2005).The formation of eggshell, which is mostly calcium carbonate, is analogous to the early stage of bone formation. In hot weather, when chickens pant and lower their carbon dioxide, they form thin shells. A sodium bicarbonate supplement improves the quality of the eggshell (Balnave and Muheereza, 1997; Makled and\r\nCharles, 1987). Chickens that habitually lay eggs with thinner shells have lower blood bicarbonate than those that lay thick shelled eggs (Wideman and Buss, 1985).One of the arguments for stopping the sale of DDT in the US was that it was threatening to cause extinction of various species of bird because it caused them to lay eggs with very weak shells. Several other synthetic estrogenic substances, ethynylestradiol, lindane, PCBs, cause eggshell thinning, partly by altering carbonic anhydrase activity (Holm, et al, 2006). Estrogen and serotonin activate carbonic anhydrase in some tissues, progesterone tends to inhibit it. DDE, a metabolite of DDT, reduces medullary bone formation in birds (Oestricher, et al., 1971) and bone mineral density in men (Glynn, et al., 2000). Among its estrogenic effects, DDE increases prolactin (Watson, et al., 2007); one form of DDT inhibits progesterone synthesis and increases estrogen (Wojtowics, et al.,\r\n2007)In youth, the mineralization of the collagen framework is slightly lower than in maturity, and the bones are more flexible. With aging, the mineralization increases progressively, and the proportion of collagen decreases slightly, and the bones become increasingly brittle. (Rogers, et al., 1952; Mbuyi-Muamba, et al., 1987).Collagen is a major part of the extracellular substance everywhere in the body, and its concentration increases with aging in the non-calcified tissues. There is considerable renewal and modification of collagen, as new molecules are formed and old molecules broken down, but its average structure changes with aging, becomes less soluble and more rigid, as the result of chemical cross-links formed between molecules. These cross-links are involved in regulating the differentiation of bone cells (Turecek, et al., 2008). Recently (August 2, 2011), Deasey et al., have published evidence showing that\r\ncross-linking is required for bone mineralization (2011).The outstanding physical-chemical property of bone is that it is a reservoir-buffer of carbon dioxide, able to bind huge amounts of the gas into its structure.Around 1950, Fritz Verzar began studying the changes of collagen that occur with aging, and his work led to the \"collagen theory of aging.\" He showed that older, stiffer, less elastic tendons have a higher \"melting\" or contracting temperature than young tendons. (This effect is responsible for the curling of a piece of meat when it is frying.)Verzar and his colleagues investigated the effects of hormonal treatments on the aging of rat collagen, especially in their tail tendons. They found that estrogen treatment increased the stiffness and the melting temperature of collagenous tissues. While estrogen increased the cross-linking with aging, removing the pituitary gland was found to retard the\r\naging.Later, the cross-linking enzymes transglutaminase and lysyl oxidase, which are induced by estrogen, were found to be a major factor in the cross-linking of collagen and other molecules.When estrogen was found to age the connective tissues, it was assumed that continual breeding during an animal's life-time, greatly increasing the total exposure of the tissues to estrogen, would increase the aged rigidity of the connective tissues, but these animals were found to have less rigid tissues. During pregnancy other hormones, especially progesterone, were also increased, and it was suggested that this reversed the effects of aging and estrogen. Since most people had believed that frequent pregnancies would cause a woman to age more rapidly, a large survey of records was done, to compare the longevity of women with the number of pregnancies. It was found, in the very extensive Hungarian records, that life-span was increased in proportion to\r\nthe number of pregnancies.Despite these very interesting results in the 1950s and 1960s, the growing influence of the estrogen industry changed the direction of aging research, favoring the belief that decreasing estrogen accelerated the deterioration of tissues in aging, and the popularity of Denham Harman's \"free radical theory of aging\" led many people to assume that random reactions produced by lipid peroxidation were responsible for most of the cross-linking, and that theory was gradually replaced by the \"glycation\" theory of aging, in which sugar molecules break down and form the cross-links, by random, non-enzymic processes. Estrogen's role in aging was completely by-passed.The meat industry is interested in reducing the toughness of meat, by influencing the nature of the collagen in muscle. Castrated animals were found to produce meat that was tenderer than that of intact males. When castrated animals were treated with testosterone, the\r\namount of collagen was increased, making the meat tougher. But when dihydrotestoserone, which can't be converted to estrogen was used, the meat didn't become tough. Treatment with estrogen produced the same increase of collagen as treatment with testosterone, showing that testosterone's effect was mainly the result of its conversion to estrogen (Miller, et al., 1990).In the 1960s and '70s the estrogen industry was looking for ways to build on the knowledge that in puberty estrogen is responsible for accelerating the calcification of the growth plate at the ends of the long bones, and to find a rationale for selling estrogen to all women concerned with the problems of aging.  As bone metabolism was investigated, two kinds of cell were found to be active in constantly remodeling the bone structure: Osteoclasts (breaking it down), and osteoblasts (building new bone). Estrogen was found to slow the actions of the osteoclasts, so the idea that it\r\nwould delay osteoporosis became the basis for a huge new marketing campaign. Slowing bone metabolism became the focus. Although estrogen was known to increase prolactin, and prolactin was known to accelerate bone loss, nearly all publications began to focus on substances in the blood or urine that corresponded to the rate of bone turnover, with the implication that increasing bone turnover would correspond to a net loss of bone.This was the context in which, during the 1980s, articles about thyroxine's role in causing osteoporosis began to appear. The thyroid hormone supports bone renewal, and increases indicators of bone breakdown in the blood and urine. If estrogen's use was to be justified by slowing bone turnover, then the effects of thyroid, accelerating bone turnover, should be interpreted as evidence of bone destruction.A basic problem with many of the publications on thyroid and bone loss was that they were talking about an\r\nunphysiological medical practice (prescribing the pre-hormone, thyroxine), which frequently failed to improve thyroid function, and could even make it worse, by lowering the amount of T3 in the tissues.Later, it was noticed that high TSH was associated with the signs of lower bone turnover. TSH rises when there is less thyroid hormone, but (after the recombinant TSH became available for medical use) a few publications argued that it was the TSH itself, rather than the absence of thyroid hormone, that was \"protecting\" the bones (lowering the evidence of bone turnover). The doctrine that had been developed to support estrogen therapy was now used to oppose thyroid therapy. Keeping the TSH high would slow bone turnover.Working in this cultural context, genetic engineers at Amgen identified a protein that inhibited the formation of osteoclast cells, and slowed bone metabolism. It was suggested that it was responsible for estrogen's suppression\r\nof the osteoclasts, and many publications appeared showing that it was increased by estrogen. It was named \"osteoprotegerin,\" meaning \"the bone protecting protein.\"  Prolactin increases osteoprotegerin (OPG), reducing bone resorption just as estrogen does. Serotonin also increases OPG, and it turns out that OPG is elevated in all of the pathological conditions associated with high serotonin, including cancer, pulmonary artery hypertension, vascular calcification, and even bone loss.While Arthur Everitt, Verzar, and others were studying the effects of the rat's pituitary (and other glands) on collagen, W. D. Denckla investigated the effects of reproductive hormones and pituitary removal in a wide variety of animals, including fish and mollusks. He had noticed that reproduction in various species (e.g., salmon) was quickly followed by rapid aging and death. Removing the pituitary gland (or its equivalent) and providing thyroid hormone, he found\r\nthat animals lacking the pituitary lived much longer than intact animals, and maintained a high metabolic rate. Making extracts of pituitary glands, he found a fraction (closely related to prolactin and growth hormone) that suppressed tissue oxygen consumption, and accelerated the degenerative changes of aging.Aging, estrogen, cortisol, and a variety of stresses, including radiation and lipid peroxidation, chemically alter collagen, producing cross-links that increase its rigidity, and affect the way it binds minerals. The cross-linking enzymes induced by estrogen are involved in the normal maturation of bone collagen, and at puberty when estrogen increases, bone growth is slowed, as the cross-linking and mineralization are accelerated. With aging and the accumulation of heavy metals and polyunsaturated fats, random oxidative processes increase the cross-linking. In bones, the relatively large masses of cartilage absorb oxygen and nutrients slowly,\r\nso internally the amount of oxygen is very limited, about 1/5 as much as at the surface, and this low oxygen tension is an important factor in regulating growth, differentiation, cross-linking, and calcification, maintaining bone integrity. But in blood vessels the connective tissues are abundantly supplied with oxygen and nutrients; this is normally a factor regulating the production of collagen and its cross-linking, and preventing calcification.When the factors promoting collagen synthesis and maturation are increased systemically, with aging and stress, the excess cross-linking slows the biological renewal process in bones, but in blood vessels the same processes creating excess cross-linking initiate a calcification process, involving the various factors that in youth are responsible for normal maturation of bone.Prolactin, like estrogen, interferes with thyroid function and oxygen consumption (Wade, et al., 1986; Strizhkov, 1991;\r\nSpatling, et al., 1982). Many years ago, repeated lactation was considered to cause osteoporosis and loss of teeth, and prolactin, which mobilizes calcium from bones for the production of milk, was recognized as an important factor in bone loss. Drugs that increase prolactin were found to cause osteoporosis. In the 40 years since the drug industry began its intense promotion of estrogen to prevent and treat osteoporosis, there has been very little attention to the fact that estrogen increases prolactin, which contributes to osteoporosis, but some people (e.g., Horner, 2009) have noticed that oral contraceptives and menopausal hormone treatments have damaged the bones of the inner ear, causing otosclerosis and impaired hearing, and have suggested that prolactin mediates the effect.A few years ago, the \"serotonin reuptake inhibitor\" antidepressants, already known to increase prolactin by increasing the effects of serotonin, were found to be causing\r\nosteoporosis after prolonged use.  Estrogen increases serotonin, which besides promoting the secretion of prolactin, also stimulates the production of parathyroid hormone and cortisol, both of which remove calcium from bone, and contribute to the calcification of blood vessels. The association between weakened bones and hardened arteries is now widely recognized, but researchers are being careful to avoid investigating any mechanisms that could affect sales of important drug products, especially estrogen and antidepressants.Following the recognition that the SSRI drugs were causing osteoporosis, it was discovered that the serotonin produced in the intestine causes bone loss, and that inhibiting intestinal serotonin synthesis would stop bone loss and produce a bone building anabolic effect (Inose, et al., 2011). One group that had been concentrating on the interactions of genes commented that, recognizing the effects of intestinal serotonin,\r\nthey had suddenly become aware of \"whole organism physiology\" (Karsenty and Gershon, 2011).In previous newsletters I have talked about the ability of intestinal irritation and the associated increase of serotonin to cause headaches, asthma, coughing, heart and blood vessel disease, muscular dystrophy, flu-like symptoms, arthritis, inflammation of muscles and nerves, depression, and inflammatory brain diseases. With the new recognition that serotonin is a basic cause of osteoporosis, intestinal health becomes a major issue in aging research.The protein that inhibits intestinal formation of serotonin is the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. This seems likely to have something to do with the fact that \"low\" HDL is associated with better bones. A low level of LDL is associated with increased vertebral fractures (Kaji, et al., 2010).Cartilage synthesis and turnover are highest at night. It is inhibited by metabolic acidosis\r\n(increased lactic acid), but not by respiratory acidosis (CO2) (Bushinsky, 1995). Since most calcium is lost from bone during the night (Eastell, et al., 1992; even in children: DeSanto, et al., 1988) in association with the nocturnal rise of the catabolic substances, such as free fatty acids, cortisol, prolactin, PTH, and adrenalin, things which minimize the nocturnal stress can decrease the bone turnover. These include calcium (Blumsohn, et al., 1994) and sugar. Catabolic substances and processes increase with aging, especially at night.  Babies grow most during the night when bone turnover is high, and even a daytime nap accelerates collagen turnover (Lutchman, et al., 1998).Discussions about whether a certain person's osteoporosis is \"menopausal osteoporosis\" or \"senile osteoporosis\" have neglected the possibility that osteoporosis doesn't begin in either menopause or old age, but that it is the result of life-long developmental\r\nprocesses that interact with all the factors that are involved in aging. The fact that the collagen content of old bone is lower than in young bone (as a percentage of bone weight) shows that the problem in osteoporosis isn't a lack of calcification, it's a deficiency of tissue renewal, parallel to sarcopenia, the decrease of muscle mass with aging. Systemically decreased tissue renewal would account for the association of bone loss with other processes such as male baldness (Morton, et al., 2007) and Alzheimer's disease (Zhou, et al., 2011, Duthie, et al., 2011).A high level of respiratory energy production that characterizes young life is needed for tissue renewal. The accumulation of factors that impair mitochondrial respiration leads to increasing production of stress factors, that are needed for survival when the organism isn't able to simply produce energetic new tissue as needed. Continually resorting to these substances progressively\r\nreshapes the organism, but the investment in short-term survival, without eliminating the problematic factors, tends to exacerbate the basic energy problem. This seems to be the reason that Denckla's animals, deprived of their pituitary glands, but provided with thyroid hormone, lived so long: they weren't able to mobilize the multiple defenses that reduce the mitochondria's respiratory energy production.Several things that the geneticists would never be able to fit into their schemes of \"bone regulatory molecules\" such as OPG, growth hormone, parathyroid hormone, and estrogen, fit neatly with the idea that bone health is maintained by respiratory energy and tissue renewal, under the influence of thyroid hormone. For example, adrenaline, which is increased by stress, aging, and hypothyroidism (and in many cases by estrogen), causes bone loss. Even the bone loss caused by immobility can be blocked by an adrenaline blocker such as propranolol.\r\n(The stress of immobility also famously increases serotonin.) Adrenaline tends to decrease carbon dioxide and increase lactic acid, and it strongly increases parathyroid hormone (Ljunhgall S, et al., 1984).Calcium activates mitochondrial respiration, and lowers adrenaline (Luft, et al., 1988), parathyroid hormone (Ohgitani, et al., 1997), and prolactin (Kruse and Kracht, 1981). Copper, which is the co-factor for the cytochrome C oxidase enzyme, activated by thyroid, is essential for bone formation and maintenance, and is consistently deficient in osteoporosis. Thyroid hormone increases the body's ability to assimilate copper.Aspirin, which stimulates bone formation, has other thyroid-like actions, including activation of mitochondrial respiration and energy production, with an increase of cytochrome C oxidase (Cai, et al., 1996), and it lowers serotonin (Shen, et al., 2011). It also apparently protects against calcification of the\r\nsoft tissues, (Vasudev, et al., 2000), though there has been surprisingly little investigation of that.  \"Aspirin can promote trabecular bone remodeling, improve three-dimensional structure of trabecular bone and increase bone density of cancellous in osteoporotic rats by stimulating bone formation. It may become a new drug for the treatment of osteoporosis\" (Chen, et al., 2011).A wide range of inflammatory mediators that accelerate inflammation and bone loss also inhibit thyroid function. People who ate more polyunsaturated fat, which inhibits thyroid and oxidative metabolism, were several times more likely to have osteoporotic fractures (that is, essentially spontaneous fractures) than people who ate the least (Martinez-Ramirez, et al., 2007).Arachidonic acid stimulates prolactin secretion, and prolactin acts on the thyroid gland to decrease its activity, and on other tissues to increase their glycolysis (with lactate production),\r\nwhile decreasing oxidative metabolism (Spatling, et al., 1982; Strizhkov, 1991).Living at high altitude, which strengthens bones, increases thyroid activity and decreases prolactin (Richalet, et al., 2010) and parathyroid hormone (Khan, et al., 1996). It lowers free fatty acids, which lower bone mass by reducing bone formation and increasing bone resorption (Chen, et al., 2010). In menopausal women, polyunsaturated fatty acids and even monounsaturated fats are associated with bone loss, fruit and vegetable consumption protects against bone loss (Macdonald, et al., 2004).While it's very interesting that the drug propranol which blocks adrenaline, and drugs that block serotonin formation, have bone protective and restorative effects, they also have undesirable side effects. Food choices that optimize oxidative metabolism are the safest, as well as the most economical, way to approach the problem of osteoporosis and other degenerative\r\nchanges. A person can easily perceive changes in appetite, quality of sleep, changes in skin, hair, and mood, etc., but blood tests could be used to confirm that the right choices were being made. Tests for vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, free fatty acids, and CO2/bicarbonate, as well as the hormones, can be helpful, if a person isn't sure whether their diet, sunlight exposure, and thyroid supplementation is adequate.The popular medical understanding of the organism is based on a mechanistic view of causality, in which genes have a central role, causing things to develop and function in certain ways, and that hormones and drugs can cause genes to increase or decrease their activity. Genes that build bones can be activated by one substance, and genes that tear down bones can be inhibited by another substance. The \"osteoprotegerin\" story illustrates the problem with that kind of thinking.Vernadsky's description of an organism as a\r\n\"whirlwind of atoms\" is probably a better way to think of how \"causality\" works. The moving air in a whirlwind forms a self-intensifying system, with the motion reducing the pressure, causing more air to be drawn into the system. The atoms moving in coordination aren't acting as separate things, but as parts in a larger thing. The way in which increased metabolism in the bones acts favorably on the metabolism of kidneys, blood vessels, lungs, liver, digestive system, etc., which in turn favors the bones' renewal, is analogous to the tendency of a whirlwind to intensify as long as there is a source of energy.The intensity of oxidative metabolism is the basic factor that permits continuing coordination of activity, and the harmonious renewal of all the components of the organism.REFERENCESAnn Nutr Aliment. 1975;29(4):305-12.[Effects of administering diets with starch or sucrose basis on certain parameters of calcium metabolism in the young, growing rat].Artus M.

        "chunk_html": "Regeneration and degeneration:Types of inflammation change with agingFor about 100 years it has been popular to explain the degenerative diseases as the result of mutations in the genes, a slow accumulation of somatic mutations, as opposed to the germ cell mutations that are involved in Huntingtons chorea and sickle cell anemia. Some people explained all the changes of aging on the same basis, but 50 years ago, the somatic mutation theory of aging was clearly shown to be false. The gene-mutation theory of cancer is more persistent, but the work of people like Harry Rubin has made it clear that functional changes in cells that are becoming cancerous destabilize the chromosomes and cause defects to appear in the genes, rather than the reverse.Older ways of\r\nunderstanding aging and degenerative disease are now returning to the foreground. The developmental interactions of the organism with its environment, and the interactions of its cells, tissues, and organs with each other, have again become the focus of biological aging research. In place of the old belief that we are defined and limited by our genes, the new perspective is showing us that we are limited by our environment, and that our environment can be modified. As we react to unsuitable environments, our internal environments become limiting for our cells, and instead of renewing themselves, repairing damage, and preparing for new challenges, our cells find themselves in blind alleys. Looking at aging in this way suggests that putting ourselves into the right environments could prevent aging.A bird developing inside its eggshell illustrates the way organs and the environment interact. The chicken created a very good environment\r\nfor the early development of its young. When the egg is formed, it contains everything needed to produce a chicken, except for oxygen and a steady warm temperature. But before the chicks body has finished developing, using yolk fat for energy, the glucose contained in the egg has been consumed, and at that point the chicks brain stops growing. A researcher who knew that brain growth in other kinds of animals requires glucose, injected glucose (or glycine) into the developing eggs when the original glucose had been depleted. The supplemental glucose allowed the chicks brain to continue growing until it hatched. These chicks had larger brains, containing more numerous cells. The same experimenters also found that progesterone increases brain size, while corticosterone decreases it. Although the egg is a very good environment for the development of chickens, these experiments showed that it isnt the best that can be achieved. If the hens\r\nenvironment had been different, it might have been able to provide as much glucose and progesterone as the experimenters did.Mammals were able to develop bigger brains than birds, by gestating their offspring internally, allowing a continuous supply of nutrients, such as glucose, and hormones such as progesterone. But the environment of the mother still can profoundly affect the development of the offspring, by influencing her physiology.Another factor involved in developing a large brain is the metabolic rate, which is closely associated with the temperature. Birds have larger brains relative to their bodies than reptiles do, and birds maintain a consistently high body temperature, sometimes as high as 110 degrees F, while reptiles temperature varies somewhat according to the temperature of their surroundings and their level of activity. Amphibians have much lower metabolic rates, and are generally unable to live\r\nat the higher temperatures required by reptiles.The high metabolic rate of a bird, combined with its development inside an egg, means that compromises are made. The high rate of metabolism uses the stored energy rapidly, so the growth of the brain is limited. But their very high body temperature maximizes the effectiveness of that brain. Birds, such as owls, parrots, and crows, that hatch in a less developed, more dependent condition, are able to continue their brain growth, and have larger brains than other birds, such as chickens. In birds and mammals, longevity generally corresponds to brain size and metabolic rate. (For example, a pet crow, Tata, died at the age of 59 in 2006 in New York; parrots sometimes live more than 100 years.) These (altricious) birds are the opposite of precocious, they preserve embryonic or infantile traits into adulthood.For whole organisms or for single cells, development depends on the\r\nadequacy of the environment. Temperature and the quality of nourishment are important, and by thinking about the other special features of the growth processes during gestation, we might be able to find that some of the compromises that are customarily made in our more mature lives arent necessary.One way of looking at aging is that its a failure of regeneration or healing, related to changes in the nature of inflammation.In childhood, wounds heal quickly, and inflammation is quickly resolved; in extreme old age, or during extreme stress or starvation, wound healing is much slower, and the nature of the inflammation and wound closure is different. In the fetus, healing can be regenerative and scarless, for example allowing a cleft palate to be surgically corrected without scars (Weinzweig, et al., 2002).Fifty years ago, inflammation was seen as a necessary part of the healing process, but now it is\r\nrecognized as a cause of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and aging itself. During the development of the organism, the nature of healing changes, as the nature of inflammation changes. Early in life, healing is regenerative or restorative, and there is little inflammation. In adulthood as the amount of inflammation increases, healing fails to completely restore lost structures and functions, resulting in scarring, the replacement of functional tissue with fibrous tissue. Identifiable changes in the nature of inflammation under different conditions can explain some of these losses of healing capacity. Factors that limit inflammation and fibrosis, while permitting tissue remodeling, could facilitate regeneration and retard aging.Several cytokines (proteins that regulate cell functions) appear at much higher concentrations in adult tissues than in fetal tissues (PDGF A, three forms of TGF, IGF 1, and bFGF; Wagner, et al., 2007), and when\r\none of these (TGF-beta1) is added to the healing fetus, it produces inflammation and fibrosis (Lanning, et al., 1999). Two prostaglandins, PGE2 and PGF2a, potently produce inflammation in fetal rabbits, but not in adult rabbits. (Morykwas, et al., 1994).Tissue injury that would produce inflammation in adults causes other signals in the fetus that activate repair processes. When a cell is injured or stressed, for example when deprived of oxygen, it becomes incontinent, and releases ATP into its surroundings. The extracellular ATP, and its breakdown products, ADP, AMP, adenosine, and inorganic phosphate or pyrophosphate, stimulate cells in various ways. ATP causes vasodilation, increasing circulation, and usually signals cells to divide, and can activate stem cells (Yu, et al., 2010) The lactic acid produced by distressed cells also has signalling effects, including vasodilation and stimulated division. Stressed cells digest their own\r\nproteins and other structural materials (autophagy), and the breakdown products act as signals to guide the differentiation of their replacement cells. Mobile phagocytes, ingesting the material of decomposing cells, are essential for guiding tissue restoration.In adults, prostaglandins are known to be involved in many of the harmful effects of inflammation. They are formed from the polyunsaturated fats, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, which we are unable to synthesize ourselves, so the adults exposure to the prostaglandins is influence by diet. Since the fetus is able to synthesize fat from glucose, the newborn animal usually contains a high proportion of saturated fats and their derivatives, such as stearic acid, oleic acid, and Mead acid, which can be synthesized from glucose or amino acids. Newborn calves have very little polyunsaturated fat in their tissues, but even the small percentage of PUFA in milk causes its tissues\r\nto gradually accumulate a higher percentage of PUFA as it matures. The fatty acids of newborn humans, and other non-ruminants, reflect their mothers diets more closely, but Mead acid is still present in human newborns (Al, et al., 1990). In a study of prenatal learning (habituation rate), the experimenters found that the relative absence of the supposedly essential fatty acids improved the short term and long term memory of the fetus (Dirix, et al., 2009). The size of the baby was found to be negatively associated with the highly unsaturated fatty acids DHA and AA (Dirix, et al., 2009), showing a general growth-retarding effect of these environmentally derived fats.The embryo or fetus is enclosed in a germ-free environment, so it doesnt need an immune system in the ordinary sense, but it does contain phagocytes, which are an essential part of development, in the embryo, as well as in the adult (Bukovky, et al., 2000). They are\r\ninvolved in removing malignant cells, healing wounds, and remodeling tissues. In adults, the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA are known to be immunosuppressive, but in tests on monocytes from the umbilical cord blood of newborns, the highly unsaturated fatty acids kill the monocytes that are so important for proper development and regeneration (Sweeney, et al., 2001), and interfere with signals that govern their migration (Ferrante, et al., 1994). DHA is now being sold with many health claims, including the idea that adding it to baby formula will improve their eyesight and intelligence. As the consumption of PUFA has increased in the US and many other countries, the incidence of birth defects has increased. The formation of excessive amounts of prostaglandin, or killing macrophages, among other toxic effects, might be responsible for those visible anatomical changes during growth, as well as for the subtler loss of regenerative\r\ncapacity.In the adult, the PUFA and prostaglandins are known to increase collagen synthesis. Serotonin and estrogen, which interact closely with PUFA, promote collagen synthesis and fibrosis. In the fetus, hyaluronic acid, rather than collagen, is the main extracellular material in wound repair (Krummel, et al., 1987). Both it and its decomposition products have important regulatory signal functions in wound healing (Gao, et al., 2008), inflammation, and cell differentiation (Krasinski and Tchórzewski, 2007).Prostaglandins also inhibit local cell division (observed in the cornea, Staatz and Van Horn, 1980), shifting responsibility for tissue repair to mobile cells, for example stem cells from the blood. PUFA also interfere with the turnover of collagen by inhibiting proteolytic enzymes that are necessary for tissue remodeling. These are among the changes that characterize scar formation, rather than the\r\nscarless regeneration that can occur in the fetus. They also occur throughout the body with aging, as part of a progressive fibrosis.Besides minimizing dietary PUFA, other things are known that will reduce the fibrosis associated with injury, inflammation, or aging. Thyroid hormone, progesterone, and carbon dioxide all reduce inflammation while facilitating normal tissue remodeling. Fibrosis of the heart and liver, which are often considered to be unavoidably progressive, can be regressed by thyroid hormone, and various fibroses, including breast, liver, and mesentery, have been regressed by progesterone treatment.The thyroid hormone is necessary for liver regeneration, and the ability of the thyroid gland itself to regenerate might be related to the also great ability of the adrenal cortex to regenerate--the cells of these endocrine glands are frequently stimulated, even by intrinsic factors such as T3 in the thyroid, and\r\nseem to have an intrinsic stem-cell-like quality, turning-over frequently. Secretion of stimulating substances is probably one of the functions of macrophages in these glands (Ozbek & Ozbek, 2006) The failure to recognize the glands regenerative ability leads to many inappropriate medical treatments.The amount of disorganized fibrous material formed in injured tissue is variable, and it depends on the state of the individual, and on the particular situation of the tissue. For example, the membranes lining the mouth, and the bones and bone marrow, and the thymus gland are able to regenerate without scarring. What they have in common with each other is a relatively high ratio of carbon dioxide to oxygen. Salamanders, which are able to regenerate legs, jaw, spinal cord, retina and parts of the brain (Winklemann & Winklemann, 1970), spend most of their time under cover in burrows, which besides preventing drying of their\r\nmoist skin, keeps the ratio of carbon dioxide to oxygen fairly high.The regeneration of finger tips, including a well-formed nail if some of the base remained, will occur if the wounded end of the finger is kept enclosed, for example by putting a metal or plastic tube over the finger. The humidity keeps the wound from forming a dry scab, and the cells near the surface will consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide, keeping the ratio of carbon dioxide to oxygen much higher than in normal uninjured tissue.Carbon dioxide is being used increasingly to prevent inflammation and edema. For example, it can be used to prevent adhesions during abdominal surgery, and to protect the lungs during mechanical ventilation. It inhibits the formation of inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins (Peltekova, et al., 2010, Peng, et al., 2009, Persson & van den Linden, 2009), and reduces the leakiness of the intestine (Morisaki, et\r\nal., 2009).  Some experiments show that as it decreases the production of some inflammatory materials by macrophages (TNF: Lang, et al., 2005), including lactate, it causes macrophages to activate phagocytic neutrophils, and to increase their number and activity (Billert, et al., 2003, Baev & Kuprava, 1997).Factors that are associated with a decreased level of carbon dioxide, such as excess estrogen and lactate, promote fibrosis. Adaptation to living at high altitude, which is protective against degenerative disease, involves reduced lactate formation, and increased carbon dioxide. It has been suggested that keloid formation (over-growth of scar tissue) is less frequent at high altitudes (Ranganathan, 1961), though this hasnt been carefully studied. Putting an injured arm or leg into a bag of pure carbon dioxide reduces pain and accelerates healing.In aging, the removal of inactive cells becomes incomplete\r\n(Aprahamian, et al., 2008). It is this removal of cellular debris that is essential for regenerative healing to take place. Degenerating tissue stimulates the formation of new tissue, but this requires adequate cellular energy for phagocytosis, which requires proper thyroid function. Hyperthyroidism has been shown to accelerate the process (Lewin-Kowalik, et al., 2002). The active thyroid hormone, T3, stimulates the removal of inactive cells (Kurata, et al., 1980).Regenerative healing also requires freedom from substances that inhibit the digestion of the debris. The great decline in proteolytic autophagy that occurs with aging (Del Roso, et al., 2003) can be reduced by inhibiting the release of fatty acids. This effect is additive to the antiaging effects of calorie restriction, suggesting that it is largely the decrease of dietary fats that makes calorie restriction effective (Donati, et al., 2004,\r\n2008).Niacinamide is a nutrient that inhibits the release of fatty acids, and it also activates phagocytic activity and lowers phosphate. It protects against the development of scars in spinal cord injuries, facilitates recovery from traumatic brain injury, and accelerates healing generally. While it generally supports immunity, its protective against autoimmunity. It can cause tumor cells to either mature or disintegrate, but it prolongs the replicative life of cultured cells, and protects against excitotoxicity.The amounts needed seem large if niacinamide is thought of as vitamin B3, but it should be considered as a factor that compensates for our unphysiological exposure to inappropriate fats. Aspirin and vitamin E are other natural substances that are therapeutic in unnaturally large amounts because of our continual exposure to the highly unsaturated plant-derived n-3 and n-6\r\nfats.When animals are made deficient in the polyunsaturated fatty acids, their wounds heal, with normal or accelerated collagen synthesis, and with more vigorous collagen breakdown (Parnham, et al., 1977). Their blood vessels are more resistant, preventing shock that would otherwise be caused by many factors. All phases of development, from gestation to aging, are altered by the presence of the unsaturated fats, and these effects correspond closely to the loss of the regenerative capacity, the ability to replenish and restore tissues.If the very small amounts of polyunsaturated fats reaching the fetus can retard growth and brain development (Liu and Borgman, 1977; Borgman, et al., 1975) and function, it is apparently acting on some very important biological processes. The toxic effects of PUFA seen in the animal studies probably have their equivalent in humans, for example the association of childhood\r\nhyperactivity with a smaller brain. The incidence of the attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder is increasing in the US, somewhat faster among girls than boys (Robison, et al.,2002). In schizophrenic teenagers, the brain shrinks, suggesting an interaction of the hormones of puberty with environmental toxins or deficiencies. The progressive accumulation of much larger amounts of these fats later in life, especially after the rate of growth decreases, could be expected to cause even greater interference with those processes of development and function.All tissues age, but the brain might be the least ambiguous organ to consider. The aging brain often shrinks, and becomes more susceptible to excitotoxicity, which kills brain cells. Degenerative brain diseases, such as Huntingtons chorea and Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, have been compared to the dementia of pellagra, in which chorea and other excitatory processes are obvious. (Anti-glutamatergic\r\ndrugs are beginning to be used therapeutically, to restore some inhibitory balance in the degenerating brain.)Pellagra occurs about twice as often in women as in men, and this is because estrogen activates an enzyme that alters metabolism of tryptophan, blocking the formation of niacin. The alternative products include the excitotoxin, quinolinic acid, and some carcinogens.Progesterone inhibits the activity of that enzyme. Progesterone also lowers brain serotonin (Izquierdo, et al., 1978), decreases the excitatory carcinogens (Moursi, et al., 1970) and increases the formation of niacin (Shibata, et al., 2003) The polyunsaturated fats, DHA, EPA, and linoleic acid activate the conversion of tryptophan to quinolinic acid (Egashira, et al., 2003, 2004), and inhibit the formation of niacin (Egashira, et al., 1995).The normal pathway from tryptophan to niacin leads to formation of the coenzyme NAD,\r\nwhich is involved in a great variety of cellular processes, notably energy production, the maintenance of the cellular differentiated state by regulating gene expression, and the activity of phagocytes.Glucose and niacinamide work very closely with each other, and with the thyroid hormone, in the maintenance and repair of cells and tissues. When one of these energy-producing factors is lacking, the changes in cell functions -- a sort of pre-inflammatory state -- activate corrective processes. Energy depletion itself is an excitatory state, that calls for increased fuel and oxygen. But when cells are exposed to PUFA, their ability to use glucose is blocked, increasing their exposure to the fats. Saturated fats activate the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme that is essential for the efficient use of glucose, while PUFA block it. (The MRL mouse strain has a high regenerative ability, associated with a retained tendency to metabolize glucose rather\r\nthan fatty acids.) The negative energetic effects of PUFA include interfering with thyroid and progesterone. The energy resources are suppressed, at the same time that the inflammatory signals are amplified, and many regulatory pathways (including the replenishment of NAD from tryptophan) are diverted.In the fetus, especially before the fats from the mothers diet begin to accumulate, signals from injured tissue produce the changes that lead quickly to repair of the damage, but during subsequent life, similar signals produce incomplete repairs, and as they are ineffective they tend to be intensified and repeated, and eventually the faulty repair processes become the main problem. Although this is an ecological problem, it is possible to decrease the damage by avoiding the polyunsaturated fats and the many toxins that synergize with them, while increasing glucose, niacinamide, carbon dioxide, and other factors that support high energy\r\nmetabolism, including adequate exposure to long wavelength light and avoidance of harmful radiation. As long as the toxic factors are present, increased amounts of protective factors such as progesterone, thyroid, sugar, niacinamide, and carbon dioxide can be used therapeutically and preventively.REFERENCESEur J Med Res. 2003 Aug 20;8(8):381-7.Dietary fatty acids and immune reactions in synovial tissue.Adam O.Early Hum Dev. 1990 Dec;24(3):239-48.Biochemical EFA status of mothers and their neonates after normal pregnancy.Al MD, Hornstra G, van der Schouw YT, Bulstra-Ramakers MT, Huisjes HJ.Clin Exp Immunol. 2008 Jun;152(3):448-55.

Hepatic alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD; formerly termed picolinic carboxylase) [EC4.1.1.45] plays a key role in regulating NAD biosynthesis and the generation of quinolinate (quinolinic acid) from tryptophan. Quinolinate is a potent endogenous excitotoxin of neuronal cells. We previously reported that ingestion of fatty acids by rats leads to a decrease in their hepatic ACMSD activity. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon is not clarified. We previously purified ACMSD and cloned cDNA encoding rat ACMSD. Therefore, in\r\nthis study, we examined the differential effect of fatty acids on ACMSD mRNA expression by Northern blot. Moreover, we measured quinolinic acid concentration in rats fed on fatty acid. When diets containing 2% level of fatty acid were given to male Sprague-Dawley rats (4 weeks old) for 8 days, long-chain saturated fatty acids and oleic acid did not affect ACMSD mRNA expression in the liver. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) strongly suppressed the liver ACMSD mRNA expression. Inrats fed with high linoleic acid diet for 8 days, serum quinolinic acid was significantly increased as compared with the rats fed on a fatty acid-free diet under the condition of the approximately same calorie ingestion.These results suggest that the transcription level of ACMSD is modulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids, and suppressive potency of ACMSD mRNA is n-3 fatty acid family>linoleic acid (n-6 fatty acid)>saturated fatty\r\nacid. Moreover, this study provides the information that a high polyunsaturated fatty acid diet affects the production of quinolinic acid in serum by suppressing the ACMSD activity.Int J Vitam Nutr Res. 2007 Mar;77(2):142-8.Dietary protein level and dietary interaction affect quinolinic acid concentration in rats.Egashira Y, Sato M, Saito K, Sanada H. In this study, we examined whether dietary protein level, fatty acid type, namely saturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid, and their interaction affect serum quinolinic acid concentration in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (4-weeks old) were fed with 20% casein + 10% stearic acid diet (20C10S), 20% casein + 10% linoleic acid diet (20C10L), 40% casein + 10% stearic acid diet (40C10S), or40% casein + 10% linoleic acid diet (40C10L)for 8 days, and serum quinolinic acid concentration and ACMSD activity were determined. Serum quinolinic\r\nacidconcentration was significantly increased in the 40C10Lgroup compared with other three groups. There was also the negative correlation between the sum of liver and kidney ACMSD activities, and serum quinolinic acid concentration per tryptophan intake (r = 0.8209, p < 0.01).Increased serum QA concentrations are probably due to a decreased ACMSD activity.Biochim Biophys Acta. 2004 Nov 8;1686(1-2):118-24.Differential effects of dietary fatty acids on rat liver alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde decarboxylase activity and gene expression.Egashira Y, Murotani G, Tanabe A, Saito K, Uehara K, Morise A, Sato M, Sanada H.Int J Vitam Nutr Res. 2007 Mar;77(2):142-8.Dietary protein level and dietary interaction affect quinolinic acid concentration in rats.Egashira Y, Sato M, Saito K, Sanada H.Comp Biochem Physiol A Physiol. 1995\r\nAug;111(4):539-45.Effect of dietary linoleic acid on the tryptophan-niacin metabolism in streptozotocin diabetic rats.Egashira Y, Nakazawa A, Ohta T, Shibata K, Sanada H.Adv Exp Med Biol. 2003;527:671-4.Dietary linoleic acid suppresses gene expression of rat liver  alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) and increases quinolinic acid in serum.Egashira Y, Sato M, Tanabe A, Saito K, Fujigaki S, Sanada H.J Clin Invest. 1994 Mar;93(3):1063-70.Neutrophil migration inhibitory properties of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

In the present study we investigated whether PUFAs might evoke apoptosis in newborn monocytes. In the absence of fatty acids, 30 +/- 4% of control cord monocytes underwent apoptosis or necrosis after 24 h incubation. At a concentration of 50 microM, none of the PUFAs had a significant effect on monocyte cell death,but at a dose of 100 microM, DHA resulted in 60 +/- 4% cell death (P < 0.05) while the other PUFAs had no significant effect. In contrast, at higher concentrations (200 microM), all the PUFAs significantly\r\nincreased monocyte cell death (AA: 70 +/- 5%, DHA: 86+/- 2%, EPA: 70 +/- 4%). PUFAs thus exert a potent influence on cord monocyte cell survival in vitro. Their effect is dose-dependent and DHA appears to be the most potent of the fatty acids tested. The influence of PUFAs on neonatal monocyte-cell survival suggests a novel mechanism whereby PUFAs may modulate the immune response.J Cell Mol Med. 2007 Nov-Dec;11(6):1342-51.Differential cytokine activity and morphology during wound healing in the neonatal and adult rat skin.Wagner W, Wehrmann M.Pharmacol Res Commun. 1978 Jul;10(7):643-56.Role of ACTH on the effect of medroxyprogesterone in brain stem serotonin.Izquierdo JA, Savini C, Borghi E, Rabiller G, Costas S, Justel E.J Cell Mol Med. 2007 Nov-Dec;11(6):1342-51.Differential cytokine activity and morphology during wound healing in the neonatal and adult rat skin.Wagner\r\nW, Wehrmann M.Plast Reconstr Surg. 2002 Jun;109(7):2355-62.The fetal cleft palate: III.

Hepatic alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD; formerly termed picolinic carboxylase) [EC4.1.1.45] plays a key role in regulating NAD biosynthesis and the generation of quinolinate (quinolinic acid) from tryptophan. Quinolinate is a potent endogenous excitotoxin of neuronal cells. We previously reported that ingestion of fatty acids by rats leads to a decrease in their hepatic ACMSD activity. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon is not clarified. We previously purified ACMSD and cloned cDNA encoding rat ACMSD. Therefore, in\r\nthis study, we examined the differential effect of fatty acids on ACMSD mRNA expression by Northern blot. Moreover, we measured quinolinic acid concentration in rats fed on fatty acid. When diets containing 2% level of fatty acid were given to male Sprague-Dawley rats (4 weeks old) for 8 days, long-chain saturated fatty acids and oleic acid did not affect ACMSD mRNA expression in the liver. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) strongly suppressed the liver ACMSD mRNA expression. Inrats fed with high linoleic acid diet for 8 days, serum quinolinic acid was significantly increased as compared with the rats fed on a fatty acid-free diet under the condition of the approximately same calorie ingestion.These results suggest that the transcription level of ACMSD is modulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids, and suppressive potency of ACMSD mRNA is n-3 fatty acid family>linoleic acid (n-6 fatty acid)>saturated fatty\r\nacid. Moreover, this study provides the information that a high polyunsaturated fatty acid diet affects the production of quinolinic acid in serum by suppressing the ACMSD activity.Int J Vitam Nutr Res. 2007 Mar;77(2):142-8.Dietary protein level and dietary interaction affect quinolinic acid concentration in rats.Egashira Y, Sato M, Saito K, Sanada H. In this study, we examined whether dietary protein level, fatty acid type, namely saturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid, and their interaction affect serum quinolinic acid concentration in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (4-weeks old) were fed with 20% casein + 10% stearic acid diet (20C10S), 20% casein + 10% linoleic acid diet (20C10L), 40% casein + 10% stearic acid diet (40C10S), or40% casein + 10% linoleic acid diet (40C10L)for 8 days, and serum quinolinic acid concentration and ACMSD activity were determined. Serum quinolinic\r\nacidconcentration was significantly increased in the 40C10Lgroup compared with other three groups. There was also the negative correlation between the sum of liver and kidney ACMSD activities, and serum quinolinic acid concentration per tryptophan intake (r = 0.8209, p < 0.01).Increased serum QA concentrations are probably due to a decreased ACMSD activity.Biochim Biophys Acta. 2004 Nov 8;1686(1-2):118-24.Differential effects of dietary fatty acids on rat liver alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde decarboxylase activity and gene expression.Egashira Y, Murotani G, Tanabe A, Saito K, Uehara K, Morise A, Sato M, Sanada H.Int J Vitam Nutr Res. 2007 Mar;77(2):142-8.Dietary protein level and dietary interaction affect quinolinic acid concentration in rats.Egashira Y, Sato M, Saito K, Sanada H.Comp Biochem Physiol A Physiol. 1995\r\nAug;111(4):539-45.Effect of dietary linoleic acid on the tryptophan-niacin metabolism in streptozotocin diabetic rats.Egashira Y, Nakazawa A, Ohta T, Shibata K, Sanada H.Adv Exp Med Biol. 2003;527:671-4.Dietary linoleic acid suppresses gene expression of rat liver  alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) and increases quinolinic acid in serum.Egashira Y, Sato M, Tanabe A, Saito K, Fujigaki S, Sanada H.J Clin Invest. 1994 Mar;93(3):1063-70.Neutrophil migration inhibitory properties of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

        "chunk_html": "Pathological Science & General Electric:Threatening the paradigmEverything in biology depends on the internal order of cells, and on the interactions of each cell with its surroundings. All of these orderly interactions involve contacts between biological molecules and water. The forces regulating interactions on that scale must be understood before life can be understood, but the nature of the forces at these interfaces has been controversial for 100 years.In 1953, physicist Irving Langmuir gave a talk at the General Electric laboratory about what he called \"pathological science.\" That talk is still resonating in the scientific culture, and it is used to reinforce attitudes similar to those held by Langmuir, i.e., the dominant scientific paradigm of the 20th century, and to justify certain institutions that regulate\r\ninnovation.For Langmuir, there was a clearly defined \"scientific method,\" and he said some people were led away from the proper method by wishful thinking to interpret ambiguous results as confirmations of their hypothesis. He listed 6 symptoms of pathological science: 1) An effect produced by a barely detectable cause, and 2) the effect is barely detectable, or many measurements are needed because of the very low statistical significance of the results, 3) claims of great accuracy, 4) they involve fantastic theories contrary to experience, 5) criticisms are met byad hocexcuses, and 6) the ratio of supporters to critics approaches 50%, then fades toward zero. He failed to mention these features in any research that supported his view of things, and called an idea pathological when people continued to work on it despite disapproval by the recognized experts. He didn't mention the Nobel prizes that were given for the worm\r\ntheory of cancer or for treating psychological problems with lobotomies, and he didn't mention that there were organized campaigns against the publication of disapproved ideas.The dominant view in biology, which is analogous to Langmuir's view in physics, is that all decisive cellular processes involve the direct mechanical contact of one molecule with another, the activation of a lock (an enzyme or receptor) by a key that has the right shape, or the adhesion of a molecule to another substance according to its chemical composition. An alternative view, now clearly supported by the evidence, is that there are forces that aren't merely between molecular surfaces, but rather that the local conditions at the surfaces of proteins and other molecules, and the properties of the solvent water, are modified by the surrounding conditions. It is this alternative view that is now making progress in understanding disease and health, regeneration and\r\ndegeneration. But to judge the new work, it's important to know the nature of the opposition.Thomas Edison, who was adept at publicizing himself as the inventor of ideas he had bought or stolen, founded General Electric. Attempting to eliminate Nikola Tesla's system of alternating current, since Edison was invested in direct current systems, Edison's GE tried to convince the public that direct current was safer, by using alternating current to electrocute an elephant, and by promoting its use in the electric chair. GE eventually gave up the direct current technology for electrifying cities, and they refined the electric light bulb and were fairly successful in controlling, practically monopolizing, that market, and in shortening the life of incandescent bulbs. Carbon filament bulbs made around 1900 often lasted decades; I had one that kept working until it was broken during a move in 1960. Light bulbs made in England 65 years ago, and in the Soviet\r\nUnion, and bulbs currently made in China, had a life expectancy five times as long as the bulbs made in the US since GE learned how to carefully control the rate at which the tungsten filament deteriorates.Irving Langmuir was their leading light bulb scientist. In his 1932 Nobel lecture, he tediously argued that molecules of gas can form only one layer on a surface such as a filament. About 17 years earlier, Michael Polanyi had demonstrated that molecules can be adsorbed in multilayers, but his evidence was dismissed because, according to the understanding of industrial experts such as Langmuir, and the leading scientific authorities, Einstein, Nernst, and Haber, it was impossible. They were committed to an explanatory system that didn't allow events such as those Polanyi described.Although Polanyi knew that his adsorption isotherm was more realistic than Langmuir's (he had demonstrated many cases that Langmuir's didn't describe\r\ncorrectly), and also easier to understand, he taught Langmuir's isotherm to his students, because he knew that they would be required to know it to pass their examinations. He knew he had risked his career by his earlier exposition of his ideas, and he was unwilling to endanger his students' careers by involving them in the controversy.From 1920 to 1926, before the advent in 1927 of \"quantum physics\" (with its still-argued features of delocalized electrons, molecular orbitals, resonance, non-locality, incommensurability, indeterminism), Polanyi had turned his attention from the physics of adsorption to chemical structure, and his group was the first to show that cellulose was made up of long molecules, polymers, rather than of just associated clusters. That idea didn't catch on, so he turned to the behavior of crystals and metals. He found that crystals were much weaker than they should be, according to the strength of the bonds between their atoms,\r\nand showed that this was because of defects, and that during repeated stresses, they became weaker, as energy migrated through relatively long distances in the substance, to concentrate the defects. The idea of lattice defects was acceptable at that time, but long-range mobility of bond energy was no more acceptable then than it had been when J.C. Bose described metal fatigue, decades earlier.Polanyi also showed that the strength and rigidity of a crystal were altered when the crystal was immersed in water. Again, such an influence of a surface on the over-all physical properties of a solid substance had no noticeable effect on the scientific culture, although his results were published in the major journals. To adjust one's interpretive system at that time to rationalize Polanyi's results would have required discarding the basic assumptions that were behind Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect, and maybe even his theory of\r\nBrownian motion. However, by 2011, fewer people have invested their personal development in those ideas of short-range electrical binding forces that prevailed early in the 20th century, and now, for example, the evidence of \"delocalized holes in DNA\" can be discussed more openly. Eventually, science textbooks may be rewritten to show a steady progression of understanding from Bose, though Polanyi, Perutz, Szent-Gyorgyi, Ling, and Damadian (inventor of the MRI, holder of the patents infringed by GE, non-winner of the Nobel prize).In 1933 J.D. Bernal had proposed a structural model of water that contained a considerable amount of order (Bernal and Fowler, 1933) but by the 1950s the idea of spontaneous ordering in water was out of style, and he worked out a more random structure. Max Perutz, continuing the study of hemoglobin he had begun with Bernal, became concerned with long range forces acting through water: \"The nature of the forces which\r\nkeep particles parallel and equidistant across such great thicknesses of water is not yet clear.\" Normal wet crystals of methemoglobin contain regular layers of water 15 Angstroms thick. He suggested that a laminated structure of the water could plausibly explain his measurements. Comparing the protein crystal to montmorillonite particles, which incorporate several layers of water, each 3 Angstroms thick, each layer of water in the protein crystal would be 4 Angstroms thick, since swelling proceeds in discrete steps of that thickness. 52.4% of the volume of Perutz's normal, stable, wet protein crystals consisted of liquid. Part of the water is a fixed monolayer, but the rest is apparently in the form of mobile, interactive, multilayers. By 1952, Perutz had decided that long range forces weren't involved in hemoglobin crystallization, but he didn't comment on the long range ordering of clays, tobacco mosaic viruses, and other particles and gels. In 2005,\r\nan interlaminar distance of 17.9 Angstroms, or six layers of water, still seems to be stable in hydrated montmorillonite (Odriozola & Aguilar, 2005). Clay continues to be studied in relation to nuclear waste disposal, so the effects of surfaces on water's properties haven't been entirely excluded from science. The interfacial water in clay has special catalytic properties that make it interesting to many researchers (Anderson, 1970)Bernal's and Perutz' conformity in the 1950s rejection of long range forces and an ordered structure of water represented the dominant ideas in physics and physical chemistry, but many people (with very little financial or institutional support) were continuing to study the structure of water, both in the bulk phase and near surfaces, as in cells. Philippa Wiggins, Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, Carlton Hazlewood, Freeman Cope, and Ray Damadian were among the most active proponents of the importance of structured water in\r\nliving cells. Walter Drost-Hansen showed that water near surfaces (vicinal water) is several percent less dense, and has a greater heat capacity, than bulk water, and that bulk water undergoes transitions at certain temperatures that alter its effects on enzyme reactions.The question regarding the nature of the forces at surfaces or interfaces affects how we think about everything, from life to nuclear energy. The political and economic implications of \"non-local energy\" (which is most obvious at surfaces) have at times led to organized campaigns to discourage research in those areas. When Alexandre Rothen found (beginning in 1946) that enzymes and antibodies had non-local effects, several prestigious publications claimed to show how he must have been mistaken:Thefilmshe used must have been porous, despite his demonstrations of their continuity.The methods he developed at Rockefeller Institute\r\nquickly became standard for accurately measuring very thin films. In the early 1970s, a GE employee, Ivar Giaever, visited Rothen's lab to learn his methods. Shortly after his visit, he demonstrated his \"new method\" to the press. I saw an article about it in Science News, and wrote them a short letter, pointing out that the method had been developed and used by Rothen much earlier;they printed my note, which could be seen as a criticism of the author of the news article. About a week later, I got a letter from Rothen, thanking me for writing to the magazine; he said they had refused to publish his own letter explaining the situation, including his interactions with Giaever during the visit. I assume that the magazine felt some kind of pressure to protect Giaever and GE from an authoritative accusation of scientific dishonesty.In 1968 when I began studying biology at the University of Oregon, the professor of microscopy, Andrew Bajer,\r\nposted a display of dozens of micrographs, with explanatory captions, along the halls near the entrance of one of the science buildings. The one that interested me most showed orderly rows of regularly formed objects on a smooth surface. The caption described it as clusters of sodium atoms, deposited from vapor, on a film of a polymer (formvar, I think), under which was a quartz crystal. The caption noted that the sodium atoms had condensed in a pattern representing the crystal structure of the underlying quartz. Although Rothen's work involved proteins deposited from solution, rather than sodium atoms deposited from vapor, Bajer's image illustrated visually the projection of the forces of crystal structure through an amorphous film. This seemed to be a graphic representation of Polanyi's adsorption potential, a force acting on atoms in the space near a surface, as opposed to Langmuir's local atomic force that didn't reach beyond the first layer of\r\natoms. The long range order in this case arranged atoms geometrically, while Rothen's preparations showed a \"projected\" specificity, but of a more complex sort.Just a few months later, someone who knew of Stephen Carter's demonstration that fibroblasts will migrate on a glass slide coated with a gold film, toward areas of greater thickness of the metal, did a similar experiment, but with a formvar film between the gold and the cells. The cells still migrated up the gradient, toward the area of thicker gold under the film. The reaction to that publication was the same as the reaction to Rothen's work 20 years before, the formvar films contained holes, and the cells were reaching through the film to touch the metal surface, sort of like kids peeking around a blindfold when they aren't supposed to be watching. I didn't understand how the holes would explain anything, even if there were holes and if the cells had put out many long filopodia to\r\nreach through the film, but in fact making a formvar film is a very standardized technique. They can be made \"holey,\" or like a very open net, or they can be made solid, just by choosing the concentration of the polymer used. The difference is very clear, under an electron microscope, but the professors needed an excuse for dismissing something they didn't want to understand. Further work was discouraged by their ridicule.In Russia, GE had very little influence on the acceptability of ideas in science, and Boris Deryagin continued (from the 1930s until 1990) to study the properties of water near surfaces. In 1987 his group demonstrated that cells can clear particles from a space around themselves, extending more than a cell's diameter away. This distance is similar to the cell free zone in flowing blood adjacent to the walls of arterioles, which is probably the result of multiple interacting forces. At present, processes such as cell adhesion of\r\nleukocytes and stem cells (and tumor cells) to the blood vessel wall and movement through the blood vessel into the tissues (diapedesis) is explained in terms of adhesion molecules, disregarding the plausible effects of long range attractive or repulsive forces. Clumping or sludging of red blood cells occurs when the organism is failing to adapt to stress, and could be reasonably explained by a failure of protective repulsive fields. These fields are developed and maintained by metabolism, primarily oxidative energy metabolism, and are modified by endogenous regulatory substances and external conditions, including electromagnetic and electrical fields.100 years ago, Albert Einstein was a major influence in popularizing the \"only local\" dogma of atomic interactions. (His work led directly to \"quantum physics,\" but he never accepted its irrational implications.(1)I don't think he ever considered that\r\nthe assumptions in his [atomic-quantized] theory of the photoelectric effect were the problem.) One charged atom is completely neutralized by its association with an oppositely charged atom, and the force is described by the inverse square law, that the force decreases with the square of the distance between point charges, meaning that the force is very strong at very small distances. However, a physicalsurface, a plane where one substance ends and another begins, follows different rules.Different substances have different electron affinities, creating a phase boundary potential, a charged layer at the interface. (Electrical double layers at interfaces are important in semiconductors and electrodes, but biologists have carefully avoided discussing them, except in the very narrow context of electrodes.) The electrically active surface of a substance, even though it's made of atoms and electrons, projects its electrical field in\r\nproportion to its area. This principle is as old as Coulomb's law, but the habit of thinking of electrical charge on the atomic scale seems to make people forget it. It's exactly the sort of space-filling field that Polanyi's adsorption isotherm describes. It's also involved in crystal strength and elasticity as studied by Polanyi, in piezoelectricity, and in generation of semiconduction in amorphous materials, as used in Stan Ovshinsky's processes.Long range structural and electronic interactions produce \"antenna\" effects, which are sensitive to very weak fields, whether they originate inside or outside of the organism. Magnetobiology is often treated as a pseudo-science or pathological science, because \"real science\" considers heating and chemical bond reactions to be the only possible effects of low energy fields or radiation. Solco Tromp, beginning in the 1930s, showed that cells behave like liquid crystals, and that liquid crystals can respond\r\nto very low electrical and magnetic fields.If the adsorption potential structures the water in its region of space, this interfacial water is now a newphase, with different physical properties, including new catalytic properties, such as those recognized by the clay investigators (which increased its ability to dissolve the clay minerals).Several versions of Langmuir's Pathological Science talk have been published, some of them adding new examples, including \"polywater.\" Langmuir died in 1957, and the first example of polywater was observed by N.N. Fedyakin was observed in 1961. When finely drawn quartz or Pyrex glass capillary tubes (with inside diameter of up to a tenth of a millimeter) are suspended in a container with the air pressure reduced, above a container of distilled water, so that they are exposed to pure water vapor at room temperature, after a period of an hour or more (sometimes days or weeks were required) a small\r\ndrop of liquid condenses inside some (a small percentage) of the capillary tubes. Above some of the original drops, a second drop sometimes appeared, that would enlarge as the first drop shrank. This separation of water into two fractions was itself anomalous, and the upper drop was found to be denser than normal water. Many people began studying its properties. Fedyakin found that its thermal expansion was greater, and its vapor pressure lower, than ordinary water. Others found that it had a higher refractive index, viscosity, and surface tension, as well as greater density, than ordinary water.  Birefringence (the splitting of a beam of light into two rays when it passes through an ordered material) was observed in the anomalous water, and this usually indicates the presence of a polymer (Fedyakin, et al., 1965; Willis et al., 1969; Lippincott, et al., 1969) or crystallinity. The water associated with clay is also birefringent (Derjaguin and\r\nGreene-Kelly, 1964), and its properties are different when the clay absorbs it from the vapor phase or from liquid water.Hysteresis is a lag in the behavior of a system, resulting when the internal state of the system is altered by an action, so that it responds differently to a repetition of that action; it's the memory of a system that exists only when the system has internal structure. For example, a gas has relatively little hysteresis. Perfect elasticity is one extreme of an ordered solid, but most solids have some hysteresis, in which the deformed material fails to spring back immediately. Hysteresis of adsorption can be seen at the edges of a drop of water on a tilted surface, with a steeper contact angle on the newer contact at the lower edge, showing a reluctance of the water to wet a new surface, a lower contact angle where the drop is pulling away from the upper surface, a reluctance to break the contact. The same is seen at the edges\r\nof an evaporating-shrinking drop, or a growing drop. Everyone perceives this memory function of water.Boris Deryagin studied both the elasticity and the hysteresis of water near surfaces, and both approaches showed that it contained internal structure. Many dogmatic professors denied that water could show elasticity or \"memory,\" because of their interpretive system/mental rigidity.When Fedyakin got the help of Deryagin's lab in analyzing the anomalous material, many different methods of purifying the glass and the water and the vessel were tried, and its properties were analyzed in many different ways. When  Deryagin first described the material at a conference in Europe, there was great interest, and eventually hundreds of people began investigating it.A British laboratory was the first to get a sample of Deryagin's material in 1966, and their tests confirmed Deryagin's.The US Bureau of Standards, having the best\r\nanalytical instruments in the world (including a microscope spectrometer), studied it carefully. They (Lippincott, Stromberg, Grant, & Cessac, 1969) found that its bonds were stronger than those in ordinary water, and they compared its absorption spectrum (by computer) with those of 100,000 known substances, and found that it corresponded with nothing previously known. It didn't have the absorption band of normal water. When it evaporated, it left no visible residue, and it turned into ordinary water when heated. They concluded that the physical structure that would best fit its absorption spectrum was a polymerized form of water, so they called it \"polywater.\" Later, Lippincott and others (Page, et al., 1970; Petsko, 1970) did proton magnetic resonance analyses that showed a difference of polywater from normal water in the hydrogen bonding, a \"deshielding\" of the protons, meaning that the electrons were arranged differently in the molecules.In\r\n1969 there were many threats to the dominant paradigm, and many people were demanding a change in the government's funding priorities. The public excitement about polywater following the many confirmations of its existence was disturbing to the defenders of the paradigm. Philip Abelson, the chief editor of Science magazine, used the magazine to further his political beliefs.Denis Rousseau, a young researcher at Bell Labs (who now writes about pathological science), published a series of articles in Science describing his tests of polywater. He played tennis until his tee-shirt was soaked with sweat, then extracted and concentrated the sweat into a small gummy pellet. He reported that the infrared spectrum of the sweat concentrate (largely sodium lactate) was very similar to that of polywater. One of the techniques he used to identify impurities (electron spectroscopy) requires a high vacuum, so there couldn't be any normal water present. The\r\nwater associated with ionic impurities is driven off at low temperatures compared to the temperature needed to decompose the anomalous water.Although Rousseau's \"explanation\" was ludicrous, it was just the thing the professors needed to prevent further challenges to their paradigm. Although Deryagin published more evidence of the purity of the anomalous water in 1972, by 1973 the mass media, including Science magazine, were saying that polywater didn't exist, and that Deryagin had admitted that he was mistaken. But polywater was Lippincott's term, and what Deryagin said was that silica was the only impurity that could be identified in the anomalous material.There are many antecedents to anomalous water in the literature. In the 1920s, W.A. Patrick of Johns Hopkins and J. L. Shereshefsky at Howard university investigated the properties of water in fine capillary tubes and found that the vapor pressure wasn't the same as that of normal\r\nwater. (This is what would have been expected, if Polanyi's adsorption isotherm had been accepted.) The density of water in clay has been found to be slightly less than normal. This water bound to clay requires a high temperature to eliminate, similar to the decomposition temperature of polywater. The catalytic properties of interfacial water in clay are recognized, causing it to solublize components of the clay. So it's hard to imagine that there wouldn't be some silica in the material formed in quartz or glass capillary tubes.The only thing pathological about the polywater episode was the extreme effort that was made to stigmatize a whole category of research, to restore faith in the old doctrine that insisted there are no long range ordering processes anywhere in the universe.The successful campaign against polywater strengthened the mainstream denial of the evidence of ordering in interfacial and intracellular water, kept the\r\ndoctrine of the lipid bilayer cell membrane alive, and up until the present has prevented the proper use of MRI scans in medical diagnosis.In 1946, while the government was studying the way nuclear fallout was influenced by the weather, a group at GE, led by Langmuir, began experimenting with weather control by means of \"cloud seeding.\" Langmuir observed that the energy in a cloud system was greater than that in an atomic bomb, and that by seeding clouds in Europe, disastrous weather effects could be created in the Soviet Union. The GE group convinced the Pentagon to become involved in weather control. (The physicist Ross Gunn was transferred directly from work on the atomic bomb to direct the cloud seeding project.) In one of Langmuir's seeding experiments, he claimed that he had changed the direction of a hurricane moving toward the U.S. When a young researcher pointed out that the weather service had predicted exactly that change of\r\ndirection, based on the temperatures of ocean currents, Langmuir became angry, and told the man that he wasn't going to explain it to him, because he was too stupid to understand.Langmuir's attitude toward science was exactly what GE wanted; his career and reputation were part of the corporation's public relations and business plan. Science was whatever GE thought was good for their business. That science was pathological, sometimes by Langmuir's own defining features, most of the time by the effects it has had on society. The Manhattan Project was central to GE's business plan, and when the bomb project was completed GE and the Atomic Energy Commission found that the same subsidies could be used to develop nuclear generators of electricity. Following Edison's pioneering work with x-rays, x-ray imaging machines had become very profitable for GE. It was important to assure the public that medical, industrial, and military radiation was well\r\nunderstood, well controlled, safe, and essential for the general welfare. In their view, if every woman could have access to GE's x-ray mammograms, for example, almost all breast cancers could be cured. The radiation exposure from living near a GE nuclear power generator is infinitesimal compared to living in Denver or flying in an airplane. (There is some discussion of these issues in my January, 2011 newsletter, \"Radiation and growth.\") Public relations involves everything from \"basic research\" to television advertising.If nuclear energy is as safe as the industry and governments say it is, the reactors should be located in the centers of large cities, because transmitting electric power long distances is presently wasting 50% of the power (Hirose Takashi, The Nuclear Disaster that could destroy Japan...and the world, 2011). Admiral Rickover, influential advocate of nuclear power, said \"...every time you produce radiation, [a] horrible force [is\r\nunleashed,] and I think there the human race is going to wreck itself. [We must] outlaw nuclear reactors\" (January, 1982 congressional testimony) Helen Caldicott says Fukushima is many times worse than Chernobyl. The radioactive cesium in German mushrooms and truffles hasn't decreased 25 years after Chernobyl, and the German government is spending increasing amounts to compensate hunters for the wild boars (who eat truffles) that must be disposed of as radioactive waste.(2)General Electric sent its condolences to the people of Japan, and said the reactors of that design had functioned well for 40 years; they didn't mention that Unit I at Fukushima had been scheduled to be shut down on March 26, 2011, the end of its 40 year life expectancy. In late March, as the accident continued, Tepco applied for a permit to build two new reactors at the Fukushima site. In the US, the government continues its loan guarantee\r\npolicy to subsidize new reactor construction.After many years of working with his metalized slides, Alexandre Rothen found that their activity, the strength of their long-range influence, varied with a 24 hour cycle, and that their activity could also be destroyed or restored by putting them in a magnetic field, parallel or perpendicular to the surface. Around the same time, a Russian biochemist, Simon Shnoll, noticed that there were cyclic changes in well defined enzymic reactions. Like Rothen, Shnoll did experiments that showed that the earth's motion (relative to the stars) affected measurements in the laboratory, even measurements of alpha particles produced by nuclear fission. Organized matter, whether it's cellular or in the crystalline solid state, is susceptible to surrounding conditions.In 1971 or '72 I learned of H.C. Dudley's idea of a \"neutrino sea,\" that he suggested might be equivalent to the \"luminiferous ether\" that had\r\npreviously been used to explain light and electromagnetism. I wrote to him, asking if he thought neutrinos could be involved in biological ordering processes by resonating with matter under some circumstances. He had been developing a theory, in which atomic nuclei might interact with a neutrino \"ether,\" in ways that could affect the decay rate of the unstable isotopes, and so it didn't seem unreasonable to him that biological structures might also interact with neutrinos. In October, 1972, he published a purely theoretical article in which he explained that nuclear reactors might under some conditions become dangerously unstable. I had earlier seen a newspaper article about an experiment by a physicist, J.L. Anderson, in which radioactive carbon-14 didn't follow the normal rules of random decay, when the isotope was incorporated into an oil, which was spread in a monolayer on a metal surface. By chance, Anderson's experimental article was published\r\nsimultaneously with Dudley's theoretical article, though neither one knew of the other's work.Nearly all physicists said his results weren't possible, because the small forces involved in adsorbing an oil to a metal surface were infinitesimal compared to the force needed to cause nuclear reactions. Over the next few years, Dudley and others did some experiments that appeared to confirm Anderson's results, showing that the rate of nuclear reactions can be modified by mild changes in the physical state of the unstable elements.Anderson's and Dudley's work didn't get much attention from the public, so there was no need for the defenders of the dominant paradigm to attack it. There was no financial support for continuing their research.Behind the industries' assurances that \"low level\" radiation is safe, whether it's ionizing radiation, microwave or broadcast frequency electromagnetic radiation, is their reductionist approach to physics,\r\nchemistry, and biology. Those doctrines no longer have the prestige that they once did, but their pathological, authoritarian \"science\" culture is being sustained by the influence of corporations on mass culture.With the institutions of research and education controlled by pharmaceutical, military and industrial interests for their own benefit, fundamental progress in knowledge is a threat to the system.NOTES1. From Einstein's 1926 letter to Max Born: \"Quantum mechanics is very worthy of regard. But an inner voice tells me that this is not yet the right track. The theory yields much, but it hardly brings us closer to the Old One's secrets. I, in any case, am convinced the He does not play dice.\" Quoted in P. Busch and G. Jaeger, \"Unsharp quantum reality,\" 4 May 2010.2. None of the major\r\ninstitutions in the US are providing basic information about protection from Fukushima's radioactive fallout. Eating foods produced before the arrival of the radioactive rain, feeding old foods to chickens and milk animals, and keeping your metabolic rate high, are the main defenses. Eventually, fertilizing crops with mined minerals, and enriching the atmosphere with carbon from coal will dilute the radioactive isotopes from the nuclear accidents.REFERENCESDM Anderson,Role of interfacial water and water in thin films in the origin of life,http://history.nasa.gov/CP-2156/ch1.4.htmDM Anderson and AR Tice, 1970,Low-temperature phases of interfacial water in clay-water systems,Crrel Research Reports, Army Dept, US, Res\r\nRpt 290. \"The low temperature exotherms do not depend critically upon water content, but clearly they are related to clay mineral and exchangeable cation type.

        "chunk_html": "Protective CO2 and agingThe therapeutic effects of increasing carbon dioxide are being more widely recognized in recent years. Even Jane Brody, the NY Times writer on health topics, has favorably mentioned the use of the Buteyko method for asthma, and the idea of permissive hypercapnia during mechanical ventilation, to prevent lung damage from excess oxygen, has been discussed in medical journals. But still very few biologists recognize its role as a fundamental, universal protective factor. I think it will be helpful to consider some of the ways carbon dioxide might be controlling situations that otherwise are poorly understood.The brain has a high rate of oxidative metabolism, and so it forms a very large proportion of the carbon dioxide\r\nproduced by an organism. It also governs, to a great extent, the metabolism of other tissues, including their consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide or lactic acid. Within a particular species, the rate of oxygen consumption increases in proportion to brain size, rather than body weight. Between very different species, the role of the brain in metabolism is even more obvious, since the resting metabolic rate corresponds to the size of the brain. For example, a cats brain is about the size of a crocodiles, and their oxygen consumption at rest is similar, despite their tremendous difference in body size.Stress has to be understood as a process that develops in time, and the brain (especially the neocortex and the frontal lobes) organizes the adaptive and developmental processes in both the spatial and temporal dimensions. The meaning of a situation influences the way the organism responds. For example, the stress of\r\nbeing restrained for a long time can cause major gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcerization, but if the animal has the opportunity to bite something during the stress (signifying its ability to fight back, and the possibility of escape) it can avoid the stress ulcers.The patterning of the nervous activity throughout the body governs the local ability to produce carbon dioxide. When the cortex of the brain is damaged or removed, an animal becomes rigid, so the cortex is considered to have a tonic inhibitory action on the body. But when the nerves are removed from a muscle (for example, by disease or accident), the muscle goes into a state of constant activity, and its ability to oxidize glucose and produce carbon dioxide is reduced, while its oxidation of fatty acids persists, increasing the production of toxic oxidative fragments of the fatty acids, which contributes to the muscles atrophy.The organisms\r\nintentions, expectations, or plans, are represented in the nervous system as a greater readiness for action, and in the organs and tissues controlled by the nerves, as an increase or decrease of oxidative efficiency, analogous to the differences between innervated and denervated muscles. This pattern in the nervous system has been called the acceptor of action, because it is continually being compared with the actual situation, and being refined as the situation is evaluated. The state of the organism, under the influence of a particular acceptor of action, is called a functional system, including all the components of the organism that participate most directly in realizing the intended adaptive action.The actions of nerves can be considered anabolic, because during a stressful situation in which the catabolic hormones of adaption, e.g., cortisol, increase, the tissues of the functional system are protected, and while idle\r\ntissues may undergo autophagy or other form of involution, the needs of the active tissues are supplied with nutrients from their breakdown, allowing them to change and, when necessary, grow in size or complexity.The brains role in protecting against injury by stress, when it sees a course of action, has a parallel in the differences between concentric (positive, muscle shortening) and eccentric (negative, lengthening under tension) exercise, and also with the differences between innervated and denervated muscles.  In eccentric exercise and denervation, less oxygen is used and less carbon dioxide is produced, while lactic acid increases, displacing carbon dioxide, and more fat is oxidized. Prolonged stress similarly decreases carbon dioxide and increases lactate, while increasing the use of fat.Darkness is stressful and catabolic. For example, in aging people, the morning urine contains nearly all of the\r\ncalcium lost during the 24 hour period, and mitochondria are especially sensitive to the destructive effects of darkness. Sleep reduces the destructive catabolic effects of darkness. During the rapid-eye-movement (dreaming) phase of sleep, breathing is inhibited, and the level of carbon dioxide in the tissues accumulates. In restful sleep, the oxygen tension is frequently low enough, and the carbon dioxide tension high enough, to trigger the multiplication of stem cells and mitochondria.Dreams represent the acceptor of action operating independently of the sensory information that it normally interacts with. During dreams, the brain (using a system called the Ascending Reticular Activating System) disconnects itself from the sensory systems. I think this is the nervous equivalent of concentric/positive muscle activity, in the sense that the brain is in control of its actions. The active, dreaming phase of sleep occurs more\r\nfrequently in the later part of the night, as morning approaches. This is the more stressful part of the night, with cortisol and some other stress hormones reaching a peak at dawn, so it would be reasonable for the brains defensive processes to be most active at that time. The dreaming process in the brain is associated with deep muscle relaxation, which is probably associated with the trophic (restorative) actions of the nerves.In ancient China the Taoists were concerned with longevity, and according to Joseph Needham (Science and Civilization in China) their methods included the use of herbs, minerals, and steroids extracted from the urine of children. Some of those who claimed extreme longevity practiced controlled breathing and tai chi (involving imagery, movement, and breating), typically in the early morning hours, when stress reduction is most important. As far as I know, there are no studies of carbon dioxide levels in\r\npractitioners of tai chi, but the sensation of warmth they typically report suggests that it involves hypoventilation.In the 1960s, a Russian researcher examined hospital records of measurements of newborn babies, and found that for several decades the size of their heads had been increasing. He suggested that it might be the result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.The experiences and nutrition of a pregnant animal are known to affect the expression of genes in the offspring, affecting such things as allergies, metabolic rate, brain size, and intelligence. Miles Storfer (1999) has reviewed the evidence for epigenetic environmental control of brain size and intelligence. The main mechanisms of epigenetic effects or imprinting are now known to involve methylation and acetylation of the chromosomes (DNA and histones).Certain kinds of behavior, as well as nutrition and other environmental\r\nfactors, increase the production and retention of carbon dioxide. The normal intrauterine level of carbon dioxide is high, and it can be increased or decreased by changes in the mothers physiology. The effects of carbon dioxide on many biological processes involving methylation and acetylation of the genetic material suggest that the concentration of carbon dioxide during gestation might regulate the degree to which parental imprinting will persist in the developing fetus. There is some evidence of increased demethylation associated with the low level of oxygen in the uterus (Wellman, et al., 2008). A high metabolic rate and production of carbon dioxide would increase the adaptability of the new organism, by decreasing the limiting genetic imprints.A quick reduction of carbon dioxide caused by hyperventilation can provoke an epileptic seizure, and can increase muscle spasms and vascular leakiness, and (by releasing serotonin and\r\nhistamine) contribute to inflammation and clotting disorders. On a slightly longer time scale, a reduction of carbon dioxide can increase the production of lactic acid, which is a promoter of inflammation and fibrosis. A prolonged decrease in carbon dioxide can increase the susceptibility of proteins to glycation (the addition of aldehydes, from polyunsaturated fat peroxidation or methylglyoxal from lactate metabolism, to amino groups), and a similar process is likely to contribute to the methylation of histones, a process that increases with aging. Histones regulate genetic activity.With aging, DNA methylation is increased (Bork, et al., 2009).I suggest that methylation stabilizes and protects cells when growth and regeneration arent possible (and that its likely to increase when CO2 isnt available).Hibernation (Morin and Storey, 2009) and sporulation (Ruiz-Herrera, 1994; Clancy, et al., 2002)\r\nappear to use methylation protectively.Parental stress, prenatal stress, early life stress, and even stress in adulthood contribute to imprinting of the genes, partly through methylation of DNA and the histones.Methionine and choline are the main dietary sources of methyl donors. Restriction of methionine has many protective effects, including increased average (42%) and maximum (44%) longevity in rats (Richie, et al., 1994). Restriction of methyl donors causes demethylation of DNA (Epner, 2001).The age accelerating effect of methionine might be related to disturbing the methylation balance, inappropriately suppressing cellular activity. Besides its effect on the methyl pool, methionine inhibits thyroid function and damages mitochondria.The local concentration of carbon dioxide in specific tissues and organs can be adjusted by nervous and hormonal activation or inhibition of the carbonic\r\nanhydrase enzymes, that accelerate the oonversion of CO2 to carbonic acid, H2CO3. The activity of carbonic anhydrase can determine the density and strength of the skeleton, the excitability of nerves, the accumulation of water, and can regulate the structure and function of the tissues and organs.Ordinarily, carbon dioxide and bicarbonate are thought of only in relation to the regulation of pH, and only in a very general way. Because of the importance of keeping the pH of the blood within a narrow range, carbon dioxide is commonly thought of as a toxin, because an excess can cause unconsciousness and acidosis. But increasing carbon dioxide doesnt necessarily cause acidosis, and acidosis caused by carbon dioxide isnt as harmful as lactic acidosis.Frogs and toads, being amphibians, are especially dependent on water, and in deserts or areas with a dry season they can survive a prolonged dry period by burrowing into mud or\r\nsand. Since they may be buried 10 or 11 inches below the surface, they are rarely found, and so havent been extensively studied. In species that live in the California desert, they have been known to survive 5 years of burial without rainfall, despite a moderately warm average temperature of their surroundings. One of their known adaptations is to produce a high level of urea, allowing them to osmotically absorb and retain water. (Very old people sometimes have extremely high urea and osmotic tension.)Some laboratory studies show that as a toad burrows into mud, the amount of carbon dioxide in its tissues increases. Their skin normally functions like a lung, exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide. If the toads nostrils are at the surface of the mud, as dormancy begins its breathing will gradually slow, increasing the carbon dioxide even more. Despite the increasing carbon dioxide, the pH is kept stable by an increase of bicarbonate\r\n(Boutilier, et al., 1979). A similar increase of bicarbonate has been observed in hibernating hamsters and doormice.Thinking about the long dormancy of frogs reminded me of a newspaper story I read in the 1950s. Workers breaking up an old concrete structure found a dormant toad enclosed in the concrete, and it revived soon after being released. The concrete had been poured decades earlier.Although systematic study of frogs or toads during their natural buried estivation has been very limited, there have been many reports of accidental discoveries that suggest that the dormant state might be extended indefinitely if conditions are favorable. Carbon dioxide has antioxidant effects, and many other stabilizing actions, including protection against hypoxia and the excitatory effects of intracellular calcium and inflammation (Baev, et al., 1978, 1995; Bari, et al., 1996; Brzecka, 2007; Kogan, et al., 1994; Malyshev, et al.,\r\n1995).When mitochondria are uncoupled, they produce more carbon dioxide than normal, and the mitochondria produce fewer free radicals. Animals with uncoupled mitochondria live longer than animals with the ordinary, more efficient mitochondria, that produce more reactive oxidative fragments. One effect of the high rate of oxidation of the uncoupled mitochondria is that they can eliminate polyunsatured fatty acids that might otherwise be integrated into tissue structures, or function as inappropriate regulatory signals.Birds have a higher metabolic rate than mammals of the same size, and live longer. Their tissues contain fewer of the highly unsaturated fatty acids. Queen bees, which live many times longer than worker bees, have mainly monounsaturated fats in their tissues, while the tissues of the short-lived worker bees, receiving a different diet, within a couple of weeks of hatching will contain highly unsaturated\r\nfats.Bats have a very high metabolic rate, and an extremely long lifespan for an animal of their size. While most animals of their small size live only a few years, many bats live a few decades. Bat caves usually have slightly more carbon dioxide than the outside atmosphere, but they usually contain a large amount of ammonia, and bats maintain a high serum level of carbon dioxide, which protects them from the otherwise toxic effects of the ammonia.The naked mole rat, another small animal with an extremely long lifespan (in captivity they have lived up to 30 years, 9 or 10 times longer than mice of the same size) has a low basal metabolic rate, but I think measurements made in laboratories might not represent their metabolic rate in their natural habitat. They live in burrows that are kept closed, so the percentage of oxygen is lower than in the outside air, and the percentage of carbon dioxide ranges from 0.2% to 5%\r\n(atmospheric CO2 is about 0.038). The temperature and humidity in their burrows can be extremely high, and to be very meaningful their metabolic rate would have to be measured when their body temperature is raised by the heat in the burrow.When they have been studied in Europe and the US, there has been no investigation of the effect of altitude on their metabolism, and these animals are native to the high plains of Kenya and Ethiopia, where the low atmospheric pressure would be likely to increase the level of carbon dioxide in their tissues. Consequently, I doubt that the longevity seen in laboratory situations accurately reflects the longevity of the animals in their normal habitat.Besides living in a closed space with a high carbon dioxide content, mole rats have another similarity to bees. In each colony, there is only one female that reproduces, the queen, and, like a queen bee, she is the largest individual in the\r\ncolony. In beehives, the workers carefully regulate the carbon dioxide concentration, which varies from about 0.2% to 6%, similar to that of the mole rat colony. A high carbon dioxide content activates the ovaries of a queen bee, increasing her fertility.Since queen bees and mole rats live in the dark, I think their high carbon dioxide compensates for the lack of light. (Both light and CO2 help to maintain oxidative metabolism and inhibit lactic acid formation.) Mole rats are believed to sleep very little. During the night, normal people tolerate more CO2, and so breathe less, especially near morning, with increased active dreaming sleep.A mole rat has never been known to develop cancer. Their serum C-reactive protein is extremely low, indicating that they are resistant to inflammation. In humans and other animals that are susceptible to cancer, one of the genes that is likely to be silenced by stress, aging, and\r\nmethylation is p53, a tumor-suppressor gene.If the intrauterine experience, with low oxygen and high carbon dioxide, serves to reprogram cells to remove the accumulated effects of age and stress, and so to maximize the developmental potential of the new organism, a life thats lived with nearly those levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide might be able to avoid the progressive silencing of genes and loss of function that cause aging and degenerative diseases.Several diseases and syndromes are now thought to involve abnormal methylation of genes. Prader-Willi sydrome, Angelmans syndrome, and various autistic spectrum disorders, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and several kinds of cancer seem to involve excess methylation.Moderate methionine restriction (for example, using gelatin regularly in the diet) might be practical, but if increased carbon dioxide can activate the\r\ndemethylase enzymes in a controlled way, it might be a useful treatment for the degenerative diseases and for aging itself.The low carbon dioxide production of hypothyroidism (e.g., Lee and Levine, 1999), and the respiratory alkalosis of estrogen excess, are often overlooked. An adequate supply of calcium, and sometimes supplementation of salt and baking soda, can increase the tissue content of CO2.REFERENCESAm J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 2009 Apr;296(4):E621-7.Uncoupling protein-2 regulates lifespan in mice.Andrews ZB, Horvath TL.Fiziol Zh SSSR 1978 Oct;64(10):1456-62.[Role of CO2 fixation in increasing the body's resistance to acute hypoxia].Baev VI, Vasil'ev VV, Nikolaeva EN. In rats, the phenomenon of\r\nconsiderable increase in resistance to acute hypoxia observed after 2-hour stay under conditions of gradually increasing concentration of CO2, decreasing concentration of O2, and external cooling at 2--3 degrees seems to be based mainly on changes in concentration of CO2 (ACCORDINGLY, PCO2 and other forms of CO2 in the blood). The high resistance to acute hypoxia develops as well after subcutaneous or i.v. administration of 1.0 ml of water solution (169.2 mg/200 g) NaHCO2, (NH4)2SO4, MgSO4, MnSO4, and ZnSO4 (in proportion: 35 : 5 : 2 : 0.15 : 0.15, resp.) or after 1-hour effect of increased hypercapnia and hypoxia without cooling.Fiziol Zh Im I M Sechenova 1995 Feb;81(2):47-52.[The unknown physiological role of carbon dioxide].Baev VI, Vasil'eva IV, L'vov SN, Shugalei IV [The data suggests that carbon dioxide is a natural element of the organism antioxidant defence system. ion poisoning].Stroke. 1996 Sep;27(9):1634-9;\r\ndiscussion 1639-40.Differential effects of short-term hypoxia and hypercapnia on N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced cerebral vasodilatation in piglets.Bari F, Errico RA, Louis TM, Busija DW.Vojnosanit Pregl.  1996 Jul-Aug;53(4):261-74.[Carbon dioxide inhibits the generation of active forms of oxygen in human and animal cells and the significance of the phenomenon in biology and medicine][Article in Serbian] Boljevic S, Kogan AH, Gracev SV, Jelisejeva SV, Daniljak IG.J Exp Biol. 1979 Oct;82:357-65.Acid-base relationships in the blood of the toad, Bufo marinus.

Adaptive mechanisms may diminish the detrimental effects of recurrent nocturnal hypoxia in obstructive\r\nsleep apnea (OSA). The potential role of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) in improving brain oxygenation in the patients with severe OSA syndrome is discussed. CO2 increases oxygen uptake by its influence on the regulation of alveolar ventilation and ventilation-perfusion matching, facilitates oxygen delivery to the tissues by changing the affinity of oxygen to hemoglobin, and increases cerebral blood flow by effects on arterial blood pressure and on cerebral vessels. Recent clinical studies show improved brain oxygenation when hypoxia is combined with hypercapnia. Anti-inflammatory and protective against organ injury properties of CO2 may also have therapeutic importance. These biological effects of hypercapnia may improve brain oxygenation under hypoxic conditions. This may be especially important in patients with severe OSA syndrome.Ageing Res Rev. 2009 Oct;8(4):268-76.

Overall, they display increased sensitivity to anesthetics, higher incidence of perioperative cardiovascular morbidity, increased risks for postoperative ventilatory failure and other physiological derangements. The previously described physiological basis for the increased incidence of postoperative ventilatory failure in hypothyroid patients includes decreased central and peripheral ventilatory responses to hypercarbia and hypoxia, muscle weakness, depressed central respiratory drive, and resultant alveolar hypoventilation. These ventilatory failures are associated most frequently with\r\nsevere hypoxia and carbon dioxide (CO2) retention. The purpose of this clinical report is to discuss an interesting and unique anesthetic presentation of a patient with severe hypothyroidism. CLINICAL FEATURES: We describe an unique presentation of ventilatory failure in a 58 yr old man with severe hypothyroidism. He had exceedingly low perioperative respiratory rate (3-4 bpm) and minute ventilation volume, and at the same time developed primary acute respiratory alkalosis and associated hypocarbia (P(ET)CO2 approximately 320-22 mmHg). CONCLUSION: Our patient's ventilatory failure was based on unacceptably low minute ventilation and respiratory rate that was unable to sustain adequate oxygenation. His profoundly lowered basal metabolic rate and decreased CO2 production, resulting probably from severe hypothyroidism, may have resulted in development of acute respiratory alkalosis in spite of concurrently diminished minute ventilation.Anal Bioanal\r\nChem. 2008 Jan;390(2):679-88.

The orchestrated expression of genes is essential for the development and survival of every organism. In addition to the role of transcription factors, the availability of genes for transcription is controlled by a series of proteins that regulate epigenetic chromatin remodeling. The two most\r\nstudied epigenetic phenomena are DNA methylation and histone-tail modifications. Although a large body of literature implicates the deregulation of histone acetylation and DNA methylation with the pathogenesis of cancer, recently epigenetic mechanisms have also gained much attention in the neuroscientific community. In fact, a new field of research is rapidly emerging and there is now accumulating evidence that the molecular machinery that regulates histone acetylation and DNA methylation is intimately involved in synaptic plasticity and is essential for learning and memory. Importantly, dysfunction of epigenetic gene expression in the brain might be involved in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. In particular, it was found that inhibition of histone deacetylases attenuates synaptic and neuronal loss in animal models for various neurodegenerative diseases and improves cognitive function. In this article, we will summarize recent data in the\r\nnovel field of neuroepigenetics and discuss the question why epigenetic strategies are suitable therapeutic approaches for the treatment of brain diseases.Ukr Biokhim Zh 1994 Jan-Feb;66(1):109-12.[Protective effect of sodium bicarbonate in nitrite ion poisoning].Shugalei IV, L'vov SN, Baev VI, Tselinskii IVAm J Respir Crit Care Med.  2000 Mar;161(3 Pt 1):891-8.Modulation of release of reactive oxygen species by the contracting diaphragm.Stofan DA, Callahan LA, DiMarco AF, Nethery DE, Supinski GS.Ecology: Vol. 50, No. 3, pp. 492-494.Carbon Dioxide Retention: A Mechanism of Ammonia Tolerance in Mammals.Studier EM and Fresquez AA.Sci Signal. 2009 Mar 31;2(64): pe17.Reversing DNA methylation: new insights from neuronal activity-induced Gadd45b in adult neurogenesis.Wu H, Sun YE. Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain involves activity-dependent\r\nexpression of genes critical for the proliferation of progenitors and for neuronal maturation. A recent study suggests that the stress response gene Gadd45b (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 beta) can be transiently induced by neuronal activity and may promote adult neurogenesis through dynamic DNA demethylation of specific gene promoters in adult hippocampus. These results provide evidence supporting the provocative ideas that active DNA demethylation may occur in postmitotic neurons and that DNA methylation-mediated dynamic epigenetic regulation is involved in regulating long-lasting changes in neural plasticity in mammalian brains.Patol Fiziol Eksp Ter. 2005 Apr-Jun;(2):13-5.[The effect of the NMDA-receptor blocker MK-801 on sensitivity of the respiratory system to carbon dioxide]Tarakanov IA, Dymetska A, Tarasova NN.Life Sci. 1997;61(5):523-35.Effect of acidotic challenges on local depolarizations\r\nevoked by N-methyl-D-aspartate in the rat striatum.Urenjak J, Zilkha E, Gotoh M, Obrenovitch TP.  Hypercapnia reduced NMDA-evoked responses in a concentration-dependent manner, with 7.5 and 15 % CO2 in the breathing mixture reducing the depolarization amplitude to 74 % and 64 % of that of the initial stimuli, respectively.

        "chunk_html": "Genes, Carbon Dioxide and Adaptation\"Over the oxygen supply of the body carbon dioxide spreads its protecting wings.\"- Friedrich Miescher, Swiss physiologist, 1885To reach useful simplicities, we usually have to sift through the accumulated rationalizations previous generations have produced to justify doing things their way. If we could start with an accurate understanding of what life is, and what we are doing here, science could be built up deductively as well as by the accumulation of evidence. But the fact that we have grown up amid false and unworkable models of what life is, means that we have to lean heavily on evidence, building up new models inductively, imaginatively, and scientifically. Textbooks and professional journals can be useful if\r\nthey are seen as monuments to past beliefs, and not as authorities to be accepted. Examining the dogmatic models of life and the world in which life exists, we can better understand the nature of the existing barriers to constructive work.The Central Dogma of the molecular geneticists, in their own words, was that information flows only from DNA to RNA, and from RNA to protein, never in the other direction. The Central Dogma was formulated to suppress forever the Lamarckian idea of the inheritance of acquired characters, that Weismann's amputation of the tails of a multitude of mice had attempted to deal with earlier in the history of genetics.The Central Dogma continues to be influential, even after a series of revisions. Until the 1990s, the only \"practical\" fruit of genetics had been genocide, but now it has become possible to insert genes into bacteria, and to use the bacteria to produce industrial quantities of specific proteins. In principle, that could be useful, although bovine growth hormone poses a threat to the health of both people and cows, human growth hormone poses a threat to athletes and old people, and human insulin could increase the number of treated diabetics. A deranged culture will put anything cheap to bad use. The ability to make organisms produce foreign proteins confirms that information can flow from DNA to protein, but as that technology was being developed, the discovery of retroviruses showed that the Central Dogma of molecular\r\ngenetics was wrong, RNA is a very significant template for the production of DNA. And the scrapie prion shows that proteins can be infectious, passing along information without nucleic acids as the agent of transmission. The directed mutations demonstrated by John Cairns and others have thoroughly destroyed the Central Dogma of molecular genetics, even as it applied to the simplest organisms, but molecular genetics survives as an industrial and forensic technology.Although evidence suggests that about 2% of human diseases involve the inheritance of an abnormal protein, the exact way the disease develops is never as clear as the geneticists would imply. And the major diseases, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, depression, etc., that are so often blamed on \"genes,\" are so poorly understood\r\nthat it is arbitrary and crazy to talk about the way genes \"cause\" them. People who had never had a problem with diabetes in their culture, very soon suffered from the same rate of diabetes as their neighbors when they immigrated into Israel and began eating the European style diet. The interesting thing about the genetic explanation for disease is how its proponents can believe what they are saying. If you read Konrad Lorenz's writings on racial hygiene, you can imagine that he might have really come to believe what he was saying, even if it was an invention that earned him personal prestige and revenge against people who were reluctant to accept his ideas of cultural excellence and inferiority. When I listened to Gunther Stent praising the doctrine he had taken straight from Konrad Lorenz's original genocide papers, I wondered how a German who had escaped the holocaust with his Jewish family when he was nine years old could talk about those doctrines\r\nwithout anger, and without pointing out the purpose for which they had been created. In the audience, a professor who had been a refugee from Hungary defended the doctrine, saying that a man and his work have nothing to do with each other, though the whole content of the doctrine was that a man and his work are identical, because his behavior is determined by his genes. These were mature, internationally known intellectuals, who made the most amazingly self-contradictory statements without embarrassment, because they were committed, for some deep, mysterious reason, to the doctrine of genetic determinism. If these refugees could espouse the rationale for \"racial hygiene\" as their own, I suppose it isn't so hard to understand that people can devote their life to studying the genetics of diabetes, even though diabetes has appeared suddenly in one generation of immigrants when their diet was suddenly changed, a massive fact that bluntly contradicts the\r\ngenetic doctrine. There is something very deep in our culture that loves genetics.One of the cultural trends that makes genetic determinism attractive is the theory of radical individualism, something that has grown up with protestant christianity, according to some historians. Roger Williams' work in nutrition seemed to be powered by this idea of individual genetic uniqueness, and in his case, the idea led him to some useful insights--he suggested that the environment could be adjusted to suit the highly specific needs of the individual. This idea led to the widespread belief that nutritional supplements might be needed by a large part of the population. Extreme nurturing of the deviant individual is the opposite extreme from the Lorenzian-Hitlerian solution, of eliminating everyone who wasn't a perfect\r\nAryan specimen.But Williams' genetic doctrine assumed that our nutritional needs were primarily inborn, determined by our unique genes. However, there is a famous experiment in which rats were made deficient in riboflavin, and when their corneal tissue showed evidence of the vitamin deficiency, they were given a standard diet. However, the standard diet no longer met the needs of their eye tissue, and during the remainder of the observation period, only a dose of riboflavin several times higher than normal would prevent the signs of deficiency. A developmental change had taken place in the cornea, making its vitamin B2 requirement abnormally high. If we accept the epigenetic, developmental idea of metabolic requirements, our idea of nurturing environmental support would consider the long-range effects of\r\nenvironmental adequacy, and would consider that much disease could be prevented by prenatal support, and by avoiding extreme deficiencies at any time. Williams himself emphasized the importance of prenatal nutrition in disease prevention, so he wasn't a genetic totalitarian; combining the idea of unique genetic individuality with the recognition that malnutrition causes disease, led him to believe in the necessity for nutitional adequacy, rather than to the extermination of the sick, weak, or different individuals.The idea of \"genetic determinism\" says that our traits are the result of the specific proteins that are produced by our specific genes. The doctrine allows for some gradations, such as \"half a dose\" of a trait, but in practice it becomes a purely subjective accounting for everything in terms of\r\nmysterious degrees of \"penetrance\" of genes, and interactions with unknown factors. Proteins, that supposedly express our genetic constitution, include enzymes, structural proteins, antibodies, and a variety of protein hormones and peptide regulatory molecules. Every protein, including the smallest peptide (except certain cyclic peptides), contains at least one amine group, and usually several. Amine groups react spontaneously with carbon dioxide, to form carbamino groups, and they can also react, nonenzymically, with sugars, in the reaction called glycation or glycosylation. These chemical changes alter the functions of the proteins, so that hormones and their \"receptors,\" tubules and filaments, enzymes and synthetic systems, all behave differently under their influences. (The proteins' electrical charge, relationship to water and fats, and shape, change quickly and reversibly as the concentration of carbon dioxide changes; in the absence of carbon\r\ndioxide, these properties tend to change irreversibly under the influence of metabolic stress.)This is the clearest, and the most powerful, instance of metabolic influence on biological structure. That makes it very remarkable that it has been the subject of so few publications. I think the absence of discussion of this fundamental biological principle can be understood only in relation to the great importance it has for a new understanding of development and inheritance--it is an easily documented process that will invalidate some of the most deeply held beliefs of most of the people who are influential in science and politics.I will continue discussing some of\r\nthese implications in newsletters on imprinting, degenerative diseases, heart attacks, high blood pressure, and other special biological questions, but I think the most important work that remains to be done is to work out the exact mechanisms by which metabolic energy, expressed largely by factors such as the ratio of carbon dioxide to lactic acid, guides both development and evolution. These ideas will have to take into account the actual resources of the world, as well as the internal processes and resources of the organism. Each development in the organism, whether it leads to maturation or to degeneration, consists of responses to and interactions with specific environments.Curiosity, esthetics, creativity, and stimulation are necessarily and deeply linked to metabolic efficiency and\r\nstructural-anatomical development. For example, the known effects of stimulation and success (or isolation and depression) on brain anatomy and function should be linked meaningfully with metabolic, hormonal and dietary processes. There is a large amount of information available that could be put to practical use, but there are still important ideological barriers to be overcome. Marshalling the information needed to optimize our own development runs counter to the program of our technical-scientific culture, which prefers to believe that degeneration is programmed, while emergent evolution is unforeseeable. But, if an optimization project is presented as a way to forestall the \"programmed degeneration,\" it might succeed in becoming part of the culture.Vernadsky's idea of the Noosphere differs from the Gaia\r\nhypothesis (that the world is a self-regulating organism-like system) in the intrinsic directionality of Vernadsky's Noosphere, which makes the course of human society crucial for the fate of the planet. It proposes that planets, like organisms, are going somewhere. The Gaia hypothesis is increasingly being interpreted as a justification for feeling no responsibility for the effects of technology on the environment, and some people are expressing that view of the world as essentially a justification for any vandalism that may come along. Kary Mullis, for example, says that mass extinctions of organisms have occurred in the past, and so it's just natural for species to become extinct, and it isn't appropriate to be concerned about the extinctions that are being caused by civilization's technological depredations.In the Noosphere, global warming and increased carbon dioxide would represent an advance toward a higher state of \"metabolism\" of the world, and this would support the emergence of new biological forms from those existing. But if whole systems of life are destroyed before that happens, the biological achievements of the past could be lost irretrievably; there is no guarantee that the system will continue to work, if major sectors are deleted from the interacting systems. Even in terms of the Gaia conception, that the earth is like an organism, consider what the loss of genetic complexity means for an organism. Sometimes, for example, things that happen to an individual lead to sterility several generations later, although the procedure didn't seem lethal for the individual or its immediate descendants.The whole idea of \"evolution\" is that the past is preserved within the present, or that the present is built upon the accomplishments of the past. The idea that evolution has been \"random,\" and that the world is simply self-regulating, might seem liberating to those who hate the idea that they might be intrinsically responsible for anything outside of themselves, but it is liberating only in the way that a vandal's manifesto might be, declaring the world to be their playground.The problem with such a manifesto of irresponsibility is simply that it is built upon the same system of cultural assumptions that produced Nazi eugenics, and that those assumptions are false. The political assumptions of the people who controlled scientific institutions were built into a set of pseudo-scientific doctrines,\r\nwhich continue to be valued for their political and philosophical implications.For hundreds or thousands of years, the therapeutic value of carbonated mineral springs has been known. The belief that it was the water's lively gas content that made it therapeutic led Joseph Priestley to investigate ways to make artificially carbonated water, and in the process he discovered oxygen. Carbonated water had its medical vogue in the 19th century, but the modern medical establishment has chosen to define itself in a way that glorifies \"dangerous,\" \"powerful\" treatments, and ridicules \"natural\" and mild approaches. The motivation is obvious--to maintain a monopoly, there must be some reason to exclude the general public from \"the practice of medicine.\" Witch doctors maintained their monopoly by working with frightening\r\nghost-powers, and modern medicine uses its technical mystifications to the same purpose.vAlthough the medical profession hasn't lost its legal monopoly on health care, corporate interests have come to control the way medicine is practiced, and the way research is done in all the fields related to medicine.The fact that carbon dioxide therapy is extremely safe has led to the official doctrine that it can't be effective. The results reviewed by Yandell Henderson in the Cyclopedia of Medicine in 1940 were so impressive that carbon dioxide therapy would have been as commonly used and as well known as oxygen therapy, radiation treatments, sulfa drugs, barbiturates, and\r\ndigitalis, but it was completely lacking in the thrilling mystique of those dangerous treatments.Henderson assumed that carbon dioxide use was becoming a permanent part of medicine, to be used with anesthesia to prevent cessation of spontaneous breathing, during recovery from surgery to prevent shock and pneumonia, for stimulating respiration in newborns, and for resuscitating drowning or suffocation victims, as well as for treatment of heart disease and some neurological conditions (see below). However, its use in surgery and resuscitation has probably decreased since he wrote, despite occasional publications pointing out the dangers involved in the use of oxygen without carbon dioxide.REFERENCES © Ray Peat Ph.D. 2012.

Extremely serious mistakes about brain \"transmitters\" and \"receptors\" didn't matter too much until the drug\r\nindustry got involved.\"Three years before Prozac received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in late 1987, the German BGA, that country's FDA equivalent, had such serious reservations about Prozac's safety that it refused to approve the antidepressant based on Lilly's studies showing that previously nonsuicidal patients who took the drug had a fivefold higher rate of suicides and suicide attempts than those on older antidepressants, and a threefold higher rate than\r\nthose taking placebos.\"\"Using figures on Prozac both from Lilly and independent research, however, Dr. David Healy, an expert on the brain's serotonin system and director of the North Wales Department of Psychological Medicine at the University of Wales, estimated that \"probably 50,000 people have committed suicide on Prozac since its launch, over and above the number who would have done so if left untreated.\"The Boston Globe, 2000.Anyone who has been reading the mass media and watching television in recent decades is familiar with the use of tryptophan as an antidepressant. Tryptophan is easily converted to serotonin and melatonin in the body. The most popular kind of antidepressant, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is said to act by increasing the action of serotonin in the brain. Many people have read articles in popular science magazines explaining that a deficiency of serotonin can cause depression, suicide, and aggression. Estrogen is often said to achieve its wonderful effects by increasing the effects of serotonin.Reserpine is an ancient tranquilizer, derived from a plant used in India for centuries. It has a powerful tranquilizing action, has been used to treat hypertension, and was found to be an antidepressant (Davies and Shepherd, 1955). It lowers the concentration of serotonin in the brain and other tissues. Isoniazid, an antidepressant that came into use in the 1950s, is effective, but it probably has no effect on serotonin. When those drugs were popular, serotonin wasnt recognized as a neurotransmitter.  It wasnt until the 1960s that our present set of doctrines regarding serotonins effects on mood and behavior came into being.Serotonin research is relatively new, but it rivals estrogen research for the level of incompetence and apparent fraudulent intent that can be found in professional publications.This is partly because of the involvement of the drug industry, but the U.S. government also played a role in setting a pattern of confused and perverse interpretation of serotonin physiology, by its policy of denigrating and incriminating LSD, a powerful serotonin (approximate) antagonist, by any means possible, for example claiming that it causes genetic damage and provokes homicidal or suicidal violence. The issue of genetic damage was already disproved in the 1960s, but this was never publicly acknowledged by the National Institutes of Mental Health or other government agency. The governments irresponsible actions helped to create the drug culture, in which health warnings about drugs were widely disregarded, because the government had been caught in blatant fraud. In more recent years, government warnings about tryptophan supplements have been widely dismissed, because the government has so often lied. Even when the public health agencies try to do something right, they fail, because they have done so much wrong.In animal studies LSD, and other anti-serotonin agents, increase playfulness and accelerate learning, and cause behavioral impairment only at very high doses. While reserpine was used medically for several decades, and was eventually found to have harmful side effects, medical research in LSD was stopped before its actual side effects could be discovered. \r\nThe misrepresentations about LSD, as a powerful antiserotonin agent, allowed a set of cultural stereotypes about serotonin to be established. Misconceptions about serotonin and melatonin and tryptophan, which are metabolically interrelated, have persisted, and it seems that the drug industry has exploited these mistakes to promote the new generation of psychoactive drugs as activators of serotonin responses. If LSD makes people go berserk, as the government claimed, then a product to amplify the effects of serotonin should make people sane.The serotonin reuptake inhibitors are called the third generation of antidepressants. The monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, that came into use in the 1950s, are called the first generation.  When their patents expire on a generation of drugs, the drug companies find reasons for claiming that the new drugs are better. Every doctor in the country seems to know that the old MAO-inhibitors are dangerous because they can raise blood pressure if you eat certain kinds of cheese while taking them.In fact, statistics show that they are safer than the new generation of antidepressants.It is hardly possible for a physician to prescribe the most appropriate drug, because the medical licensing boards are thoroughly indoctrinated by the drug companies, to believe that the safest and most effective drugs are those whose patents are still in force.While it is true that the newer antidepressants increase the actions of serotonin, it is not true that this explains their antidepressant action. This is a culturally conditioned promotional construction. Since different antidepressants increase, decrease, or dont affect the actions of serotonin, a radically new kind of theory of depression and the antidepressants is needed. Theories based on transmitter substances and receptors are favored by the drug industry, but that kind of thinking is hardly better than the belief in demons and their exorcism. If an herbal tea cures depression because the demon doesnt like its smell, at least the patient never has to abandon a remedy because a tea patent has expired.In the world of neurotransmitters and receptors, there is ample room for the development of speculative mechanisms of drug action. Serotonin is regulated by the rate of its synthesis and degradation, by its uptake, storage, and release, and by its transporters, and its effects are modified by a great variety of receptors, by the number of these receptors, and by their binding affinities and competitive binders. Different receptors are defined by the effects of chemicals other than serotonin; this means that serotonin itself hypothetically gains some of the properties of every substance that shows some binding competition with serotonin. This complexity*note 1 has made it possible to argue that a given condition is caused by either an excess or a deficiency of serotonin.The drug companies like to call some of their new products SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, meaning that they dont indiscriminately  increase  all  the biogenic amines, the way the old MAO inhibitors supposedly did.  Every drug does many things, each a little differently, so its technically true to say that they selectively do this or that.  But the term antidepressant, as distinguished from tranquilizer, says that the drug is intended to relieve depression.  Injecting serotonin never does that, but sometimes adrenalin or dopamine does, and these SSRI drugs increase the activities of those other amines enough that those changes could explain the altered mood, if it werent for the need to speak of a new generation of drugs.  Injecting serotonin, or increasing its activity, can cause sedation, helplessness, or apathy, but these drugs have that effect only some of the time.  Therefore, they arent called tranquilizers.  If they were really selective for serotonin, they just wouldnt be antidepressants.  And chemicals that antagonize serotonin do seem to function as antidepressants (Martin, et al., 1992).  When an SSRI is used to treat irritability and aggression, it is appropriate to call it a tranquilizer.  When drugs are used empirically, without really understanding the disease or the drug, classifications, descriptions, and names are subjective.\r\nThe serotonin situation reminds me of the history of DES:  For almost twenty years, this synthetic estrogen was marketed for the prevention of abortions; then it came out as the morning after contraception/abortion pill. If increasing serotonin isnt the cure, then maybe decreasing serotonin will be the cure.To begin to understand serotonin, its necessary to step back from the culture of neurotransmitters, and to look at the larger biological picture.Serotonin and estrogen have many systematically interrelated functions, and women are much more likely to suffer from depression than men are. Serotonin and histamine are increased by estrogen, and their activation mimics the effects of estrogen. Serotonin is closely involved in mood disorders, but also in a great variety of other problems that affect women much more frequently than men. These are probably primarily energy disorders, relating to cellular respiration and thyroid function. Liver disease and brain disease, e.g., Alzheimers disease, are both much more common in women than in men, and serotonin and estrogen strongly affect the energetic processes in these organs. Liver disease can increase the brains exposure to serotonin, ammonia, and histamine. It isnt just a coincidence that these three amines occur together and are neurotoxic; they are all stress-related substances, with natural roles in signaling and regulation.There are good reasons for thinking that serotonin contributes to the nerve damage seen in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimers disease.The high incidence of multiple sclerosis in women, and its onset during their reproductive years, is well known. The number of brain lesions is associated with the ratio of estrogen to progesterone. Estrogen activates mast cells to release histamine and serotonin, and activated mast cells can produce brain edema and demyelination. Blood clots have been microscopically associated with brain lesions like those in multiple sclerosis, and the platelets in clots release neurotoxic serotonin.In Parkinsons disease, the benefits seen from increasing the concentration of dopamine could result from dopamines antagonism to serotonin; anti-serotonin drugs can alleviate the symptoms, and 5-hydroxytryptophan can worsen the symptoms (Chase, et al., 1976). Other movement disorders, including akathisia and chorea, can be produced by serotonin. In autism, repetitive motions are a common symptom, and serotonin is high in the blood serum and platelets of autistic children and their relatives.  Irritable bowel syndrome, another kind of movement disorder, can be treated effectively with anti-serotonin agents.  This syndrome is very common in women, with premenstrual exacerbations, when estrogen is highest.  One of the side effects of oral contraceptives is chorea, uncontrollable dancing movements.  Some research has found increased serotonin in people with Huntingtons chorea (Kish, et al., 1987), and positive results with bromocriptine have been reported (Agnoli, et al., 1977).The neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, for which progesterone is the precursor, facilitates the inhibitory action of GABA, which is known to be deficient in some disorders of mood and movement.  This suggests that progesterone will be therapeutic in the movement disorders, as it is in various mood problems.  Progesterone has some specific antiserotonin actions (e.g.,  Wu, et al., 2000).The serotonin reuptake inhibitors are presumed to have the same effect on the brain that they have on blood platelets. They inhibit the ability of platelets to retain and concentrate serotonin, allowing it to stay in the plasma. This uptake-inhibited condition is a model of the platelet behavior seen in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimers disease.Serotonin and its derivative, melatonin, are both involved in the biology of torpor and hibernation. Serotonin inhibits mitochondrial respiration. Excitoxic death of nerve cells involves both the limitation of energy production, and increased cellular activation. Serotonin has both of these actions.In hibernating animals, the stress of a declining food supply causes increased serotonin production. In humans and animals that dont hibernate, the stress of winter causes very similar changes. Serotonin lowers temperature by decreasing the metabolic rate. Tryptophan and melatonin are also hypothermic. In the winter, more thyroid is needed to maintain a normal rate of metabolism.Increased serotonin interferes with the consolidation of learning. Hypothermia has a similar effect. Since estrogen increases serotonergia, and decreases body temperature, these effects help to explain the long-observed interference of estrogen with learning.Although ammonia, produced by fatigue or liver inefficiency, creates torpor, it can also cause convulsions. It synergizes with serotonin, and both of these promote excitotoxicity.Serotonins other names include thrombotonin, thrombocytin, enteramine, and 5-HT, its chemical name (5-hydroxytryptamine). These historical names derive from its role in the intestine and in blood vessels. In 1951, it was discovered that enteramine and thrombotonin were a single substance, and its involvement in circulatory disease, especially hypertension and vascular spasms, was the focus of research.  (The increase in the number of cardiovascular events recently seen in the study of women using estrogen is what might be expected from something which increases serotonin dominance.) It causes vasoconstriction and vasospasm, and promotes clotting, when its released from platelets. Especially when it is released from mast cells, it is considered to be an inflammatory mediator, along with histamine. Edema, bronchoconstriction, immunosuppression, and joint swelling are produced by the release of serotonin from platelets or other cells. As inflammatory mediators, serotonin and histamine are directly involved in asthma, hives, gastrointestinal damage from alcohol, nerve cell damage, edema, and shock.The broadly protective effects of antihistamine drugs have been energetically exploited by the drug industry for fifty years. Why havent antiserotonin drugs been similarly emphasized?Research on LSD and its derivatives led to drugs such as bromocriptine, which oppose the effects of histamine and estrogen. Some of bromocriptines effects are clearly antagonistic to serotonin, though bromocriptine is usually called a dopamine agonist; dopamine is pretty generally a serotonin antagonist. Methysergide, a related drug with antiserotonin activity, is effective in protecting the brain from the effects of strokes. But there is a general disinclination to understand the broad biological meaning of these effects.I think the corrupt campaign against LSD played a large role in this:  If the therapeutic value of LSD and related drugs (e.g., methysergide) with expired patents,*note2 used as antiserotonin agents, became widely known, the existing system of power and profit would be threatened. The war on drugs has always had its ulterior motives,including justifying domestic and foreign interventions in issues that have nothing to do with drugs. And in the case of the serotonin/antiserotonin mythology, this war has been rewarding to the drug industry--Lilly makes over $2 billion annually on Prozac. Each suicide caused by Prozac would appear to be balanced by several hundred thousand dollars earned by the corporation. If the war on drugs were serious, this would be a good place to start. And in weighing what corporate punishments might be appropriate, this corporations financial support for universal capital punishment should be taken into account.  Many experiments have shown that estrogen is very important for aggressive behavior in animals, and estrogen promotes serotonins actions. Some research shows that increased serotonin is associated with certain types of increased aggressiveness, and antiserotonin agents decrease aggresiveness (Ieni, et al., 1985; McMillen, et al., 1987) but the clearest research has to do with the crucial role of serotonin in learned helplessness.\r\nLearned helplessness is a biological condition that is created by inescapable stress. In this state, animals that would normally swim for hours will stop swimming after a few minutes and allow themselves to drown. They simply dont have enough mental or physical energy to overcome challenges.In learned helplessness, the level of serotonin is high, and an excess of serotonin helps to create the state of learned helplessness.Serotonin activates glycolysis, forming lactic acid. Excess lactic acid tends to decrease efficient energy production by interfering with mitochondrial respiration.Heart failure, hypertension, muscle hyperalgesia (Babenko, et al., 2000), some panic reactions, and other maladaptive biological events associated with problems of energy metabolism, are promoted by excessive serotonin.Autistic children and their relatives have high concentrations of serotonin in their serum and platelets. Members of a family tend to eat the same foods and to share other environmental conditions. Prenatal hypothyroidism and various kinds of imprinting, including hyperestrogenism, could account for this. Some studies have reported that thyroid supplements help autistic children, and anti-serotonin drugs have caused improvement in both children and adults.Serotonin tends to cause hypoglycemia, and hypoglycemia inhibits the conversion of thyroxine into the active T3 hormone. Hypoglycemia and hypothyroidism increase noradrenaline, and autistic people have been found to have more noradrenaline than normal. These changes, along with the general hypometabolism caused by excess serotonin, seem to justify the use of a thyroid supplement in autism and other serotonin-excess syndromes.Overdose with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or with 5-hydroxytryptophan, which has effects similar to serotonin, can cause the sometimes fatal \"serotonin syndrome.\"  Symptoms can include tremors, altered consciousness, poor coordination, cardiovascular disturbances, and seizures. Treatment with anti-serotonin drugs can alleviate the symptoms and usually can prevent death.The serotonin syndrome has been reported in users of St. Johns wort as an antidepressant.\r\nSince the other large neutral amino acids compete with tryptophan for entry into cells, the branched chain amino acids have some anti-serotonin activity, and this could be a justification for their use by athletes, since tryptophan and serotonin decrease glycogen stores and reduce endurance.The only amino acid that has ever been found to be carcinogenic is tryptophan. Its ability to mimic estrogen in promoting the release of prolactin is probably responsible.A large carbohydrate meal increases the ratio of tryptophan to the competing amino acids, and it has been proposed that this can shift the bodys balance toward increased serotonin. In an animal study, bromocriptine, which shifts the balance away from serotonin, reduced obesity and insulin and free fatty acids, and improved glucose tolerance.All of these observations are easiest to understand in terms of the suppression of cellular energy. Serotonin, like estrogen, lowers cellular ATP and interferes with oxidative metabolism.Serotonin, like histamine, has its proper physiological functions, but it is a mediator of stress that has to be systematically balanced by the systems that support high energy respiratory metabolism. The use of supplements of tryptophan, hydroxytryptophan, or of the serotonin promoting antidepressant drugs, seems to be biologically inappropriate.Many of the symptoms produced by excess serotonin are also the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Thyroid, progesterone, and high quality protein nutrition are central to protection against the serotonin syndromes.  (Progesterone, like LSD, can inhibit the firing of serotonergic nerves, but an overdose, unlike LSD, never produces hallucinations.)One of the many actions of the \"SSRI\" (such as  fluoxetine, Prozac), which arent related to their effect on serotonin, is to increase the concentration of allopregnanolone in the brain, imitating the action of increased progesterone.  Following this discovery, Lilly got Prozac approved as a treatment for premenstrual syndrome.  Since the production of allopregnanolone and progesterone depends on the availability of pregnenolone and cholesterol, a low cholesterol level would be one of the factors making this an inappropriate way to treat PMS.If we think biologically, starting with the role of serotonin as a damage-induced inflammatory mediator, we can speculate that an infinite number of irritating substances will be serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  The particular history of the third generation antidepressants is one that should disturb our tranquility.SOME NOTES AND SOURCES*Note 1: I dont want to imply that the receptor theory is wrong just because it allows for the introduction of innumerable experimental artifacts; it is primarily wrong because it is tied to the profoundly irrelevant membrane theory of cell regulation.*Note 2: Preparation for Lysergic Acid Amides: United States Patent Office 2,736,728 Patented February 28, 1956 Richard P.

Injection of serotonin\r\n(5-hydroxytryptamine) to rats, induced a dramatic fall in brain ATP level, accompanied by an increase in P(i). Concomitant to these changes, the activity of cytosolic phosphofructokinase, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, was significantly enhanced. Stimulation of anaerobic glycolysis was also reflected by a marked increase in lactate content in brain. 2. Brain glucose1,6-bisphosphate level was decreased, whereas fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was unaffected by serotonin. 3. All these serotonin-induced changes in brain, which are characteristic for cerebral ischemia, were prevented by treatment with the calmodulin (CaM) antagonists, trifluoperazine or thioridazine. 4. Injection of serotonin also induced a marked elevation of plasma hemoglobin, reflecting lysed erythrocytes, which was also prevented by treatment with the CaM antagonists. 5. The present results suggest that CaM antagonists may be effective drugs in treatment of many pathological\r\nconditions and diseases in which plasma serotonin levels are known to increase.J Neural Transm 1998;105(8-9):975-86.Role of tryptophan in the elevated serotonin-turnover in hepatic encephalopathy.Herneth AM, Steindl P, Ferenci P, Roth E, Hortnagl H Department of Internal Medicine IV, Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Vienna, Austria. The increase of the brain levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) suggests an increased turnover of serotonin (5-HT). To study the role of tryptophan on the increased brain 5-HT metabolism in HE, we attempted to monitor brain levels of tryptophan in rats with thioacetamide-induced acute liver failure by intravenous infusion of branched-chain amino\r\nacids (BCAA). The effect of this treatment on 5-HT synthesis and metabolism was investigated in five brain areas. BCAA-infusions (1 and 2 gm/kg/24 h) increased the ratio BCAA/aromatic amino acids in plasma two- and fourfold, respectively, and lowered both plasma and brain levels of tryptophan. At the higher BCAA-dose all parameters suggesting an altered brain 5-HT metabolism (increased brain levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA, increased 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio) were almost completely normalized. These results provide further evidence for the role of tryptophan in the elevation of brain 5-HT metabolism and for a potential role of BCAA in the treatment of HE.Tugai VA; Kurs'kii MD; Fedoriv OM.[Effect of serotonin on Ca2+ transport in mitochondria\r\nconjugated with the respiratory chain].Ukrainskii Biokhimicheskii Zhurnal, 1973 Jul-Aug, 45(4):408-12.Kurskii MD; Tugai VA; Fedoriv AN.[Effect of serotonin and calcium on separate components of respiratory chain of mitochondria in some rabbit tissues].Ukrainskii Biokhimicheskii Zhurnal, 1970, 42(5):584-8.Watanabe Y; Shibata S; Kobayashi B.Serotonin-induced swelling of rat liver mitochondria.Endocrinologia Japonica, 1969 Feb, 16(1):133-47.Mahler DJ; Humoller FL.The influence of serotonin on oxidative metabolism of brain mitochondria.Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine, 1968 Apr, 127(4):1074-9.Eur J Pharmacol 1994 Aug 11;261(1-2):25-32.The effect of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists in isolated globally ischemic rat hearts.Sargent CA, Dzwonczyk S, Grover G.J. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, has been reported to protect hypoxic myocardium.

McEwen BS, Conrad CD, Kuroda Y, Frankfurt M, Magarinos AM, McKittrick C, Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology, Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021, USA.  Atrophy and dysfunction of the human hippocampus is a feature of aging in some individuals, and this dysfunction predicts later dementia. There is reason to believe that adrenal glucocorticoids may contribute to these changes, since the elevations of\r\nglucocorticoids in Cushing's syndrome and during normal aging are associated with atrophy of the entire hippocampal formation in humans and are linked to deficits in short-term verbal memory. We have developed a model of stress-induced atrophy of the hippocampus of rats at the cellular level, and we have been investigating underlying mechanisms in search of agents that will block the atrophy. Repeated restraint stress in rats for 3 weeks causes changes in the hippocampal formation that include suppression of 5-HT1A receptor binding and atrophy of dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons, as well as impairment of initial learning of a radial arm maze task.Because serotonin is released by stressors and may play a role in the actions of stress on nerve cells, we investigated the actions of agents that facilitate or inhibit serotonin reuptake.Tianeptine is known to enhance serotonin uptake, and we compared it with fluoxetine, an inhibitor of 5-HT\r\nreuptake, as well as with desipramine. Tianeptine treatment (10 mg/kg/day) prevented the stress-induced atrophy of dendrites of CA3 pycamidal neurons, whereas neither fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day) nor desipramine (10 mg/kg/day) had any effect. Tianeptine treatment also prevented the stress-induced impairment of radial maze learning. Becausecorticosterone- and stress-induced atrophy of CA3 dendrites is also blocked by phenytoin, an inhibitor of excitatory amino acid release and actions, these results suggest that serotonin released by stress or corticosterone may interact pre- or post-synaptically with glutamate released by stress or corticosterone, and that the final common path may involve interactive effects between serotonin and glutamate receptors on the dendrites of CA3 neurons innervated by mossy fibers from the dentate gyrus. We discuss the implications of these findings for treating cognitive impairments and the risk for dementia in the\r\nelderly.J Mol Cell Cardiol 1985 Nov;17(11):1055-63.Digitoxin therapy partially restores cardiac catecholamine and brain serotonin metabolism in congestive heart failure.Sole MJ, Benedict CR, Versteeg DH, de Kloet ER. The effect of therapeutic doses of digitalis in modifying neural activity has been the subject of considerable controversy. In earlier studies we reportedan increase both in serotonergic activity in the posterior hypothalamus and pons-medulla and in cardiac sympathetic tone in the failing cardiomyopathic hamster.In this study we examine the effects of doses of digitoxin, known to be therapeutic for hamster heart failure, on monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain and heart during the\r\ncardiomyopathy. Both digitoxin and ASI-222, a polar amino-glycoside which does not cross theblood-brain barrier, given either acutely (6 mg/kg ip) or chronically (2 mg/kg/day ip for 10 days), normalized the failure-induced increase in serotonin turnover in the pons-medulla but had no effect on the changes in the posterior hypothalamus. Digitoxin therapy also reduced cardiac and adrenal sympathetic activity partially restoring cardiac catecholamine stores. In order to more clearly define the pathways involved we measured serotonin (microgram/g protein) in 18 brain nuclei after 10 days of digitoxin or vehicle treatment.Heart failure was associated with an increase in serotonin in five nuclei: the mammillary bodies, ventromedial, periventricular and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, and the centralis superior nucleus of the raphe. Digitoxin therapy completely normalized the changes in the centralis superior and ventromedialis\r\nnuclei; neither congestive heart failure nor digitoxin affected serotonin levels in other nuclei. We conclude that there is an increase in activity in specific brain serotonergic nuclei in congestive heart failure. Digitalis reduces cardiac sympathetic tone and restores the changes in two of these nuclei: the ventromedial and the centralis superior.+2Brain Res 2000 Jan 24;853(2):275-81.Duration and distribution of experimental muscle hyperalgesia in humans following combined infusions of serotonin and bradykinin.Babenko V, Svensson P, Graven-Nielsen T, Drewes AM, Jensen TS, Arendt-Nielsen L.Eur J Pharmacol 1992 Feb 25;212(1):73-8.5-HT3 receptor antagonists reverse helpless behaviour in rats.Martin P, Gozlan H, Puech AJ Departement de Pharmacologie, Faculte de Medecine Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France. The effects of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, zacopride, ondansetron and ICS 205-930, were investigated in an animal model of depression, the learned helplessness test. Rats previously subjected to a session of 60 inescapable foot-shocks exhibited a deficit of escape performance in three subsequent shuttle-box sessions. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists administered i.p. twice daily on a chronic schedule (zacopride 0.03-2 mg/kg per day; ondansetron and ICS 205-930: 0.125-2 mg/kg per day) reduced the number of escape failures at low to moderate daily doses. This effect was not observed with the highest dose(s) of zacopride, ondansetron and ICS 205-930\r\ntested. These results indicate that 5-HT3 antagonists may have effects like those of conventional antidepressants in rats.Neuropharmacology 1992 Apr;31(4):323-30.Presynaptic serotonin mechanisms in rats subjected to inescapable shock.Edwards E, Kornrich W, Houtten PV, Henn FA. After exposure to uncontrollable shock training, two distinct groups of rats can be defined in terms of their performance in learning to escape from a controllable stress. Learned helpless rats do not learn to terminate the controllable stress, whereas non-learned helpless rats learn this response as readily as naive control rats do. These results implicate presynaptic serotonin mechanisms in the behavioral deficit caused by uncontrollable shock. In\r\naddition, a limbic-hypothalamic pathway may serve as a control center for the behavioral response to stress.Neurochem Int 1992 Jul;21(1):29-35.In vitro neurotransmitter release in an animal model of depression. Edwards E, Kornrich W, van Houtten P, Henn FA.  Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to uncontrollable shock can be separated by a subsequent shock escape test into two groups: a \"helpless\" (LH) group which demonstrates a deficit in escape behavior, and a \"nonlearned helpless\" (NLH) group which shows no escape deficit and acquires the escape response as readily as naive control rats (NC) do. The major finding concerned a significant increase in endogenous and K(+)-stimulated serotonin (5-HT) release in the hippocampal\r\nslices of LH rats. There were no apparent differences in acetylcholine, dopamine and noradrenaline release in the hippocampus of LH rats as compared to NLH and NC rats. These results add further support to previous studies in our laboratory which implicate presynaptic 5-HT mechanisms in the behavioral deficit caused by uncontrollable shock.Psychiatry Res 1994 Jun;52(3):285-93.In vivo serotonin release and learned helplessness.Petty F, Kramer G, Wilson L, Jordan S Mental Health Clinic, Dallas Veterans Affairs Medical Center, TX. Learned helplessness, a behavioral depression caused by exposure to inescapable stress, is considered to be an animal model of human depressive disorder. Like human depression, learned helplessness has\r\nbeen associated with a defect in serotonergic function, but the nature of this relationship is not entirely clear. We have used in vivo microdialysis brain perfusion to measure serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) in extracellular space of medial frontal cortex in conscious, freely moving rats. Basal 5HT levels in rats perfused before exposure to tail-shock stress did not themselves correlate with subsequent learned helplessness behavior. However, 5HT release after stress showed a significant increase with helpless behavior.These data support the hypothesis that a cortical serotonergic excess is causally related to the development of learned helplessness.Pharmacol Biochem Behav 1994 Jul;48(3):671-6.Does learned helplessness\r\ninduction by haloperidol involve serotonin mediation?Petty F, Kramer G, Moeller M Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Dallas 75216. Learned helplessness (LH) is a behavioral depression following inescapable stress. Helpless behavior was induced in naive rats by the dopamine D2 receptor blocker haloperidol (HDL) in a dose-dependent manner, with the greatest effects seen at 20 mg/kg (IP). Rats were tested 24 h after injection. Haloperidol (IP) increased release of serotonin (5-HT) in medial prefrontal cortex (MPC) as measured by in vivo microdialysis. Perfusion of HDL through the probe in MPC caused increased cortical 5-HT release, as did perfusion of both dopamine and the dopamine agonist apomorphine. Our previous work found that increased 5-HT release in MPC correlates with the development of LH. The present work suggests that increased DA release in MPC, known to occur with both inescapable stress and with HDL, may play a necessary but not sufficient\r\nrole in the development of LH. Also, this suggests that increased DA activity in MPC leads to increased 5-HT release in MPC and to subsequent behavioral depression.Stroke 1991 Nov;22(11):1448-51.Platelet secretory products may contribute to neuronal injury.Joseph R, Tsering C, Grunfeld S, Welch KM Department of Neurology, Henry Ford Hospital and Health Sciences Center, Detroit, MI 48202. BACKGROUND: We do not fully understand the mechanisms for neuronal damage following cerebral arterial occlusion by a thrombus that consists mainly of platelets. The view that certain endogenous substances, such as glutamate, may also contribute to neuronal injury is now reasonably well established. Blood platelets are known to contain and secrete a\r\nnumber of substances that have been associated with neuronal dysfunction. Therefore, we hypothesize that a high concentration (approximately several thousand-fold higher than in plasma, in our estimation) of locally released platelet secretory products derived from the causative thrombus may contribute to neuronal injury and promote reactive gliosis. SUMMARY OF COMMENT: We have recently been able to report some direct support for this concept. When organotypic spinal cord cultures were exposed to platelet and platelet products, a significant reduction in the number and the size of the surviving neurons occurred in comparison with those in controls. We further observed that serotonin, a major platelet product, has neurotoxic properties. There may be other platelet components with similar effect.CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis of platelet-mediated neurotoxicity gains some support from these recent in vitro findings. The concept could provide a new area of\r\nresearch in stroke, both at the clinical and basic levels.J.

Basal plasma insulin concentration was markedly reduced throughout the day in bromocriptine-treated animals without influencing plasma glucose levels. Bromocriptine reduced the daily peak in FFA by 26% during the late light span (p < .05). Thus, bromocriptine-induced resetting of daily patterns of SCN neurotransmitter metabolism is associated with the effects of bromocriptine on attenuation of the obese insulin-resistant and glucose-intolerant condition. A large body of corroborating evidence suggests that such bromocriptine-induced changes in SCN monoamine metabolism may be functional in\r\nits effects on metabolism.Eur J Pharmacol 1982 Jul 30;81(4):569-76.Actions of serotonin antagonists on dog coronary artery.Brazenor RM, Angus JA. Serotonin released from platelets may initiate coronary vasospasm in patients with variant angina. If this hypothesis is correct, serotonin antagonists without constrictor activity may be useful in this form of angina. We have investigated drugs classified as serotonin antagonists on dog circumflex coronary artery ring segments in vitro. Ergotamine, dihydroergotamine,bromocriptine, lisuride, ergometrine, ketanserin, trazodone, cyproheptadine and pizotifen caused non-competitive antagonism of serotonin concentration-response curves. In addition, ketanserin, trazodone,\r\nbromocriptine and pizotifen inhibited noradrenaline responses in concentrations similar to those required for serotonin antagonism. All drugs with the exception of ketanserin, cyproheptadine and pizotifen showed some degree of intrinsic constrictor activity. Methysergide antagonized responses to serotonin competitively but also constricted the coronary artery. The lack of a silent competitive serotonin antagonist precludes a definite characterization of coronary serotonin receptors at this time. However, the profile of activity observed for the antagonist drugs in the coronary artery differs from that seen in other vascular tissues. Of the drugs tested, ketanserin may be the most useful in variant angina since it is a potent 5HT antagonist, lacks agonist activity and has alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity.Eur J Pharmacol 1985 May 8;111(2):211-20.Maternal aggression in mice: effects of treatments with PCPA, 5-HTP and 5-HT receptor antagonists.Ieni JR, Thurmond JB. Drug treatments which influence brain serotonergic systems were administered to lactating female mice during the early postpartum period, and their effects on aggressive behavior, locomotor activity and brain monoamines were examined. P-chlorophenylalanine (200 and 400 mg/kg) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (100 mg/kg) inhibited fighting behavior of postpartum mice toward unfamiliar male intruder mice. These drug-treated postpartum females showed increased latencies to attack male intruders and also reduced frequencies of attack. In addition,postpartum mice treated with the serotonin receptor antagonists, mianserin (2 and 4 mg/kg), methysergide (4 mg/kg) and methiothepin (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg), displayed significantly less\r\naggressive behavior than control mice, as measured by reduced number of attacks.Whole brain monoamine and monoamine metabolite levels were measured after drug treatments. The behavioral results are discussed in terms of drug-induced changes in brain chemistry and indicate apossible role for serotonin in the mediation of maternal aggressive behavior of mice.Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 1987 Apr;335(4):454-64.Effects of gepirone, an aryl-piperazine anxiolytic drug, on aggressive behavior and brain monoaminergic neurotransmission. McMillen BA, Scott SM, Williams HL, Sanghera MK.Gepirone (BMY 13805), a buspirone analog, was used to determine the antianxiety\r\nmechanism of the arylpiperazine class of drugs. Because of the weak effects of these drugs on conflict behavior, isolation-induced aggressive mice were used as the antianxiety model. Gepirone, like buspirone, potently inhibited attacks against group housed intruder mice (ED50 = 4.5 mg/kg i.p.) without causing sedation or ataxia. Inhibition of aggression was potentiated by co-administration of 0.25 mg/kg methiothepin or 2.5 mg/kg methysergide. Gepirone had variable effects on dopamine metabolism and reduced 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) metabolism about one third after a dose of 2.5 mg/kg. In contrast to buspirone, which markedly increased dopaminergic impulse flow, gepirone inhibited the firing of most cells recorded from the substantia nigra zona compacta in doses of 2.3-10 mg/kg i.v. and the effects were reversible by administration of haloperidol. The common metabolite of buspirone and gepirone, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine, caused increased firing rates\r\nonly. Gepirone potently inhibited serotonergic impulse flow recorded from the dorsal raphe nucleus (88.3% after 0.04 mg/kg) and this effect was partially reversed by serotonergic antagonists. Both buspirone and gepirone displaced [3H]-5HT from the 5HT1a binding site in the hippocampus with IC50 values of 10 and 58 nM, respectively. Non-alkyl substituted aryl-piperazines displaced [3H]-5HT from both 5HT1a and 5HT1b binding sites. Thus, although gepirone may be a weak postsynaptic 5HT agonist, its primary effect is to decrease 5HT neurotransmission.In support of this conclusion was the observed potentiation of antiaggressive effects by blocking 5HT receptorswit small doses of methiothepin or methysergide, which would exacerbate the decreased release of 5HT caused by gepirone. These results are in harmony with reports that decreased serotonergic activity has anxiolytic-like effects in animal models of anxiety.Farmakol Toksikol 1975 Mar-Apr;38(2):148-51.[Participation of the serotonin-reactive brain structure in certain forms of behavior in golden hamsters].Popova NK, Bertogaeva VD.A viviacious play of young hamsters is shown to be accompanied by a drop of the serotonin level in the brain stem and the subsequent slumber - by its rise, while the corticosteroids content of the peripheral blood with the playful behavior experiences no changes.Iprazid and 5-oxytryptophan inhibit the playful activity,while dioxyphenylalanina (DOPA) does not influence it. A similar depression of the serotonin level in the brain stem was also noted in an aggressive behavior and stress conditions arising when adult male-hamsters are grouped together. A\r\nconclusion is drawn to the effect that changes in the content of serotonin in the brain stem arenot associated with the emotional colouration of the condition, but rather reflect the transition from the somnolence to a highly active behavior.Biol Psychiatry 1985 Sep;20(9):1023-5Triiodothyronine-induced reversal of learned helplessness in rats.Martin P, Brochet D, Soubrie P, Simon P. © Ray Peat Ph.D. 2012.

They suggest that the difference in performance of \r\nchimpanzees and children may be due toa greater susceptibility of children to cultural conventions. (Horner \r\nand Whiten, 2005; Whiten, et al., 2004). In \r\nmy newsletter on puberty, I described some of the effects of foods and \r\nhormones on intelligence. Here, I want to consider the effects of culture \r\non the way people learn and think. Culture, it seems, starts to make \r\nus stupid long before the metabolic problems appear. For \r\nmany years I described culture as the perceived limits of possibility, \r\nbut people usually prefer to think of it as the learned rules of conduct \r\nin a society. In the late 1950s I was talking with a psychologist about \r\nthe nature of mental maps, and I said that I found my way around \r\ncampus by reference to mental pictures of the locations of things, and \r\nhe said that his method was to follow a series of rules, go out the \r\nfront door and turn left, turn left at the first corner, walk three \r\nblocks and turn right, ....up the stairs, turn right, fourth office \r\non the left. He had been studying mental processes for about 40 years, \r\nso his claim made an impression on me. I \r\nthought this style of thinking might have something to do with the growing \r\ntechnological preference for digital, rather than analog, devices. The \r\ncomplexity and continuity of the real world is made to seem more precise \r\nand concrete by turning it into rules and numbers. Around \r\nthe same time, I found that some people dream in vivid images, while \r\nothers describe dreams as listening to someone tell a story. Several \r\nyears later, a graduate student of language philosophy from MIT \r\ntold me that I was just confused if I believed that I had mental images \r\nthat I could use in thinking. His attitude was that language, in its \r\nforms and in the ways it could convey meaning, was governed by rules. \r\nHe was part of an effort to define consciousness in terms of rules that \r\ncould be manipulated formally. This was just a new variation on the \r\ndoctrine of an ideal language that has concerned many philosophers \r\nsince Leibniz, but now its main use is to convince people that cultural \r\nconventions and authority are rooted in the nature of our minds, rather \r\nthan in particular things that people experience and the ways in which \r\nthey are treated. George \r\nOrwell, whose novels showed some of the ways language is used to control \r\npeople, believed that language should be like a clear window between \r\nminds, but knew that it was habitually used to distort, mislead, and \r\ncontrol. Scientific and medical practices often follow the authority \r\nof culture and indoctrination, instead of intelligently confronting \r\nthe meaning of the evidence, the way chimpanzees are able to do. Not \r\nso many years ago, people believed that traits were determined by \r\ngenes, and that the development of an organism was the result of--was \r\ncaused by--the sequential expression of genes in the nucleus of the \r\nfertilized egg. When B.F. Skinner in the 1970s said a gestating baby \r\nisn't influenced by what happens to its mother, he was expressing \r\na deeply rooted bio-medical dogma. Physicians insisted that a baby couldn't \r\nbe harmed by its mother's malnutrition, as long as she lived to give \r\nbirth. People could be quite vicious when their dogma was challenged, \r\nbut their actions were systematically vicious when they weren't challenged. An \r\novum doesn't just grow from an oocyte according to instructions in its \r\ngenes, it is constructed, with surrounding nurse cells adding substances \r\nto its cytoplasm. Analogously, the fertilized egg doesn't just grow \r\ninto a human being, it is constructed, by interactions with the mother's \r\nphysiology. At birth, the environment continues to influence the ways \r\nin which cells develop and interact with each other. Even \r\nduring adulthood, the ways in which our cells--in the brain, immune \r\nsystem, and other organs--develop and interact are shaped by the environment. \r\nWhen Skinner was writing, many biologists still believed that each synapse \r\nof a nerve was directed by a gene, and couldn't be influenced by experience. Our \r\nbrain grows into our culture, and the culture lives in our nervous system. \r\nIf a person grows up without hearing people speak, he will have grown \r\na special kind of brain, making it difficult to learn to speak. (Genie, \r\nwolf boy, Kaspar Hauser, for example.) When \r\nwe ask a question and find an answer, we are changed. Thinking with \r\nlearning is a developmental process. But many people learn at an early \r\nage not to question. This changes the nature of subsequent learning \r\nand brain development. In \r\nthe 1960s, many textbooks were published that claimed to use scientific \r\nlanguage theory to improve the instruction of English, from grade school \r\nlevel to college level. They didn't work, and at the time they were \r\nbeing published they appeared fraudulent to people who didn't subscribe \r\nto the incipient cults of Generative Grammar and Artificial \r\nIntelligence that later developed into Cognitive Science. At \r\nthe time that Artificial Intelligence was coming to the attention of \r\ninvestors and academicians, Neodarwinism had already cleansed the university \r\nbiology departments of its opponents who advocated more holistic views, \r\nand the idea of a brain that was hard-wired according to genetic \r\ninstructions had entered both neurology and psychology. The field concept \r\nwas disappearing from developmental biology, as Gestalt psychology was \r\ndisappearing from the universities and journals. In \r\nthe humanities and social sciences, a fad appeared in the 1960s, in \r\nwhich a theory of grammar advocated by Noam Chomsky of MIT was said \r\nto explain human thinking and behavior, and specialists in anthropology, \r\npsychology, literature, rhetoric, sociology, and other academic fields, \r\nclaimed that it informed their work in an essential way. The rapid spread \r\nof a doctrine for which there was essentially no evidence suggests that \r\nit was filling a need for many people in our culture. This doctrine \r\nwas filling some of the gaps left by the failure of genetic determinism \r\nthat was starting to be recognized. It gave new support to the doctrine \r\nof inborn capacities and limitations, in which formulaic indoctrination \r\ncan be justified by the brain's natural structure. Chomsky \r\nwas committed to an idealistic, rationalist doctrine of innate \r\nideas, and to argue for that doctrine, which held that there are transcendent \r\nforms (or deep structures) that control mind, he disposed of the \r\nopposing empiricist approach to mind by claiming that children \r\nsimply learn language so rapidly that it would be impossible to explain \r\non the basis of learning from experience. Separating vocabulary from \r\ngrammar, he acknowledged that each language is different, and can be \r\nlearned as easily by the children of immigrants of different ethnicity \r\nas by children whose ancestors spoke it, but that all humans have a \r\ngenetically encoded universal grammar, a language organ. \r\nIt is this inborn grammar that allows children to learn what he \r\nsaid would be inconceivable to learn so quickly from experience. The \r\nabstract, computational nature of the inborn functions of the \r\nlanguage organ would make a nice program for a translating machine, \r\nand the absence of such a useful program, after more than 50 years of \r\ntrying to devise one, argues against the possibility of such a thing. Since \r\nPlato's time, some people have believed that, behind the changing irregularities \r\nof real languages, there is a timeless, context-free language. In the \r\nlate 1950s, when I was studying language and the ideal languages \r\nof the philosophers, I realized that George Santayana was right when \r\nhe pointed out that each time an artificial language is used by real \r\npeople in real situations, it is altered by the experience that accrues \r\nto each component, from the context in which it is used. If real language \r\nwere the model for mathematics, then the values of numbers would change \r\na little with every calculation. Adults \r\nare usually slower than children at learning a new language, but they \r\ncan make the process much quicker by memorizing paradigms. With those \r\nmodels, they can begin speaking intelligible sentences when they know \r\nonly a few words. These basics of grammar are often outlined in just \r\na few pages, but listing irregularities and exceptions can become very \r\ndetailed and complex. The grammar that children use isn't as subtle \r\nas the grammar some adults use, and college freshmen are seldom masters \r\nof the grammar of their native language. There \r\nhave been various studies that have investigated the number of words \r\nunderstood by children at different ages. The \r\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute website says that  A \r\ndictionary with 14,000 words is a substantial book. The grammar used \r\nby a 6 year old person isn't very complex, because at that age a person \r\nisn't likely to know all of the subtleties of their language. There \r\nis no reason to assume that a mind that can learn thousands of words \r\nand concepts in a year can't learn the grammatical patterns of a language--a \r\nmuch smaller number of patterns and relationships--in a few years. Idioms \r\nand clichés are clusters of words that are frequently used together \r\nin the same pattern to express a stereotyped meaning. There are thousands \r\nof them in English, and some of them have existed for centuries, while \r\nothers are regional and generational. It is possible to speak or write \r\nalmost completely in clichés, and they are such an important part of \r\nlanguage that their acquisition along with the basic vocabulary deserves \r\nmore attention than linguists have given it. A mind that can learn so \r\nmany clichés can certainly learn the relatively few stereotypical rules \r\nof phrasing that make up the grammar of a language. In fact, a grammar \r\nin some ways resembles a complex cliché. Recognition \r\nof patterns, first of things that are present, then of meaningful sequences, \r\nis what we call awareness or consciousness. There is biological evidence, \r\nfrom the level of single cells through many types of organism, both \r\nplant and animal, that pattern recognition is a basic biological function. \r\nAn organism that isn't oriented in space and time isn't an adapted, \r\nadapting, organism. Environments change, and the organization of life \r\nnecessarily has some flexibility. A \r\ntraveling bird or dog can see a pattern once, and later, going in the \r\nopposite direction, can recognize and find specific places and objects. \r\nAn ant or bee can see a pattern once, and communicate it to others. If \r\ndogs and birds lived in colonies or cities, as bees and ants do, and \r\ncarried food home from remote locations, they might have a need to communicate \r\ntheir knowledge. The fact that birds and dogs use their vocal organs \r\nand brains to communicate in ways that people have seldom cared to study \r\ndoesn't imply that their brains differ radically from human brains in \r\nlacking a language organ. People \r\nwhose ideology says that animals use instinct rather than intelligence, \r\nand that they lack the language instinct, refuse to perceive animals \r\nthat are demonstrating their ability to generalize or to understand \r\nlanguage. Organisms \r\nhave genes, so a person could say that pattern recognition is genetically \r\ndetermined, but it would be a foolish and empty thing to say. (Nevertheless, \r\npeople do say it.) The people who believe that there are genes for \r\ngrammar believe that these mind-controlling genes give us the ability \r\nto generalize, and therefore say that animals aren't able to generalize, \r\nthough their instinctive behaviors might sometimes seem to involve \r\ngeneralization. In \r\nlanguage, patterns are represented symbolically by patterned sounds, \r\nand some of those symbolically represented patterns are made up of other \r\npatterns. Different languages have different ways of representing different \r\nkinds of patterns. Things \r\nare recognizable when they are far or near, moving or still, bright \r\nor dark, or upside down, because the recognition of a pattern is an \r\nintegration involving both spatial and temporal components. The recognition \r\nof an object involves both generalization and concreteness. Things \r\nthat are very complex are likely to take longer to recognize, but the \r\nnature of any pattern is that it is a complex of parts and properties. A \r\nname for a thing is a name for a pattern, a set of relationships. The \r\nmethod of naming or identifying a relationship can make use of any way \r\nof patterning sound that can be recognized as making distinctions. Concepts \r\nand grammar aren't separable things, semantics and syntax \r\nare just aspects of a particular language's way of handling meaning. As \r\na child interacts with more and more things, and learns things about \r\nthem, the patterns of familiar things are compared to the patterns of \r\nnew things, and differences and similarities are noticed and used to \r\nunderstand relationships. The comparison of patterns is a process of \r\nmaking analogies, or metaphors. Similarities perceived become generalizations, \r\nand distinctions allow things to be grouped into categories. When \r\nthings are explored analogically, the exploration may first identify \r\nobjects, and then explore the factors that make up the larger pattern \r\nthat was first identified, in a kind of analysis, but this analysis \r\nis a sort of expansion inward, in which the discovered complexity has \r\nthe extra meaning of the larger context in which it is found. When \r\nsomething new is noticed, it excites the brain, and causes attention \r\nto be focused, in the orienting reflex. The various senses participate \r\nin examining the thing, in a physiological way of asking a question. \r\nPerception of new patterns and the formation of generalizations expands \r\nthe ways in which questions are asked. When words are available, questions \r\nmay be verbalized. The way in which questions are answered verbally \r\nmay be useful, but it often diverts the questioning process, and provides \r\nrules and arbitrary generalizations that may take the place of the normal \r\nanalogical processes of intelligence. The vocabulary of patterns no \r\nlonger expands spontaneously, but tends to come to rest in a system \r\nof accepted opinions. A \r\nfew patterns, formulated in language, are substituted for the processes \r\nof exploration through metaphorical thinking. In the first stages of \r\nlearning, the process is expansive and metaphorical. If a question is \r\nclosed by an answer in the form of a rule that must be followed, subsequent \r\nlearning can only be analytical and deductive. Learning \r\nof this sort is always a system of closed compartments, though one system \r\nmight occasionally be exchanged for another, in a conversion experience. The \r\nexploratory analogical mind is able to form broad generalizations and \r\nto make deductions from those, but the validity of the generalization \r\nis always in a process of being tested. Both the deduction and the generalization \r\nare constantly open to revision in accordance with the available evidence. If \r\nthere were infallible authorities who set down general rules, language \r\nand knowledge could be idealized and made mathematically precise. In \r\ntheir absence, intelligence is necessary, but the authorities who would \r\nbe infallible devise ways to confine and control intelligence, so that, \r\nwith the mastery of a language, the growth of intelligence usually stops. In \r\nthe 1940s and '50s, W.J.J. Gordon organized a group called Synectics, \r\nto investigate the creative process, and to devise ways to teach people \r\nto solve problems effectively. It involved several methods for helping \r\npeople to think analogically and metaphorically, and to avoid stereotyped \r\ninterpretations. It was a way of teaching people to recover the style \r\nof thinking of young children, or of chimps, or other intelligent animals. When \r\nthe acquisition of language is burdened by the acceptance of clichés, \r\nproducing the conventionalism mentioned by Horner and Whiten, with the \r\nsubstitution of deductive reasoning for metaphorical-analogical thinking, \r\nthe natural pleasures of mental exploration and creation are lost, and \r\na new kind of personality and character has come into existence. Bob \r\nAltemeyer spent his career studying the authoritarian personality, and \r\nhas identified its defining traits as conventionalism, submission to \r\nauthority, and aggression, as sanctioned by the authorities. His last \r\nbook,The Authoritarians(2006) is available on the internet. Altemeyer \r\nfound that people who scored high on his scale of authoritarianism tended \r\nto have faulty reasoning, with compartmentalized thinking, making it \r\npossible to hold contradictory beliefs, and to be dogmatic, hypocritical, \r\nand hostile. Since \r\nhe is looking at a spectrum, focusing on differences, I think he is \r\nlikely to have underestimated the degree to which these traits exist \r\nin the mainstream, and in groups such as scientists, that have a professional \r\ncommitment to clear reasoning and objectivity. With careful training, \r\nand in a culture that doesn't value creative metaphorical thinking, \r\nauthoritarianism might be a preferred trait. Konrad \r\nLorenz (who with Niko Tinbergen got the Nobel Prize in 1973) believed \r\nthat specific innate structures explained animal communication, and \r\nthat natural selection had created those structures.  Chomsky, \r\nwho said that our genes create an innate Language Acquisition Device, \r\ndistanced himself slightly from Lorenz's view by saying that it wasn't \r\ncertain that natural selection was responsible for it. However, despite \r\nslightly different names for the hypothetical innate devices, \r\ntheir views were extremely similar. Both \r\nLorenz and Chomsky, and their doctrine of innate rule-based consciousness, \r\nhave been popular and influential among university professors. When \r\nLorenz wrote a book on degeneration, which was little more than a revised \r\nversion of the articles he had written for the Nazi party's Office for \r\nRace Policy in the late 1930s and early 1940s, advocating the extermination \r\nof racial mongrels such as jews and gypsies, most biologists in \r\nthe US praised it. Lorenz identified National Socialism with evolution \r\nas an agent of racial purification. His lifelong beliefs and activities--the \r\nloyalty to a strong leader, advocating the killing of the weak--identified \r\nLorenz as an extreme authoritarian. When \r\na famous professor went on a lecture tour popularizing and affirming \r\nthe scientific truth and importance of those publications, and asserting \r\nthat all human actions and knowledge, language, work, art, and belief, \r\nare specified and determined by genes, he and his audience (which, at \r\nthe University of Oregon, included members of the National Academy of \r\nSciences and Jewish professors who had been refugees from Nazism, who \r\nlistened approvingly) were outraged when a student mentioned the Nazi \r\norigin and intention of the original publications. They \r\nsaid you can't say that a man's work has anything to do with his \r\nlife and political beliefs, but in fact the lecturer had just finished \r\nsaying that everything a person does is integral to that person's deepest \r\nnature, just as Lorenz said that a goose with a pot belly and odd beak, \r\nor a person with non-nordic physical features and behavior and cultural \r\npreferences--should be eliminated for the improvement of the species. \r\nNot a single professor in the audience questioned the science that had \r\njustified Hitler's racial policies, and some of them showed great hostility \r\ntoward the critic. In \r\nthe 1960s, a professor compared graduate students' scores on the Miller \r\nAnalogies Test, which is a widely used test of analogical thinking ability, \r\nto their academic grades. She found that the students who scored close \r\nto the average on the test had the highest grades and the greatest academic \r\nsuccess, and those who deviated the most from the average on that test, \r\nin either direction, had the worst academic grades. If the ability to \r\nthink analogically is inversely associated with authoritarianism, then \r\nher results would indicate that graduate schools select for authoritarianism. \r\n(If not, then they simply select for mediocrity.) Although \r\nBob Altemeyer's scale mainly identified right-wing, conservative authoritarians, \r\nhe indicated that there could be left-wing authoritarians, too. Noam \r\nChomsky is identified with left-wing political views, but his views \r\nof genetic determinism and a nativist view of language learning, \r\nand his anti-empiricist identification of himself as a philosophical \r\nRationalist, have a great correspondence to the authoritarian character. \r\nThe nativist rule-based nature of Cognitive Science is just \r\nthe modern form of an authoritarian tradition that has been influential \r\nsince Plato's time. The \r\nfirst thing a person is likely to notice when looking at Chomsky's work \r\nin linguistics is that he offers no evidence to support his extreme \r\nassertions. In fact, the main role evidence plays in his basic scheme \r\nis negative, that is, his doctrine of Poverty of the Stimulus \r\nasserts that children aren't exposed to enough examples of language \r\nfor them to be able to learn grammar--therefore, grammar must be inborn. I \r\nthink Chomsky discovered long ago that the people around him were sufficiently \r\nauthoritarian to accept assertions without evidence if they were presented \r\nin a form that looked complexly technical. Several people have published \r\ntheir correspondence with him, showing him to be authoritarian and arrogant, \r\neven rude and insulting, if the person questioned his handling of evidence, \r\nor the lack of evidence. For \r\nexample, people have argued with him about the JFK assassination, US \r\npolicy in the Vietnam war, the HIV-AIDS issue, and the 9/11 investigation. \r\nIn each case, he accepts the official position of the government, and \r\ninsults those who question, for example, the adequacy of the Warren \r\nCommission report, or who believe that the pharmaceutical industry would \r\nmanipulate the evidence regarding AIDS, or who doubt the conclusions \r\nof the 9/11 Commission investigation. He \r\nsays that investigation of such issues is diverting people from serious \r\nissues, as if those aren't serious issues. And even if it's true \r\nthat the government was involved in the 9/11 terrorism, who cares? \r\nI mean, it doesn't have any significance. I mean it's a little bit like \r\nthe huge amount of energy that's put out on trying to figure out who \r\nkilled John F. Kennedy. I mean, who knows, and who caresplenty of \r\npeople get killed all the time. Why does it matter that one of them \r\nhappens to be John F. Kennedy?\" \"If \r\nthere was some reason to believe that there was a high level conspiracy\" \r\nin the JFK assassination, \"it might be interesting, but the evidence \r\nagainst that is just overwhelming.\" \"And after that it's just \r\na matter of, uh, if it's a jealous husband or the mafia or someone else, \r\nwhat difference does it make?\" \"It's just taking energy away \r\nfrom serious issues onto ones that don't matter. And I think the same \r\nis true here,\" regarding the events of 9/11. These reactions seem \r\nespecially significant, considering his reputation as America's leading \r\ndissenter. The \r\nspeed with which Chomskyism spread through universities in the US in \r\nthe 1960s convinced me that I was right in viewing the instruction of \r\nthe humanities and social sciences as indoctrination, rather than objective \r\ntreatment of knowledge. The reception of the authoritarian ideas of \r\nLorenz and his apologists in biology departments offered me a new perspective \r\non the motivations involved in the uniformity of the orthodox views \r\nof biology and medicine. In \r\nbeing introduced into a profession, any lingering tendency toward analogical-metaphoric \r\nthinking is suppressed. I have known perceptive, imaginative people \r\nwho, after a year or two in medical school, had become rigid rule-followers. One \r\nof the perennial questions people have asked when they learn of the \r\nsuppression of a therapy, is if the doctors are doing it to defend \r\nthe profitable old methods, how can they refuse to use the better method \r\neven for themselves and their own family? The answer seems to be \r\nthat their minds have been radically affected by their vocational training. For \r\nmany years, cancer and inflammation have been known to be closely associated, \r\neven to be aspects of a single process. This was obvious to analog \r\nminded people, but seemed utterly improbable to the essentialist \r\nmentality, because of the indoctrination that inflammation is a good \r\nthing, that couldn't coexist with a bad thing like cancer. The \r\nphilosophy of language might seem remote from politics and practical \r\nproblems, but Kings and advertisers have understood that words and ideas \r\nare powerfully influential in maintaining relationships of power. Theories \r\nof mind and language that justify arbitrary power, power that can't \r\njustify itself in terms of evidence, are more dangerous than merely \r\nmistaken scientific theories, because any theory that bases its arguments \r\non evidence is capable of being disproved. In \r\nthe middle ages, the Divine Right of Kings was derived from certain \r\nkinds of theological reasoning. It has been replaced by newer ideologies, \r\nbased on deductions from beliefs about the nature of mind and matter, \r\nwords and genes, Computational Grammar, or numbers and quantized \r\nenergy, but behind the ideology is the reality of the authoritarian \r\npersonality. I \r\nthink if we understand more about the nature of language and its acquisition \r\nwe will have a clearer picture of what is happening in our cultures, \r\nespecially in the culture of science.

Rather than studying the regeneration of organs and tissues, \r\nand recognizing its obvious importance in healing as well as in understanding \r\nthe nature of life, much of the last century was devoted to the defamation \r\nof the researchers who were making real process in the field. Despite \r\nmany demonstrations that regeneration can occur in adult mammals, students \r\nwere taught that it happens only in lower vertebrates. I think it's \r\nimportant to look closely at the ideology responsible for this great \r\nloss. Warburg \r\nand Szent-Gyorgyi, in thinking about cancer, emphasized that growth \r\nis the primordial function of all cells, and that the differentiated \r\nfunctions of complex organisms involve restraints of that primitive \r\nfunction, imposed by a system that has developed through time. Seen \r\nwith this orientation, regeneration is the spontaneous result of the \r\ndisappearance of restraint. The reproduction of a whole plant from a \r\ntwig, or clone, was a process known for thousands of years. Any part \r\nof the plant contains the information needed for making a whole plant. \r\nMore than thirty years ago, cells from a tumor were added to the cells \r\nof a normal embryo, and the animal that matured from the embryo-tumor \r\nmix was normal, and had traits of both lineages, showing that the tumor \r\ncells had retained the genetic information of a complete healthy organism, \r\nand just needed a different environment in which to realize their full \r\npotential. One \r\nof the currents of medical thinking, from classical times through Paracelsus \r\nto homeopathy and naturopathy, has been a confidence in the capacity \r\nof the organism to heal itself. But \"modern\" medicine has \r\narrogated to itself the \"healing power,\" with terrible results, \r\nmitigated only by their occasional reluctant acceptance of fragments \r\nof sane organismic thinking, such as recognizing the importance of nutrition, \r\nor of keeping sewage out of the drinking water. Research into methods \r\nto support the organism's natural restorative powers has been ridiculed \r\nand suppressed. We \r\nare immersed in the propaganda of modern medicine, and part of that \r\npropaganda involves the confabulation of a history of science that supports \r\ntheir practice and their ideology. The real history of science won't \r\nbe found in science textbooks. \"I intend \r\nto show you how neo-Darwinism has been invalidated within science itself, \r\nas an explanation of how life on earth has evolved and is evolving. \r\nIt is nevertheless still perpetrated by the academic establishment, \r\nif only because it serves so well to promote genetic engineering, a \r\ntechnology that has the potential to destroy all life on earth. Furthermore, \r\nneo-Darwinism reinforces a worldview that undermines all moral values \r\nand prevents us from the necessary shift to holistic, ecological sciences \r\nthat can truly regenerate the earth and revitalize the human spirit.\"                    \r\nMae-Wan Ho Mainstream \r\nmedical treatments are based on some fundamentally absurd scientific \r\nideas. The advent of experimental animal cloning and the industrialization \r\nof genetic engineering have undercut the most important biological doctrines \r\nof the 20th century, but the processes of critical thinking haven't \r\nmade headway against most of the traditional medical stereotypes. Cloning \r\nshows that all cells are potential \"stem cells,\" but this \r\nfact co-exists with the Hayflick doctrine, that says, essentially, that \r\nno cell is a stem cell. The \r\nideology of culturally significant \"intellectuals\"--scientists, \r\nprofessors, neurobiologists, linguists, philosophers, oncologists, geneticists--in \r\nthe US is deeply influenced by the dualism and mechanistic materialism \r\nof Rene DesCartes. The \r\ndenial that animals can think or understand language, the claim that \r\nbabies or animals don't feel pain, or that heart cells and brain cells \r\ncan't divide, or that somatic cells lack the genetic capacity to be \r\ncloned, or that they are intrinsically mortal, limited to a maximum \r\nof 50 cell divisions--these absurdities of 20th century biology and \r\nmedicine all resulted from an abject commitment to the mechanistic doctrine \r\nof matter and life promoted or invented by DesCartes. I \r\ndoubt that DesCartes really invented anything, because, by the evidence \r\nof his writing, he wasn't an intelligent man, but he placed himself \r\npolitically in such a way that his arguments were acceptable to many \r\ninfluential people, and they continue to be acceptable to authoritarian \r\nand elitist factions even today. In \r\nthe 16th and 17th century the cultures of England, Holland, and France \r\nwere increasingly dominated by business interests. People who had money \r\nto invest wanted to see the world as an orderly, predictable place, \r\nand they found that many of the ideas of the ancient Greeks were useful. \r\nMathematics was needed to calculate interest rates, insurance premiums, \r\nand, for the military, the trajectories of missiles. In an orderly world, \r\nallowance for a little random variation helped to save the perfection \r\nof the general rule. In \r\nthis environment, theological thinking began retrenching its doctrine, \r\nto make it more acceptable to the increasingly powerful commercial people. \r\nThe clockwork universe of DesCartes' time, in which a perfect world \r\nthat operated according to perfect natural laws had been divinely created, \r\ngradually became theologically acceptable during the 18th and 19th centuries. \r\nIn the 18th century, the Deists were the most famous embodiment of the \r\nidea, and then in the 19th century their place was taken by the Catastrophists, \r\nwho claimed that the fossils which seemed to show evolutionary change \r\nof species actually represented species that had been created along \r\nwith those now existing, but that had been destroyed by catastrophes, \r\nsuch as Noah's flood. By the end of the 19th century, the president \r\nof an American university recognized that theological compromises could \r\nprevent his undergraduates from rejecting religion entirely, and forbade \r\nsermons against evolution. There \r\nwere many biologists who insisted that evolution of new species was \r\nanalogous to the development of an individual, and that both revealed \r\nan adaptive capacity of the living substance. In this view, the adaptive \r\ngrowth of an individual in a new environment revealed novel solutions \r\nto new problems, and showed an innate inventiveness and intelligence \r\nin the process of growth and adaptation. The appearance of new species \r\nwas thought to represent the same sorts of adaptive processes. Erasmus \r\nDarwin (grandfather of Charles) was an evolutionist of this sort, but \r\nbecause of political and theological pressure, he kept relatively quiet \r\nabout his beliefs. There was an underground culture, in which an evolutionary \r\nview of the world was accepted, but these views were seldom published, \r\nbecause of increasingly stringent censorship. Because of censorship, \r\npoetry, letters, and diaries, rather than academic and scholarly works, \r\ngive us the true picture of 18th century and early 19th century scientific \r\nculture. The \r\nscientists who wanted their work to be acceptable to those in power \r\nfound ways to work with the Cartesian mechanical view of the world, \r\nbuilding on the Deists' compromise, which had succeeded in removing \r\nthe supernatural from nature. As the fossil evidence of evolution became \r\ninescapable, around the time of Charles Darwin's work, those who wanted \r\nto bring evolution into the mainstream of culture found that the Catastrophism \r\nof the creationists could be adapted to their purposes, with only slight \r\nmodification. The \r\ndoctrine of Thomas Malthus, who argued that war, famine, and disease \r\nwere beneficial for those who survived, by decreasing the competition \r\nfor limited resources, became a near equivalent to the catastrophic \r\nfloods that the creationists had invoked to explain the geological record \r\nthat contained evidence of many extinct animals.The doctrine of \r\nMalthus, like that of the Catastrophists, made loss, deletion, and destruction \r\ninto a central device for explaining the history of the world. Both \r\nof the Darwins had accepted the idea that many biological changes were \r\nadaptive, rather than random, but the new practical compromise doctrine \r\nintroduced the idea that changes were just \"random variations.\" \r\n\r\nThe essentially mechanical nature of the world was preserved, because \r\n\"chance\" occurrences could be dealt with, and didn't involve \r\nanything supernatural.The function of the environment wasn't to \r\nadd anything to life (that would have been to assert that there were \r\ncreative powers other than those of the Creator), but simply to eliminate \r\nthe inferior individuals that appeared as the result of random changes. Gregor \r\nMendel applied the principle of chance to explaining the inheritance \r\nof certain traits, and showed that \"traits\" were passed on \r\nunchanged, even when they weren't visible. His ideas were published \r\nand were acceptable to the scientific mainstream of his time. Traits \r\nwere determined by \"factors\" that were passed on, unchanged, \r\nfrom parents, and biological variation was explained by varied mixing \r\nof factors which in themselves were unaffected by the organism or the \r\nenvironment. Genetic determinism was safely compatible with creationism. Shortly \r\nafter Mendel's death, August Weismann began a campaign to put a stop \r\nto the claims of those who, like the Darwins and Lamarck, saw adaptive \r\ndevelopment of organisms as an essential part of the evolution of species. Weismann \r\nwas essentially a propagandist, and his first fame was the result of \r\n\"disproving\" Lamarck by cutting the tails off more than 1500 \r\nmice, and observing that their offspring were born with tails. The reason \r\nthe inheritance of acquired traits was impossible, he said, was that \r\nthe \"germ line\" was perfectly isolated from the rest of the \r\norganism. The differentiated tissues of the body were produced by the \r\nselective loss of information from the nuclei of cells in the embryo. \r\nThe cells of the germ line were immortal and contained all the information \r\nneeded to produce an organism, but no other cell of the organism was \r\ncomplete. Complexity \r\nwas produced by deletion, and this was the basis for arguing that, if \r\neven the development of an individual was nothing but a passive unfolding \r\nof inherited properties, much like unpacking a trunkful of clothes, \r\nthen there could be no adaptively acquired traits, and certainly no \r\ninheritance of something which didn't exist. Changes in an individual \r\nwere simply accidents, such as having a tail amputated, and so the whole \r\nissue of the origin of complexity was safely left to a primordial creation. Weismann \r\nand his arguments were famous in Europe and the US, and formed the background \r\nfor the ideas known as neo-Darwinism. His \"isolation of the germ \r\nline\" was the earliest version of the Central Dogma of molecular \r\nbiology, namely, that information flows only from DNA to RNA to protein. \r\nHis doctrine, of complexification through deletion, is the epitome of \r\nthe greatest dogma of modern times, expressed in doctrines from Catastrophism \r\nthrough the second law of thermodynamics and the theory of the Big Bang, \r\ndown to Hayflick's Doctrine of the mortality of somatic cells. All these \r\nare consequences of the Cartesian and Deistic separation of intelligence \r\nfrom matter. Regeneration \r\nis one of the most vivid examples of the intelligence of living substance. Given \r\na natural tendency of cells to multiply, the interesting thing about \r\nregenerative healing is the question of why the new growth of tissue \r\nsometimes differentiates to fit appropriately into its surroundings, \r\nbut sometimes fails to differentiate, becoming a tumor. With \r\naging, the regenerative process declines, and the process of tissue \r\nrebuilding slows. Against a background of reduced regenerative ability, \r\ntissue growth sometimes produces tumors, rather than renewed healthy \r\ntissue. When tumors are grafted onto the amputated tail stump of \r\na salamander, which has good regenerative ability, the tumor is transformed \r\ninto a tail, by its envirornment, or morphogenic field. The \"cancer \r\nproblem\" is essentially the problem of understanding the organizing \r\nforces of the organism. The aging problem is another aspect of the same \r\nproblem. Traditionally, \r\nbiologists had studied anatomy, physiology, embryology or development, \r\nand taxonomy or the classification of organisms. The growth of knowedge \r\nearly in the 20th century was suddenly seeming to confirm the physiological, \r\nadaptive view of organisms that Lamarck had held. C.M. Child, Joseph \r\nNeedham, Alexander Gurwitsch, and L.V. Polezhaev were demonstrating \r\nthe primacy of a formative process in biology. Polezhaev and Vladimir \r\nFilatov were studying practical means of stimulating regeneration as \r\na medical technique. Until \r\nthe beginning of the second world war, the study of regeneration and \r\nthe pattern-forming processes in embryology were the liveliest parts \r\nof biological research. Gestalt psychology was being developed at the \r\nsame time, with a similar emphasis on patterns and wholes. But \r\nWeismannism and neo-Darwinism, largely embodied in the person of the \r\ngeneticist T.H. Morgan, deliberately set out to kill that line of biological \r\nresearch. Gestalt psychology was similarly eliminated by the Behaviorists. One \r\nof Morgan's closest associates, his student and colleague A.H. Sturtevant, \r\nsaid that \"Morgan's objectives, what he was trying to get at in \r\ngeneral in his biological work was to produce mechanistic interpretations \r\nof biological phenomena. One of the things that irritated him most was \r\nany suggestion of purpose in biological interpretation. He always had \r\nsome reservations about the idea of natural selection, because it seemed \r\nto him to open the door to interpretations of biological phenomena in \r\nterms of purpose. He could be talked into the conclusion that there \r\nwas nothing that wasn't strictly mechanistic about this interpretation, \r\nbut he never liked it. And you had to talk him into it again every few \r\nmonths.\" (Sturtevant, A. H.,Genetics, Vol. 159,1-5, September \r\n2001, Copyright 2001, Reminiscences of T. H. Morgan.) Whatever \r\nhis motives, Morgan was known to have prevented his students (including \r\nC.M. Child) from publishing work that supported a holistic view of the \r\norganism. After Morgan's death, there was an intense and widespread \r\ncampaign to suppress any approach to biology other than the \"new \r\nsynthesis,\" neo-Darwinism, with its doctrine of mechanistic genetic \r\ndeterminism and its doctrine of random variation. A developmental biologist, \r\nJ.M. Opitz (1985), commented that\"in one of the most astounding \r\ndevelopments in Western scientific history, the gradient-field, or epimorphic \r\nfield concept, as embodied in normal ontogeny and as studied by experimental \r\nembryologists, seems to have simply vanished from the intellectual patrimony \r\nof Western biologists.\" Formative \r\nprocesses are necessarily multidimensional, and that makes calculation \r\nand analysis very complex. To a great extent, the geneticists were motivated \r\nto study bacterial genes, rather than vertebrate embryos, by the principle \r\nthat motivated the drunk to look for his car keys under the street lamp, \r\neven though that wasn't where he lost them, because the light made it \r\neasier to look there. Bacteria \r\nare easy to study because they lack the complexity that makes it hard \r\nto study an embryo or an animal. The language used in genetics textbooks \r\nshows not only that bacteria are treated by geneticists as if they were \r\none or two dimensional, but that the concepts developed for bacterial \r\ngenetics have been extrapolated to use in describing complex organisms: \r\n\"Genes interactto establish the body axis in Drosophila. \r\nHomeoticGenes controlpattern formation along the anterior-posterior \r\nbody axis.\" (Essentials of Genetics,M. Cummings and W. \r\nKlug, Prentice Hall, 2004.) One \r\nof the basic distinctions in embryology is in the way the cells divide \r\nafter the egg is fertilized. Oysters and earthworms have spiral cleavage, \r\nsea urchins and people have radial cleavage. Several decades ago an \r\nexperimenter was transferring a nucleus from an egg of an animal with \r\nradial cleavage, I think a sea urchin, into the enucleated egg of a \r\nsnail, with spiral cleavage. The nucleus transplanted across such a \r\ngreat difference in phyla didn't sustain maturation of the animal, but \r\nit did permit development to proceed for several rounds of cell division, \r\nand the pattern of cell division, or cleavage, and embryonic development \r\nalways followed the pattern of the phylum to which the egg cytoplasm \r\nbelonged, never the pattern of the phylum from which the nucleus was \r\nderived. The genes in the nucleus, obviously, weren't directing the \r\nbasic pattern formation of the embryo. One-dimensional \r\nbacterial genetics can be used to \"explain\" multidimensional \r\nsystems, but it can't be expected to make useful predictions. The \r\nidea of complexity, or of multidimensionality, has often been analyzed \r\nin terms of \"fields,\" by analogy with a magnetic field, as \r\nsome property, or properties, that extend beyond any individual part, \r\ngiving some coherence to the parts. Lamarck was concerned with understanding \r\nensembles of particles and cells, but in his time electricity and heat \r\nwere the only principles that physics provided that helped to illuminate \r\nthe nature of living organisms. At the end of the 19th century, though, \r\nthe physicist J.C. Bose was noticing that all of the properties of life \r\nthat had interested Lamarck and Buffon--irritability, sensation, contraction, \r\nmemory, etc.--had their close analogs in non-living substances. Bose, \r\nwho invented the radio detector that was the core of Marconi's apparatus, \r\nfound that, in the presence of an electromagnetic field, particles of \r\na substance, such as finely powdered metal filings, cohered into a unified \r\nwhole. An otherwise invisible, undetectable \"field\" which \r\nin Lamarck's time might have been known as one of the \"subtle fluids,\" \r\n\r\nwas able to organize a myriad of inert particles into a unified whole. In \r\nthe early 1920s, Bungenberg de Jong and A.I. Oparin showed how solutions \r\nof organic substances could spontaneously organize themselves into complex \r\nsystems, with differentiated parts. A Russian embryologist, Alexander \r\nGurwitsch, found that the parts of an organ or embryo could exert their \r\nstimulating or organizing influence on other cells even through a piece \r\nof glass, and by using different types of filter, he identified ultraweak \r\nultraviolet rays as a medium of communication between cells. F.-A. Popp \r\nand others are currently studying the integrating functions of ultraweak \r\nlight signals. Guenter Albrecht-Buehler (who has an interesting website \r\ncalled Cell Intelligence) is investigating the role of pulsed infrared \r\nsignals in cell communication. Electrical \r\nfields produced by cells, tissues, and organisms have been shown to \r\ninfluence cellular metabolism and physiology, and to influence growth \r\npatterns. Closely associated with cellular electrical fields are fields \r\nor gradients of pH and osmolarity, and all of these fields are known \r\nto affect the activity of enzymes, and so to create environments or \r\nfields of particular chemical concentrations. A \r\nphenomenon that was well known in the 1930s, when developmental fields \r\nwere still a familiar part of scientific discussion, was the \"cancer \r\nfield.\" Before a cancer developed in a particular area, the area \r\nshowed progessive changes, away from normal function and structure, \r\ntoward the cancer physiology. In \r\nthe embryonic state, damaged tissues regenerate quickly. The metabolism \r\nof an embryo or fetus is highly oxidative, converting glucose rapidly \r\nto carbon dioxide and water. Both carbon dioxide and water are important \r\nregulators of cellular metabolism and function, and the concentrations \r\nof both of them decrease systematically with maturity and aging. Both \r\nare involved with the most basic aspects of cellular sensitivity, responsiveness, \r\nand organization. To \r\nresume the scientific tradition that has \"simply vanished,\" \r\nI think we have to recover our ability to think about organisms generally, \r\nleaving aside as many of the concepts of genetics as possible (such \r\nas \"gene,\" \"operon,\" \"receptor\"; \"the \r\ngene\" has never been more than an ideological artifact), because \r\nthey so often falsify the most important issues. The organization of \r\ntissues and organs, and their functional properties, should be the focus \r\nof attention, as they were for Lamarck around 1800, and for Johanes \r\nMuller, who in 1840 saw cancer as a problem on the level of tissue, \r\nrather than cells. For Lamarck, sensitivity and movement were the essential \r\nproperties of the living substance, and J. C. Bose showed reasons for \r\nbelieving that the characteristics of life were built on related properties \r\nof matter itself. Sensitivity, \r\nthe ability to respond appropriately to the environment, is probably \r\na missing factor in the development of a tumor. The ability to become \r\nquiescent, to quietly participate in the ensemble of cells, is an essential \r\nfeature of the sensitivity and responsiveness of the cells of complex \r\norganisms. The factors that support organized appropriate functioning \r\nare the factors that help cells to inhibit the excitatory state. If \r\nthe keys of an accordion or organ didn't spring back after the musician \r\npressed them, the instrument would be unplayable. In extreme physiological \r\nstates, such as epilepsy or malignant hyperthermia, nerves or muscles \r\nbecome incapable of relaxing. Insomnia and muscle cramps are milder \r\ndegrees of a defective relaxation process. Excitoxicity and inflammation \r\ndescribe less generalized cases of a similar process, in which there \r\nis an imbalance between excitation and the restorative ability to stop \r\nthe excitation. Prolonged excitation, resulting in excessive fatigue, \r\ncan cause a cell to disintegrate, in the process of cell death called \r\napoptosis, \"falling away.\" In \r\nthe experiments of Polezhaev and Filatov, the products of cell disintegration \r\nwere found to stimulate the birth of new cells (possibly by blocking \r\na signal that restrains cell division). This process has been found \r\nin every organ that has been examined appropriately. It amounts to a \r\n\"streaming regeneration\" of the organism, analogous to the \r\nprogressive creation of Lamarck's view. G. Zajicek has demonstrated \r\nan orderly \"streaming\" renewal in several organs, and even \r\nthe oocytes (which in the Weismannian dogma were formed at a very early \r\nstage during embryonic development, and were perfectly isolated from \r\nthe cells of the mature body) have recently been shown to be continually \r\nregenerated in adult ovaries. \"Stem\" \r\ncells turn out to be ubiquitous, and the failure of regeneration and \r\nrestoration seems to be situational. In the 1950s a magazine article \r\ndescribed the regeneration of a finger-tip when the wound was kept enclosed. \r\nDecades later, friends (one a child, the other a man in his forties) \r\nhad accidental amputations of a finger-tip, down to the cuticle so that \r\nno visible nail remained. The boy's mother fitted his finger with the \r\ntube from a ballpoint pen, and the man used an aluminum cigar tube as \r\nhis \"bandage.\" Within a few weeks, their fingers had regenerated \r\nto their normal shape and length. I think the closed environment allows \r\nthe healing tissues to be exposed to a high concentration of carbon \r\ndioxide, in equilibrium with the carbon dioxide in the capillaries, \r\nand to a humid atmosphere, regulated by the osmotic or vapor pressure \r\nof the living tissues. Under \r\nordinary conditions, the creation of cells and the dissolution of cells \r\nshould be exactly balanced. The coordination of these processes requires \r\na high degree of coherence in the organism. Simple \r\nincrease of water in the vicinity of a cell increases its tendency to \r\nmultiply, as well as its excitability, and hypertonicity restrains cell \r\ndivision, and reduces excitability. Carbon dioxide, besides helping \r\nproteins to release water, appears to increase the ability of proteins \r\nand cells to respond to morphogenetic fields. Carbon dioxide is the \r\nmost universal agent of relaxation, restoration, and preservation of \r\nthe ability of cells to respond to signals. Progesterone is another \r\nvery general agent of restorative inhibition. The \r\nstudy of regeneration and \"stem cells\" is helping to illuminate \r\nthe general process of aging, and to provide very practical solutions \r\nfor specific degenerative diseases, as well as providing a context for \r\nmore appropriate treatment of traumatic tissue injury. In \r\naging, the growth and regenerative processes are slowed. There is some \r\nevidence that even cell death is slower in old age, at least in some \r\ntissues. Since animals with the highest metabolic rate live the longest, \r\nthe slowing rate of metabolism during aging probably accounts for those \r\nchanges in the rate of cell renewal. The continually streaming regeneration \r\nof tissues is part of the adaptive process, and it is probably intensified \r\nby stress. The \r\nability to sleep deeply decreases in old age, as a generalized inflammatory, \r\nexcitatory state of stress develops. With progressive weakening of restorative \r\ncellular relaxation (inhibition), cells become more susceptible to disintegration. \r\nIt's well established that bone loss occurs almost entirely during the \r\nnight, and since the catabolic hormones generally affect soft tissues \r\nas well as bones, the atrophy of soft tissues (\"sarcopenia\") \r\nof aging is also probably a process that occurs mostly during the night. \r\nMediators of inflammation are at their highest during the night (Cutolo \r\nand Masi, 2005). But during the period of growth, the length of bones \r\nseems to increase mostly during the night (Noonan, et al., 2004). My \r\ninterpretation of this is that the stress of darkness accelerates biological \r\nprocesses, whether the process is mainly constructive or mainly destructive. The \r\neffect of light supports efficient oxidative energy production, which \r\nsupports the protective inhibitory processes, by increasing ATP and \r\nCO2, and decreases the inflammatory mediators that intensify stress. \r\nIf organized cellular luminescence is required for a proper balance, \r\nthen the random luminescence produced by lipid peroxidation (which may \r\nbe more intense at night--Diaz-Munoz, et al., 1985), might be an important \r\nfactor in disrupting the balanced streaming of regeneration. Free radicals, \r\nwhatever their source, absorb a broad spectrum of radiation, and would \r\nblock luminous signals of all frequencies. Isoprene, produced mainly \r\nat night (Cailleux and Allain, 1989), is another ultraviolet absorber \r\nthat might account for nocturnal regulatory disorders. The \r\nage pigment, lipofuscin, is known to contribute to degenerative diseases, \r\nbut the nature of its toxicity has never been established. Its absorptive \r\nand fluorescent properties would be very likely to interfere with mitogenetic \r\nand morphogenetic radiation. Polyunsaturated fats are the main component \r\nof lipofuscin, and these fats in themselves can absorb ultraviolet light. \r\nWhen those fats are present in the skin, exposure to ultraviolet light \r\naccelerates the aging of the skin. Free fatty acids often increase during \r\nthe night, under the influence of hormones such as adrenaline and growth \r\nhormone. A \r\nsingle night of poor sleep probably causes significant anatomical damage \r\nto the streaming cellular systems that will be repaired over the next \r\nfew days if a high level of energy metabolism can be combined with a \r\nsufficient amount of deep sleep. The things that optimize energy and \r\nsleep form the background for supporting the restorative processes. \r\nSalt, glycine, carbon dioxide, progesterone, thyroid hormone and sugar \r\nall contribute to preserving the organism's energetic reserves by reducing \r\ninappropriate excitation. Lamarck's \r\nidea that organs developed or regressed according to their use or disuse \r\nwas often attacked by followers of the Weismann-Morgan genetic dogma. \r\nIn their view, the influence of the environment was limited to either \r\npreventing or permitting the realization of \"the genetic potential.\" \r\nOnce that predefined potential had been unfolded, the finite and mortal \r\nnature of the somatic cells didn't allow for any significant changes, \r\nexcept for depletion and death. One of the high points of Weismannian \r\nbiology came with the publication of an article in Science, around 1970, \r\nthat proposed to explain learning in terms of the lifelong loss of brain \r\ncells, beginning in humans around the age of 18 months, with a daily \r\nloss of 100,000 cells, which would record experience by selective deletion, \r\nthe way punching holes in cards had been used to enter data into computers. \r\nI was present to witness \"world class biologists\" taking that \r\nidea very seriously. As \r\nSturtevant mentioned in the quotation above, T.H. Morgan couldn't accept \r\nany attribution of purposefulness to organisms. In his genetic dogma, \r\nchanges were only random, and people who denied that were denounced \r\nas \"teleological\" (or metaphysical) thinkers. Changes occurred \r\nby deletion, not by meaningful addition. One \r\nof Pavlov's students, P.K. Anokhin, developed the concept of the Functional \r\nSystem in the 1930s, to explain the purposive behavior of animals. In \r\nthe 1950s, Anokhin integrated the endocrinology of stress and adaptation \r\ninto the concept, and F.Z. Meerson continued the work, concentrating \r\non the metabolic and structural changes that protect the heart during \r\nstress. The simplest view of the conditional reflex involves the adaptation \r\nof an animal to an external signal, identifying it as the occasion for \r\na particular action. Analyzing the Functional System starts with the \r\nneed of the animal, for example for food, and examines the processes \r\nthat are involved in satisfying that need, including nerve cells, a \r\nsense of hunger, knowledge of what things are edible, the muscles needed \r\nto get the food, and the digestive apparatus for assimilating it. When \r\nan understanding of stress physiology is combined with the idea of functional \r\nsystems, the adaptive meaning of the use or disuse of certain organs \r\nis given a concrete basis. Cortisol mobilizes amino acids from muscles \r\nthat are idle, and makes them available for the synthesis of proteins \r\nin the muscles, nerves, or glands that are activated in adapting to \r\nthe stress. The London taxi drivers whose hippocampus grows as they \r\nlearn the locations of the streets are very good examples of the processes \r\ndescribed by Meerson, Anokhin, and Lamarck, in which the use of an organ \r\nin meeting a need contributes to the development of that organ. The \r\nbalance between growth and regression is shifted during adaptive behavior. Exercise \r\nphysiologists, without mentioning functional systems, have recently \r\ndiscovered some principles that extend the discoveries of Meerson and \r\nAnokhin. They found that \"concentric\" contraction, that is, \r\ncausing the muscle to contract against resistance, improves the muscle's \r\nfunction, without injuring it. (Walking up a mountain causes concentric \r\ncontractions to dominate in the leg muscles. Walking down the mountain \r\ninjures the muscles, by stretching them, forcing them to elongate while \r\nbearing a load; they call that eccentric contraction.) Old people, who \r\nhad extensively damaged mitochondrial DNA, were given a program of concentric \r\nexercise, and as their muscles adapted to the new activity, their mitochondrial \r\nDNA was found to have become normal. There \r\nare probably the equivalents of constructive \"concentric\" \r\nactivity and destructively stressful \"eccentric\" activity \r\nin the brain. For example, \"rote learning\" is analogous to \r\neccentric muscle contraction, and learning by asking questions is \"concentric.\" \r\n\"No bird soars too high, if he soars with his own wings.\" \r\nAny activity that seems \"programmed\" probably stifles cellular \r\nenergy and cellular intelligence. When \r\nactivity is meaningful, and is seen to be meeting a felt need, the catabolic \r\nand anabolic systems support and strengthen the components of the functional \r\nsystem that has been activated. Everything we do has an influence on \r\nthe streaming renewal of the adaptive living substance. There \r\nare many therapeutic techniques that could be improved by organized \r\nresearch, for example, investigating the interactions of increasing \r\ncarbon dioxide, reducing atmospheric pressure, supplementing combinations \r\nof salt and other minerals, balancing amino acids and sugars, and varying \r\nlight exposure and types of activity. The dramatic results that have \r\noccasionally been demonstrated (and then suppressed and forgotten) are \r\njust a hint of the possibilities. If \r\nwe keep our thoughts on the living substance, the pervasive ideologies \r\nlose their oppressive power. REFERENCES © Ray Peat 2008. All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com^^^Top^^^",

It is the basic protective calcium blocker.Inflammation leads to excessive uptake of calcium by cells, and is a \r\nfactor in obesity, depression,  and the degenerative diseases.Protein deficiency is an important cause of deranged calcium metabolism. \r\nVitamins K, E, and A are important in regulating calcium metabolism, \r\nand preventing osteoporosis. Aspirin (with antiestrogenic and vitamin \r\nE-like actions) is protective against bone resorption and hypercalcemia.============================It is extremely important to realize that calcium deposits in soft tissues \r\nbecome worse when the diet islow in calcium.Persons suffering \r\nfrom arthritis, bursitis, scleroderma, hardening of the arteries and \r\nany abnormality where calcium deposits or spurs may cause pain are often \r\nafraid to eat foods rich in calcium. Actually they can never improve \r\nuntil their calcium and magnesium intakes are adequate. Not infrequently \r\nphysicians tell individuals with kidney stones to avoid all milk, thereby \r\ncausing stones to form even more rapidly. Such calcium deposits can \r\nalso occur when vitamin E is undersupplied. After open-heart surgery, \r\nwhen both magnesium and vitamin E are drastically needed and could easily \r\nbe given, the calcification of heart muscles often becomes so severe \r\nthat it can cause death within a few days. Pages 171-172,Lets Eat \r\nRight to Keep Fit,Adelle Davis, Signet, 1970.============================Almost all biologists think of the organism as a machine, regulated \r\nby information according to innate programs. When it comes down to the \r\ndetails, their explanations sometimes make Rube Goldbergs imaginary \r\ncontraptions seem elegant. At their best, they usually rely on some \r\nmysterious things called ionic pumps, that perform active transport, \r\npowered by little motors, under instructions from molecules that act \r\non their specific receptors. When things get unmanageable, the biologists \r\nspeak of paradoxes.Calcium is the most studied of all regulatory molecules, so it isnt \r\nsurprising that there is more than one calcium paradox. But there are \r\nways of looking at the organism, focusing on energy metabolism, that \r\ndont involve thead hoctheory of calcium pumps, and that make \r\nit easy to keep things in context.Ionized atoms and molecules behave in orderly ways, in relation to their \r\nsize and their electrical charge. Organic material, even when its dead, \r\nselectively binds certain metal ions, and excludes others. The living \r\norganism produces a stream of metabolic products, such as carbon dioxide \r\nor lactic acid, which interact specifically with each other and with \r\nthe metal ions, modifying their concentrations inside cells and in the \r\nbody fluids. This movement of ions can be called active transport, without \r\ninvoking the mysterious machinery of membrane pumps. Chemical changes \r\nproduced inside cells, for example by respiration, create different \r\nelectrical charges in different compartments (inside and outside of \r\ncapillaries, for example) which affect the movements of water and ions, \r\nby simple physical processes, not by molecular pumps.The result of these passive and active processes is that each kind of \r\nion has a characteristic concentration in each compartment, according \r\nto the metabolic energy state of the organism.Magnesium and potassium are mainly intracellular ions, sodium and calcium \r\nare mainly extracellular ions. When cells are excited, stressed, or \r\nde-energized, they lose magnesium and potassium, and take up sodium \r\nand calcium. The mitochondria can bind a certain amount of calcium during \r\nstress, but accumulating calcium can reach a point at which it inactivates \r\nthe mitochondria, forcing cells to increase their inefficient glycolytic \r\nenergy production, producing an excess of lactic acid. Abnormal calcification \r\nbegins in the mitochondria.When cells are stressed or dying, they take up calcium, which tends \r\nto excite the cells at the same time that it inhibits their energy production, \r\nintensifying their stress. A cramp or a seizure is an example of uncontrolled \r\ncellular excitation. Prolonged excitation and stress contribute to tissue \r\ninflammation and fibrosis.Gross calcification generally follows the fibrosis that is produced \r\nby inflammation.Arteries, kidneys, and other organs calcify during aging. At the age of 90, the amount of calcium in the elastic layer of an artery is about 35 times greater than at the age of 20. Nearly every type of tissue, \r\nincluding the brain, is susceptible to the inflammatory process that \r\nleads through fibrosis to calcification. The exception is the skeleton, \r\nwhich loses its calcium as the soft tissues absorb calcium.These observations lead to some simplifying ideas about the nature of \r\naging and disease.Some people who know about the involvement of calcium in aging, stress, \r\nand degeneration suggest eating a low calcium diet, but since we all \r\nhave skeletons, dietary calcium restriction cant protect our cells, \r\nand in fact, it usually intensifies the process of calcification of \r\nthe soft tissues. Statistics from several countries have clearly shown \r\nthat the mortality rate (especially from arteriosclerotic heart disease, \r\nbut also from some other diseases, including cancer) is lower than average \r\nin regions that have hard water, which often contains a very large amount \r\nof either calcium or magnesium.Many studies have shown that dietary calcium (or vitamin D, which increases \r\ncalcium absorption) can have very important antiinflammatory effects.About 25 years ago, David McCarron noticed that the governments data \r\non diet and hypertension showed that the people who ate the most salt \r\nhad the lowest blood pressure, and those who ate the least salt had \r\nthe highest pressure. He showed that a calcium deficiency, rather than \r\na sodium excess, was the most likely nutritional explanation for hypertension.Hans Selye found that some steroids contribute to inflammation and calcification. \r\nAnimals could be sensitized to develop calciphylaxis, an intense, localized \r\ninteraction of inflammation and calcification.In the 1970s, Constance Martin pointed out that, up to that time, estrogen \r\nwas known to increase soft tissue calcium, but hadnt been shown to improve \r\nbone calcification and strength.Oxygen deprivation, cyanide poisoning, x-irradiation, and all other \r\nsorts of injury also increase the calcium content of soft tissues.One of Selyes colleagues, G. Jasmin, showed that magnesium deficiency \r\ncauses inflammation. A deficiency of either calcium or magnesium can \r\nstimulate the parathyroid glands to produce more hormone (parathyroid \r\nhormone, PTH), which increases calcium absorption, but also removes \r\ncalcium from the bones. This hormone, responding to a dietary calcium \r\nor magnesium deficiency, is an important factor in causing cells to \r\ntake up too much calcium, and its excess is associated with many inflammatory \r\nand degenerative diseases.Interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory cytokine which increases with \r\naging, is commonly considered to have an important role in the multiple \r\nprocesses of atrophy in old age. One of the things which can increase \r\nthe production of IL-6 is the parathyroid hormone (PTH), which increases \r\nthe amount of calcium circulating in the blood, partly by causing it \r\nto be removed from the bones; IL-6 stimulates the process of calcium \r\nremoval from bones.Some of the interactions of hormones and other regulatory chemicals \r\nare interesting, even though they are normally treated as if they were \r\nparts of a machine that operates according to a hidden program written \r\nin the genes. Prolactin, which is increased under the influence of estrogen \r\nor serotonin, causes the body to lose calcium (drawing it from the bones), \r\nand it stimulates the secretion of PTH, which compensates for the calcium \r\nloss by increasing its mobilization from bones. Prolactins action on \r\nbone is at least partly by increasing IL-6 formation; IL-6 stimulates \r\nthe release of prolactin. Serotonin and IL-6 stimulate each others secretion, \r\nand PTH and serotonin each stimulate the others release..PTH (like estrogen and serotonin) inhibits cellular respiration and \r\nactivates glycolysis, lowering the ATP level and shifting the cells \r\nmetabolism toward the production of lactic acid rather than carbon dioxide. \r\nPTH also causes bicarbonate to be lost in the urine.Since the formation of carbon dioxide lowers the intracellular pH, and \r\nthe formation of lactic acid raises it (through the reaction of NADH \r\nwith pyruvate), the proteins in the cell become more strongly negatively \r\ncharged under the influence of oxygen deprivation, or under the influence \r\nof these hormones. In the cell with high pH and increased negative electrical \r\ncharge, the positively charged calcium ion is absorbed into the cytoplasm. \r\nThe calcium can enter from the relatively concentrated external fluid, \r\nbut it can also be released from acidic intracellular stores, the way \r\nserotonin is released by a disturbance of pH.There are several other pro-inflammatory substances, such as the cytokines, \r\nthat have a similar effect on cellular energy systems.The antimetabolic actions of PTH mimic those seen in aging and diabetes, \r\nand surgical removal of the parathyroid glands has been known to eliminate \r\ndiabetes. PTH can cause diuresis, leading to loss of blood volume and \r\ndehydration, hypertension, paralysis, increased rate of cell division, \r\nand growth of cartilage, bone, and other tissues.Simply eating an adequate amount of calcium and magnesium can alleviate \r\nmany problems related to stress and aging that are considered serious, \r\nsuch as heart arrhythmia, pancreatitis, and tissue calcification. The \r\nantiinflammatory, anti-allergy actions of calcium and magnesium are \r\nwell established, and there is clear evidence that obesity and various \r\nemotional disturbances can result from their deficiency. Chronically \r\nhigh PTH can produce anemia, by a variety of mechanisms.Since a very low sodium diet increases the loss of magnesium, by increasing \r\naldosterone synthesis, simply increasing the amount of sodium in the \r\ndiet can help some people to balance their minerals and minimize stress. \r\nDuring fasting and other intense stress, the kidneys destroy a large \r\namount of protein to form ammonia to maintain their ability to excrete \r\nacids, so using a large amount of the alkaline minerals can reduce the \r\nprotein catabolism.A diet of milk and fruit, or milk and meat, provides a nutritional balance \r\nwith generous amounts of calcium and magnesium. Leafy vegetables are \r\na very rich source of magnesium, but they are also a potential source \r\nof large amounts of lead and other toxins. In 1960, many people, including \r\nthe U.S.government, were advocating the use of a largely vegetarian \r\ndiet for children, because of the amount of radioactive strontium in \r\nmilk. I compared the amount of strontium in a diet of vegetables that \r\nwould provide the necessary quantity of calcium and protein, and it \r\nwas clear that vegetables were the worst source of radioactive strontium, \r\nbecause their ratio of strontium to calcium was much higher than the \r\nratio in milk. The cows were concentrating calcium and protein from \r\nthe contaminated plant foods, eliminating much of the strontium. This \r\nprinciple still applies to the toxins that are currently found in the \r\nU.S. food supply.Milk has many protective effects besides providing calcium.Many babies are being given milk substitutes (health food drinks) made \r\nfrom soy or rice, with terrible consequences. The same products used \r\nby adults have less disastrous effects in the short term, but are still \r\nlikely to contribute to degeneration and dementia.Much of the intracellular magnesium is complexed with ATP, and helps \r\nto stabilize that molecule. If cellular energy production is low, as \r\nin hypothyroidism, cells tend to lose their magnesium very easily, shifting \r\nthe balance toward the lower energy molecule, ADP, with the release \r\nof phosphate. ADP complexes with calcium, rather than magnesium, increasing \r\nthe cells calcium content.Increased intracellular calcium, in association with excess nitric oxide \r\nand excitatory amino acids, is involved in several neurodegenerative \r\ndiseases, including ALS, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, Huntingtons \r\nchorea, and epilepsy. Magnesium, nicotine, progesterone, and many other \r\nsubstances are known to protect against excitotoxic calcium overload, \r\nbut there is no coherent effort in the health professions to make rational \r\nuse of the available knowledge.Respiration and carbon dioxide are the basic antagonists of the PTH. \r\nAt birth, a baby has practically no PTH, probably because of the high \r\nintrauterine concentration of carbon dioxide, but within a few days \r\nthe PTH rises.Increased carbon dioxide favors bone formation, and decreased bicarbonate \r\nfavors the loss of calcium from bone (Canzanello, et al., 1995; Bushinsky, \r\net al, 2001). The use of sodium bicarbonate can stimulate bone formation.A low protein diet, similar to that eaten by a large proportion of women \r\n(0.8 g/kg of body weight) increases PTH, and so probably contributes \r\nto the development of osteoporosis and the diseases of calcification. \r\nIn an extreme protein deficiency, there is a shift towards inflammation, \r\nserotonin excess, and excessive clotting, which might be related to \r\nthe effect of the milder, more common protein deficiency. Many people \r\nadvocate a low protein diet, specifically to prevent or treat osteoporosis, \r\nbut the cultures that traditionally have had extremely high protein \r\ndiets, such as the Masai, are very healthy. Recent studies (see Bell \r\nand Whiting, 2002) are emphasizing the importance of animal protein \r\nin preventing osteoporosis.Traditional meat-eating cultures efficiently use the whole animal, including \r\nblood, skin, bones, and the various organs, rather than just the muscles. \r\nThat diet is favorable for calcium regulation, because it provides more \r\nvitamin A, D, E, and K, calcium, and gelatin, and less of the pro-inflammatory \r\namino acids, tryptophan and cysteine.Most loss of calcium from bones occurs during the night. PTH tends to \r\ncycle with prolactin, which increases during the night, along with cortisol \r\nand the other stress hormones. These nocturnal hormones probably account \r\nfor the morning stiffness seen in many rheumatic conditions, connective \r\ntissue diseases, and in aging.Progesterone, which increases the carbon dioxide content of the tissues, \r\nis remarkably able to inhibit the actions of most of the inflammatory \r\nand catabolic mediators, and to protect against degenerative calcification \r\nand osteoporosis. It also protects against abnormal clotting. PTH increases \r\nplatelet calcium concentration, and under some conditions can produce \r\ninappropriate coagulation.Aspirin inhibits the actions of PTH, helping to prevent the calcification \r\nof inflamed tissues, and it inhibits the loss of calcium from bones. \r\nAspirin decreases the release of IL-6.A protein called the PTH-related protein (PTHrP) has the same functions \r\nas PTH, but can be produced in any tissue. It is responsible for the \r\nhypercalcemia of cancer, and is apparently involved in the frequent \r\nmetastasis of breast cancer to the bones.With only a small change in the theory of the nature of a living organism, \r\nrecognizing the importance of the interactions of metabolites and structural \r\nsubstances, controlled by energetic metabolism, real progress could \r\nbe made in understanding disease and health. The most important calcium \r\nparadox is that medical journals (e.g.,International J. of Cardiology,Dec., 2002) are still promoting the idea that eating too much calcium \r\ncauses hardening of the arteries and other diseases of calcification.REFERENCES Biochem Biophys Res Commun  \r\n2001 Feb 23;281(2):277-81.17 beta-estradiol increases Ca(2+) influx \r\nand down regulates interleukin-2 receptor in mouse thymocytes.Azenabor \r\nAA, Hoffman-Goetz L.

Low calcium \r\nand vitamin D intake, short solar exposure, decreased intestinal absorption, \r\nand falling renal function with insufficient 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D biosynthesis \r\nall contribute to calcium deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, \r\nbone loss and possibly calcium shift from the bone to soft tissue, and \r\nfrom the extracellular to the intracellular compartment, blunting the \r\nsharp concentration gap between these compartments. The consequences \r\nof calcium deficiency might thus include not only osteoporosis, but \r\nalso arteriosclerosis and hypertension due to the increase of calcium \r\nin the vascular wall,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and senile dementia \r\ndue to calcium depositionin the central nervous system,and \r\na decrease in cellular function, because of blunting of the difference \r\nin extracellular-intracellular calcium, leading to diabetes mellitus, \r\nimmune deficiency and others (Fig. 6) Contrib Nephrol 1991;90:206-11.Calcium, parathyroids and aging.Fujita T Calcium is unique in its distribution in living organisms with \r\nan extremely high hard and soft tissue and extra- intracellular concentration \r\ngradient. Calciumdeficiency through stimulating parathyroid hormone \r\nsecretion tends to blunt such a difference by paradoxically increasing \r\nthe calcium concentration in the soft tissue and intracellular compartment. \r\nSince aging is associated with theprogressive aggravation of calcium \r\ndeficiency, such blunting also progresses with aging. The dysfunction, \r\ndamage and death of cells occurring in all diseasesis always associated \r\nwith a blunting of the extra- and intracellular calcium components. \r\nCalcium supplement especially with highly biologically available active \r\nabsorbable calcium, was associated with the suppression of parathyroidhormone secretion and the normalization of a such bluntingof intercompartmental \r\ndistribution of calcium examples in hypertension and diabetes mellitus \r\nwith evident improvement of clinical manifestations and laboratory tests.

Parathyroid hormone-related \r\nprotein (PTHrP) is a ubiquitous and highly conserved vasoactive peptide \r\nwhose role and regulation in normal physiology remain an enigma. Recently, \r\nwe demonstrated that low-dose endotoxin (LPS) induces intrasplenic, \r\nbut not systemic, levels of PTHrP; and that tumor necrosis factor, a \r\npro-inflammatory cytokine, is the major mediator of this effect. We \r\nhave therefore hypothesized that, with higher, lethal doses of endotoxin, \r\nPTHrP could be induced in multiple tissues to such a degree that it \r\ncould contribute to the lethality of septic shock. In response to a \r\nnear-lethal dose of endotoxin, PTHrP mRNA levels increased acutely in \r\nevery vital organ examined (spleen, lung, heart, kidney, and liver). \r\nCirculating levels of PTHrP also increased, peaking 2 hr after administration \r\nof high-dose endotoxin. Theseresults suggest that PTHrP belongs \r\nto the cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced during lethal endotoxemia \r\nthat is responsible for the toxic effects ofLPS.

Recent studies have also found a tendency to low serum \r\nand/or lymphocyte Mg levels in CaUr. Despite earlier studies demonstrating \r\nan inhibitory effect of Mg supplementation on experimental CaUr in animals \r\nand in spontaneous CaUr in humans, at least two properly controlled \r\nclinical trials of Mg supplementation have failed to demonstrate a beneficial \r\neffect on CaUr frequency. With regard to the skeleton, experimental \r\nstudies have shown that Mg depletion causes a decrease in both osteoblast \r\nand osteoclast activity with the development of a form of 'aplastic \r\nbone disease'. At the same time, bone salt crystallization is enhanced \r\nby Mg deficiency. Conversely, Mg excess impairs mineralization with \r\nthe development of an osteomalacia-like picture, and may also stimulate \r\nbone resorption independently of parathyroid hormone. Whether or not \r\nMg depletion may be a causal factor in human osteoporosis is also controversial, \r\nand there are conflicting reports as to the Mg content of osteoporotic \r\nbone. Small decreases in serum and/or erythrocyte Mg in osteoporotic \r\npatients have been reported, and one author has noted improved bone \r\nmineral density with a multinutrient supplement rich in Mg. The extant \r\ndata are sparse and indicate a clear need for more rigorous study.

Magnesium influences bone \r\nin different ways.It activates osteoblasts, increases bone mineralization, \r\nand enhances the sensitivity of target tissues (incl. bone) to PTH and \r\n1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3,Under certain conditions however, magnesium \r\ncan stimulate bone resorption. A more potent factor than magnesium is \r\nstroncium, which not only activates osteoblats but decreases the number \r\nof osteoclasts, thus abolishing bone resorption and enhancing formation.Bicarbonates are also favourable for bone.

        "chunk_html": "Cholesterol, longevity, intelligence, and health.The biological meaning of cholesterol is just starting to be explored.Everything that doctors know about cholesterol is wrong.New information about cholesterol is clarifying important issues in \r\nphysiology and pathology.Medical magazines and television stations like to propagate the idea \r\nthat cholesterol is bad stuff, and as a result, that cliche is known \r\nto almost every American. Recent journal articles have promoted the \r\nidea that \"the lower the serum cholesterol is, the better\" \r\nit is for the health of the patient.The theory that heart disease is \"caused by cholesterol\" has \r\ngone through several stages, and most recently the use of the \"statin\" \r\ndrugs has revived it in a radical way. One consistent theme for fifty \r\nyears has been that people should eat more polyunsaturated fat and less \r\nsaturated fat, to lower their cholesterol, and to avoid butter, cream, \r\neggs, and \"red meat,\" because they contain both saturated \r\nfat and cholesterol. Often, medical attention is focused on the fats \r\nin the atheroma, rather than on the whole disease process, including \r\nclotting factors, vascular spasms, heart rhythm, viscosity of the blood, \r\ndeposition of calcium and iron in blood vessels, and the whole process \r\nof inflammation, including the reactions to absorbed bowel toxins.Almost 100 years ago, some experiments in Russia showed that feeding \r\nrabbits cholesterol caused them to develop atherosclerosis, but subsequent \r\nexperiments showed that rabbits are unusual in responding that way to \r\ncholesterol, and that even rabbits don't develop atherosclerosis from \r\ncholesterol if they are given a supplement of thyroid (Friedland, 1933). \r\nBy 1936, it was clear that hypercholesterolemia in humans and other \r\nanimals was caused by hypothyroidism, and that hypothyroidism caused \r\nmany diseases to develop, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. \r\nThere was already more reason at that time to think that the increased \r\ncholesterol was a protective adaptation than to think that it was maladaptive.The strange idea that cholesterol causes atherosclerosis was revived \r\nin the 1950s when the vegetable oil industry learned that their polyunsaturated \r\noils lowered serum cholesterol. (Many other toxins lower cholesterol, \r\nbut that is never mentioned.) The industry began advertising their oils \r\nas \"heart protective,\" and they enlisted some influential \r\norganizations to help in their advertising:The American Dietetic \r\nAssociation, the American Heart Association, the US Dept. of Agriculture \r\nand FDA, and the AMA. Besides the early rabbit research, which didn't \r\nmake their case against cholesterol and might actually have had implications \r\nharmful to their argument (since Anitschkow had used vegetable oil as \r\nsolvent for his cholesterol feedings), the oil industry helped to create \r\nand promote a large amount of fraudulent and unscientific work.The death rate from heart disease in the United States began increasing \r\nearly in the twentieth century, and it reached its peak from about 1950 \r\nto 1975, and then began declining. During the decades in which the death \r\nrate was rising, consumption of animal fat was decreasing, and the use \r\nof vegetable oil was increasing. In the southern European countries \r\nthat have been said to show that eating very little animal fat prevents \r\nheart disease, the trends after the second world war have been the opposite--they \r\nhave been eating more animal fat without an increase in heart disease.The correspondence between heart disease and consumption of saturated \r\nfat and cholesterol is little more than advertising copy. If people \r\nwere looking for the actual causes of heart disease, they would consider \r\nthe factors that changed in the US during the time that heart disease \r\nmortality was increasing. Both increases in harmful factors, and decreases \r\nin protective factors would have to be considered.The consumption of manufactured foods, pollution of air and water, the \r\nuse of lead in gasoline, cigarette smoking, increased medicalization \r\nand use of drugs, psychosocial and socioeconomic stress, and increased \r\nexposure to radiation--medical, military, and industrial--would be obvious \r\nthings to consider, along with decreased intake of some protective nutrients, \r\nsuch as selenium, magnesium, and vitamins.But those harmful factors all had their defenders:Who defends \r\nsocioeconomic stress? All of the social institutions that fail to alleviate \r\nit. In 1847, Rudolph Virchow was sent to Poland to study the health \r\nsituation there, and when he returned, the highly regarded anatomist, \r\nphysiologist and pathologist announced that the Poles wouldn't have \r\na health problem if the government would stop oppressing them, and institute \r\neconomic reforms to alleviate their poverty. The reforms weren't made, \r\nand Virchow lost his job. Other harmful factors, such as seed oils, \r\ndegraded foods, and radiation, have specific, very well organized and \r\npowerful lobbies to defend them.Despite the growing knowledge about the dangers of polyunsaturated fats, \r\nmany medical articles are still advocating the \"official\" \r\nheart protective diet (e.g., \"...diets using nonhydrogenated unsaturated fats as the predominant form \r\nof dietary fat,\" Hu and Willet, 2002).Some dogs alertly look at the thing a person is pointing at, other dogs \r\njust sniff the pointing finger. The publicists who disregard the complete \r\nnutritional and ecological situation, to focus on cholesterol and fat \r\nin the diet, are like the finger sniffers.Recent articles in the medical and lipids journals are praising the \r\n1950 work of J. W. Gofman, and the 1914 rabbit studies of N. N. Anitschkow, \r\nas the research that revealed cholesterol to be the cause of heart disease. \r\nAnitschkow and his co-workers, however, understood that their experiment \r\nhadn't explained human heart disease, and John Gofman, about 50 years \r\nafter publishing his work on the lipoproteins, has done some large studies \r\nthat could be crucial in disproving the doctrine that has become almost \r\na national religion.He has shown that mortality from both heart disease and cancer corresponds \r\nvery closely to the population's exposure to medical services, and specifically \r\nto medical radiation. During the peak years of heart disease mortality, \r\nmedical x-rays gave very large doses of radiation with each exposure, \r\nand the population was also exposed to radioactive fallout from atomic \r\nbomb testing (explosions from 1945 to 1963 produced a peak of heavy \r\nfallout that persisted through the 'sixties and into the 'seventies).Around 1971, someone noticed that the commercial cholesterol being used \r\nin feeding experiments was oxidized, that is, it wasn't really cholesterol. \r\nComparing carefully prepared, unoxidized cholesterol with the oxidized \r\ndegraded material, it was found that dietary cholesterol wasn't necessarily \r\natherogenic (Vine, et al., 1998).Dietitians often recommend eating poached salmon, rather than \"red \r\nmeat,\" to lower cholesterol. Experimenters have measured the toxic \r\noxidized cholesterol in different foods prepared in a variety of ways. \r\nSteaming salmon produced several times as much oxidized cholesterol \r\nas frying it, because of the longer cooking time that allowed the polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids to break down, producing toxins such as acrolein and free \r\nradicals that oxidize the cholesterol and other components of the fish. \r\nThe toxic cholesterol content of the steamed salmon was much higher \r\nthan that of beef cooked at a high temperature.When oxidized polyunsaturated oils, such as corn oil or linoleic acid, \r\nare added to food, they appear in the blood lipids, where they accelerate \r\nthe formation of cholesterol deposits in arteries (Staprans, et al., \r\n1994, 1996).Stress accelerates the oxidation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids \r\nin the body, so people who consume unsaturated vegetable oils and fish \r\nwill have some oxidized cholesterol in their tissues. The constant turnover \r\nof cholesterol in the tissues tends to lower the proportion of the toxic \r\noxidized degradation products of cholesterol, but in hypothyroidism, \r\nthe use of cholesterol is slowed, allowing the toxic forms to accumulate.Many antioxidant nutrients act like a thyroid supplement did in the \r\n1934 rabbit experiments, preventing atherosclerosis even when extra \r\ntoxic cholesterol is given to the animals. People who eat seafood get \r\nmuch more selenium in their diet than people who eat nothing from the \r\nsea, and selenium is one of the extremely protective nutrients that \r\nprevent atherosclerosis in animal experiments with excess cholesterol.It is well established that several antioxidant nutrients are protective \r\nfactors in heart disease. The medical establishment has expended a great \r\namount of money and time in the last 60 years fighting the use of vitamin \r\nE or selenium for treating or preventing heart disease, though many \r\nphysicians now take vitamin E themselves. But people who study free \r\nradical chemistry recognize that polyunsaturated fats are highly susceptible \r\nto oxidation, and that saturated fats tend to slow their degradation, \r\nacting to some extent as antioxidants. Several experiments and observations \r\nhave shown that cholesterol itself can protect against damaging oxidation \r\nof polyunsaturated fats, protecting DNA and other vital components of \r\nthe cell. A consistent program to prevent the oxidation of cholesterol \r\nwould have to include all of the vitamins and minerals that are involved \r\nin antioxidant defense, avoidance of nutrients that exacerbate the destructive \r\noxidations, and an effort to normalize the hormones and other factors, \r\nsuch as carbon dioxide, that have protective effects against free radical \r\noxidation. A low level of cholesterol might increase susceptibility \r\nto the oxidants.The steroids in general, especially those produced in large amounts, \r\nprogesterone and DHEA, are important parts of the antioxidant defenses. \r\nCholesterol, either that produced internally by the cell, or taken in \r\nfrom the blood stream, is the precursor for all the steroids in the \r\nbody. Several of the major steroid hormones are antiinflammatory, and \r\ncholesterol itself is antiinflammatory. (Mikko, et al., 2002; Kreines, \r\net al., 1990). Cholesterol also protects against radiation damage, and \r\nmany forms of toxin (saponins, cobra venom, chloroform--W.G. MacCallum,A Text-book ofPathology,1937, Saunders Co.; many more recent \r\nstudies show that it protects blood cells against hemolysis--breakdown \r\nof red blood cells--caused by heat and other harmful agents; e.g., Dumas, \r\net al., 2002, Velardi, et al., 1991). Cholesterol, vitamin E, progesterone, \r\nand vitamin D are considered to be \"structural antioxidants,\" \r\nthat prevent oxidation partly by stabilizing molecular structures. One \r\nof the basic functions of cholesterol seems to be the stabilization \r\nof mitochondria, preventing their destruction by stress. Serious stress \r\nlowers ATP, magnesium, and carbon dioxide. When ATP and intracellular \r\nmagnesium are decreased, cholesterol synthesis increases.During stress, free fatty acids are released from the tissues, and circulating \r\nin the bloodstream they are highly susceptible to oxidation. They contribute \r\nto the formation of the age pigment, lipofuscin, which is an oxygen-wasting \r\nsubstance that's found in the atheroma plaques in the damaged blood \r\nvessels. Iron and calcium accumulation adds to the tissue damage.The hemolysis which is promoted by polyunsaturated fats and an imbalance \r\nof antioxidants and oxidants, releases iron and heme into the blood \r\nstream. The incidence of atherosclerosis is increased when the body \r\niron stores are high (Kiechl, et al., 1997), probably because of its \r\nrole in lipid peroxidation and lipofuscin formation.Especially when the lining of the blood vessel is too permeable, because \r\nof the influence of polyunsaturated fats, prostaglandins, estrogen, \r\netc., the heme and iron will enter the endothelial cells, where the \r\niron will catalyze the formation of free radicals, and the heme will \r\nbe broken down by the enzyme heme oxygenase, into biliverdin, iron, \r\nand carbon monoxide, which can contribute to the oxidative stress of \r\nthe cells. Carbon monoxide makes the blood vessel lining more permeable, \r\nallowing fats and fibrinogen to enter the cells (Allen, et al., 1988).Although cholesterol is protective against oxidative and cytolytic damage, \r\nthe chronic free radical exposure will oxidize it. During the low cholesterol \r\nturnover of hypothyroidism, the oxidized variants of cholesterol will \r\naccumulate, so cholesterol loses its protective functions.When the metabolic pathways of the steroid hormones were being worked \r\nout, an experimenter perfused an isolated ovary with blood. When the \r\namount of cholesterol in the blood pumped into the ovary was increased, \r\nthe amount of progesterone in the blood leaving the ovary increased \r\nproportionately. In the healthy organism, cholesterol is constantly \r\nbeing synthesized, and constantly converted into steroid hormones, and, \r\nin the liver, into the bile salts that are secreted to emulsify fats \r\nin the intestine. Thyroid hormone and vitamin A are used in the process \r\nof converting cholesterol into pregnenolone, the immediate precursor \r\nof progesterone and DHEA. Anything that interfered with these processes \r\nwould be disastrous for the organism. The supply of cholesterol, thyroid \r\nand vitamin A must always be adequate for the production of steroid \r\nhormones and bile salts. When stress suppresses thyroid activity, increased \r\ncholesterol probably compensates to some extent by permitting more progesterone \r\nto be synthesized.In very young people, the metabolic rate is very high, and the rapid \r\nconversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone \r\nusually keeps the level of cholesterol in the blood low. In the 1930s, \r\na rise in the concentration of cholesterol was considered to be one \r\nof the most reliable ways to diagnose hypothyroidism (1936 Yearbook \r\nof Neurology, Psychiatry, and Endocrinology,E.L. Sevringhaus, editor, \r\nChicago, p. 533). With aging, the metabolic rate declines, and the increase \r\nof cholesterol with aging is probably a spontaneous regulatory process, \r\nsupporting the synthesis of the protective steroids, especially the \r\nneurosteroids in the brain and retina.Many people refer to the structural importance of cholesterol for \"membranes,\" \r\nand often imply that the membranes are just at the surface of the cell \r\n(the plasma membrane). But in fact cholesterol is found in the nucleus \r\nin the chromosomes, bound to DNA and in the nuclear matrix that governs \r\nthe activation of genes, and in the mitotic spindle, which regulates \r\nseparation of the chromosomes during cell division:without sufficient \r\ncholesterol, cells divide irregularly, producing aneuploid daughter \r\ncells (i.e., they have an abnormal number of chromosomes). Aneuploidy \r\nis now coming to be recognized as an essential feature of cancer cells. \r\nA significant amount of cholesterol was recently discovered to bind \r\nto hemoglobin, suggesting that it will be found in association with \r\nmany other types of protein, when it occurs to anyone to look for it. \r\nOsmotic regulation, which is closely involved in cell division and other \r\nfunctions, appears to require cholesterol synthesis.Around 1985, a big study in Hungary showed that lowering cholesterol \r\nwith drugs caused a huge increase in the cancer death rate. Hundreds \r\nof publications appeared in the U.S. saying that wasn't possible, because \r\nlow cholesterol is good, the lower the better. The extreme increase \r\nin cancer mortality in the Hungarian study was probably the result of \r\nthe drug that was commonly used at that time to lower cholesterol, but \r\nthe pattern of mortality in that study was approximately the same pattern \r\nseen in any group with very low cholesterol. In the last 20 years, there \r\nhave been many studies showing that lowering cholesterol increases mortality, \r\nespecially from cancer and suicide, and that people with naturally low \r\ncholesterol are more likely to die from cancer, suicide, trauma, and \r\ninfections than people with normal or higher than average cholesterol.The increased mortality from accidents and suicide when cholesterol \r\nis lowered is reminiscent of the problems seen in progesterone deficiency, \r\nand it's very likely that a deficiency of the neurosteroids accounts \r\nfor it. A deficiency of progesterone and other neurosteroids (the steroids \r\nsynthesized by the nerves themselves) causes depression of mood and \r\nimpaired learning ability, among other neurological changes. As was \r\nthe case with cancer, the pharmaceutical industry continues to deny \r\nthat their anticholesterol drugs cause suicide, depression, and dementia, \r\nbut there is a large amount of evidence from human as well as animal \r\nstudies showing that mood and intelligence are depressed by lowering \r\ncholesterol. Simply injecting cholesterol into animals can improve their \r\nlearning ability. In the Framingham heart study of 1894 people extending \r\nover a period of about 20 years, people with cholesterol naturally in \r\nthe \"desirable\" range, below 200 mg.%, scored lower on \"verbal \r\nfluency, attention/concentration, abstract reasoning, and a composite \r\nscore measuring multiple cognitive domains\" than those with higher \r\ncholesterol (Elias, et al., 2005).After the age of fifty, low cholesterol is clearly associated with an \r\nincreased risk of dying from a variety of causes. A study of old women \r\nindicated that a cholesterol level of 270 mg. per 100 ml. was associated \r\nwith the best longevity (Forette, et al., 1989). \"Mortality was \r\nlowest at serum cholesterol 7.0 mmol/l [=270.6 mg%], 5.2 times higher \r\nthan the minimum at serum cholesterol 4.0 mmol/l, and only 1.8 times \r\nhigher when cholesterol concentration was 8.8 mmol/l. This relation \r\nheld true irrespective of age, even when blood pressure, body weight, \r\nhistory of myocardial infarction, creatinine clearance, and plasma proteins \r\nwere taken into account.\"The next step in studies of this sort should be to see how the combination \r\nof extra thyroid with adequate cholesterol influences longevity. The \r\nrising cholesterol that commonly occurs with aging is probably only \r\npartial compensation for declining thyroid function, and by optimizing \r\nall of the protective factors, radical changes in the aging process \r\nmay be possible.In the roundworm C. elegans, which is now a very popular animal for testing \r\naging theories, because its genes and cells have been thoroughly \"mapped,\" \r\nit was recently found that adding a gene that simply allows it to synthesize \r\ncholesterol, rather than depending on food for its sterols, increased \r\nits life span by as much as 131% (Lee, et al., 2005). That would be \r\nlike increasing the human lifespan to about 175 years. These worms are \r\nalso more resistant than normal to radiation and heat stress.The cells of the thymus are extremely sensitive to radiation and other \r\nstressors, and their enrichment with cholesterol inhibits lipid peroxidation, \r\nDNA degradation, and death in response to radiation (Posokhov, et al., \r\n1992).Many high altitude regions of the world have high levels of background \r\nradiation, from minerals as well as cosmic rays, so it has been dogmatically \r\nbelieved that mortality from cancer and heart disease would increase \r\nwith altitude, but the reverse is true. Because oxygen at lower pressure \r\ndisplaces less carbon dioxide from the blood, the body is able to retain \r\nmore carbon dioxide at high altitude. Carbon dioxide protects against \r\nfree radicals, and also helps to deliver oxygen to tissues, to maintain \r\nefficient energy production, and to prevent cellular stress. One study \r\nfound 18 times higher incidence of hypertension in low altitude populations \r\nthan in high altitude people (Fiori, et al., 2000). For many years, \r\nthese principles have been applied in treating atherosclerosis and other \r\ndegenerative diseases, in high altitude health resorts. Even a short \r\nperiod of hypoxic treatment can improve the body's ability to eliminate \r\natherogenic lipid peroxides, possibly by improving the stress-resistant \r\nfunctions of the liver (Meerson, et al., 1988; Aleshin, et al., 1993; \r\nKitaev, et al., 1999).I think editors of medical journals generally see themselves as the \r\npurveyors of enlightenment, i.e., as the pushers of the stylish and \r\nprestigious doctrines. (Selectivity of evidence to serve the received \r\ndoctrine is the commonest form of scientific dishonesty.) But because \r\ntheir mental framework is culturally narrow, they sometimes publish \r\nthings which later could turn out to be embarrassing (if inconsistency \r\ncould embarrass such types).The recent discovery that the size of the LDL particle is a predominant \r\nfactor in the development of atherosclerosis is one of those things \r\nthat the editors and medical professors should find embarrassing.Smaller lipoprotein particles have a greater surface area exposed to \r\nthe oxidative factors in the serum, and so are more rapidly degraded \r\ninto toxic substances. People with larger LDL particles are remarkably \r\nresistant to heart disease, and the drug companies are looking for a \r\nway to turn their lipoproteins into products. But the conditions that \r\ngovern the size of the LDL particles are physically and chemically reasonable, \r\nand are causing confusion among the doctinaire.There have been several studies in India showing that consumption of \r\nbutter and ghee is associated with a low incidence of heart disease; \r\nfor example, according to one study, people in the north eat 19 times \r\nmore fat (mostly butter and ghee) than in the south, yet the incidence \r\nof heart disease is seven times higher in the south. A study in Sweden \r\nfound that the fatty acids in milk products are associated with larger \r\nLDL particles (Sjogren, et al., 2004).In a 35 day study, when butter (20% of the calories) was compared to \r\nvarious kinds of margarine (with more trans fatty acids) in a similar \r\nquantity, the LDL particles were bigger on the butter diet (Mauger, \r\net al., 2003). But in a study of the habitual diet of 414 people, large \r\nLDL particles were found to be correlated with increased \r\nintake of protein, animal fat, and trans fatty acids (Kim and Campos, \r\n2003).In a study of the effect of dietary cholesterol on the atherogenicity \r\nof the blood lipids, 52 people were given either an egg diet (with 640 \r\nmg. of extra cholesterol per day) or a placebo diet for 30 days. Those \r\nwhose LDL increased the most on the high cholesterol diet had the largest \r\nLDL particle size (Herron, et al., 2004). They concluded that \"these \r\ndata indicate that the consumption of a high-cholesterol diet does not \r\nnegatively influence the atherogenicity of the LDL particle.\" A \r\nsimilar study in Mexico found that \"Intake of 2 eggs/d results \r\nin the maintenance of LDL:HDL and in the generation of a less atherogenic \r\nLDL in this population of Mexican children\" (Ballesteros, et al., \r\n2004).The estrogen industry tried to get into the heart disease business several \r\ntimes over the last half century, and they are still trying, but the \r\nissue of estrogen's harmful effects on LDL particle size is getting \r\nsome attention. Estrogen clearly decreases the size of the LDL particles \r\n(Campos, et al., 1997). The LDL particles also get smaller at menopause, \r\nand in polycystic ovary syndrome, and in preeclamptic pregnancies, all \r\nof which involve a low ratio of progesterone to estrogen. But there \r\nare still journals publishing claims that estrogen will protect against \r\nheart disease, by reducing the atherogenic response in increasingly \r\nmysterious ways. Occasionally, people have argued not \r\nonly that estrogen is the factor that protects women against heart attacks, \r\nbut that androgens predispose men to heart disease. One of their arguments \r\nhas been that androgens lower HDL, the \"good\" form of cholesterol. \r\nHowever, there are many studies that show that testosterone and DHEA \r\n(Arad, et al., 1989) are protective against atherosclerosis. The LDL \r\nparticle size is increased by androgens, and postprandial triglyceridemia \r\nis decreased (Hislop, et al., 2001).The studies in the 1930s that showed the protective effects of thyroid \r\nhormone against atherosclerosis and heart disease have sometimes been \r\ninterpreted to mean that the thyroid is protectivebecauseit lowers the cholesterol, but since cholesterol is protective, rather \r\nthan harmful, something else explains the protective effect. Ever since \r\nthe time of Virchow, who called atherosclerosisarteritis deformans,the inflammatory nature of the problem has been clear to those who aren't \r\ncrazed by the anticholesterol cult. We are all subject to a variable \r\ndegree of inflammatory stimulation from the endotoxin absorbed from \r\nthe intestine, but a healthy liver normally prevents it from reaching \r\nthe general circulation, and produces a variety of protective factors. \r\nThe HDL lipoprotein is one of these, which protects against inflammation \r\nby binding bacterial endotoxins that have reached the bloodstream. (Things \r\nthat increase absorption of endotoxin--exercise, estrogen, ethanol--cause \r\nHDL to rise.) Chylomicrons and VLDL also absorb, bind, and help to eliminate \r\nendotoxins. All sorts of stress and malnutrition increase the tendency \r\nof endotoxin to leak into the bloodstream. Thyroid hormone, by increasing \r\nthe turnover of cholesterol and its conversion into the protective steroids, \r\nis a major factor in keeping the inflammatory processes under control.In hypothyroidism, the pituitary secretes more TSH to activate the thyroid \r\ngland, but TSH itself has a variety of pro-inflammatory actions. The \r\nC-reactive protein (CRP), which is recognized as a factor contributing \r\nto atherosclerosis, is increased in association with TSH. CRP activates \r\nmast cells, which are found in the atheroma plaques, to produce a variety \r\nof pro-inflammatory substances, including histamine.The belief that cells are controlled by a plasma membrane, and that \r\ncholesterol's main function is to participate in that membrane, has \r\nled to a culture that treats cholesterol physiology with little curiosity. \r\nA different perspective on the cell starts with a recognition of the \r\nlipophilic nature of the structural proteins (not \"membrane proteins,\" \r\nbut things like cytoskeleton-cytoplasmic ground substance, spindle, \r\ncentrosome-centrioles, nuclear matrix, etc.), with which lipids interact. \r\nModifying an extremely complex system, the living substance, cholesterol \r\nparticipates in complexity, and must be investigated with subtlety. \r\nI suspect that the physiological meaning of cholesterol has to do with \r\nmovement, stability, differentiation, memory, and sensitivity of the \r\nparts of the cells, that is, with everything physiological.The functions of cholesterol parallel the functions of other sterols \r\nin plants and other types of organism. Its functions have been refined \r\nand extended with the development of other steroids, such as progesterone, \r\nas biological requirements have evolved, but cholesterol is still at \r\nthe center of this system. To deliberately interfere with its synthesis, \r\nas contemporary medicine does, reveals a terrible arrogance.Many participants in the cholesterol-lowering cult believe that they \r\nhave succeeded in hijacking our science culture, but when the patents \r\non another generation of their drugs have expired, the cult could begin \r\nto fade away.REFERENCESBiochim Biophys Acta. 1996 Sep 13;1297(1):77-82.Effect of cholesterol \r\non rhodopsin stability in disk membranes.Albert AD, Boesze-Battaglia \r\nK, Paw Z, Watts A, Epand RM.J Hepatol. 2003 May;38(5):623-8.A possible role of cholesterol-sphingomyelin/phosphatidylcholine \r\nin nuclear matrix during rat liver regeneration.Albi E, Cataldi \r\nS, Rossi G, Magni MV.\"In nuclear matrix, cholesterol and sphingomyelin \r\nare respectively five and three times higher than those present in chromatin; \r\nthe amount of phosphatidylcholine, which it is enriched in saturated \r\nfatty acids, is lower, thus indicating a less fluid structure.\" \r\n\"The nuclear matrix lipids are independent from chromatin lipids; \r\nthe ratio cholesterol-sphingomyelin/phosphatidylcholine is higher and, \r\nas a consequence, nuclear matrix is less fluid in relation to DNA synthesis, \r\nsuggesting a specific role of nuclear matrix as a structure involved \r\nin DNA duplication.\"Gynecol Endocrinol. 1997 Aug;11(4):281-8.Impact of combined hormone \r\nreplacement therapy on serum lipid metabolism: new aspects.Alexandersen \r\nP, Haarbo J, Christiansen C.J Vasc Surg. 1988 Jan;7(1):139-52.

        "chunk_html": "Estrogen, memory and heredity:  Imprinting and the stress response================================IN OUTLINE:Stresses, including estrogen excess, activate the Heat Shock Proteins \r\n(HSP), the stress-proteins, a primitive defense system.Heat Shock Proteins and \"hormone receptors\" are closely related \r\nand interdependent.Stress (at least partly via HSP) activates viral expression, ordinary \r\ngene expression, and destabilizes the genome, activating the \"endonucleases,\" \r\nenzymes which break up DNA chains.Stress increases genetic variability.DNA chains can be chemically modified (e.g., methylated) in a way that \r\nlimits enzymes' accesss, probably as protection, and to regulate gene \r\nexpression.Genes, and subsequent growth and development, are modified by the prenatal \r\nhormonal environment, that of the newborn, and even that of the parents \r\nbefore conception.Genomic imprintingmakes maternal genes behave differently from \r\npaternal genes.Hormonal imprintingearly in life sets the pattern of expression \r\nof genes.\"Crossing-over\" intermixes the genes on the chromosomes as \r\ncells multiply.Stresses and regulatory substances can change the patterns of gene expression \r\nthat define cell types.\"Stem cells\" are those capable of renewing tissues, and may \r\nbe \"pluripotent,\" able to become glial cells and neurons in \r\nthe brain, or, in the bone marrow, to become red blood cells or white \r\nblood cells, depending on regulatory influences.\"Cloning\" animals from body cells strongly suggests that any \r\ncell is potentially totipotent, able to differentiate into any other \r\ntype of cell.We are \"imprinted\" by our mothers' hormonal and nutritional \r\nconditions, but we can intervene to correct these \"inherited\" \r\nconditions, by maintaining optimal hormonal and nutritional balances.================================Recent work in several areas of biology is showing that heredity is \r\nnot rigidly deterministic, in the way implied by traditional genetics, \r\nand it is opening the way for the development of therapies for incurable, \r\nchronic, or congenital problems,in natural and holistic ways that \r\ndon't involve the mechanistic interventions of \"gene therapy\" \r\nor \"genetic engineering.\"For example, nontoxic treatments \r\nfor cancer that were demonstrated decades ago, were discarded because \r\nthey didn't seem consistent with \"genetics.\"  Many problems \r\nthat are classified as congenital or genetic, turn out to be physiological, \r\nand correctable.  Even the brain and the heart, which until recently \r\nwere considered to be incapable of regenerative repair, are now seen \r\nto be capable of great anatomical flexibility. There are still great authoritarian forces opposed to recognizing, and \r\nsupporting, the organism's full potential.The most useful therapies \r\nwill remain in obscurity until many people see that those therapies \r\nhave a firmer scientific foundation than orthodox (antiquated) medical \r\ngenetics has.Over 100 years ago, Samuel Butler had an argument with Charles Darwin, \r\nand concluded that Darwin was philosophically muddled, and dishonest.  \r\nButler was annoyed that Darwin had belittled the work of his predecessors, \r\nincluding his grandfather, Erasmus Darwin.  Butler was defending the \r\nidea of biological intelligence, the incorporation of experience into \r\nphysiology and heredity. My parents had an old copy of  one of Darwin's books, and I was impressed \r\nby the fact that in his introduction, Darwin was careful to point out \r\nthathis ideas were already being misrepresented, and that he did \r\nnot hold \"natural selection\" to be the only mechanism of evolution,but that several factors were important, including sexual selection \r\nand the inheritance of acquired traits.  I suppose those remarks might \r\nhave been motivated partly by knowing that Butler didn't approve of \r\nthe way he was behaving, but they didn't seem to have much influence \r\non the way history has characterized Darwin's work.  All of my biology \r\nprofessors would have been happier if Darwin had never made those remarks.  \r\nI suspect that Darwin's problem was thatany theory of evolutionwas under such heavy attack that he couldn't devote much time to the \r\nrelatively minor issue of how evolution works.After Darwin's death, the study of heredity made some strange concessions \r\nto the culture of anti-evolutionism.  As people began thinking about \r\n\"particles that carry heredity,\" the \"genes,\" ideas \r\nfrom the anti-evolutionist culture formed much of the context for understanding \r\nthese \"particles.\" Darwin had suggested that the mature organism reconstitutes itself in \r\nthe germ cells, by sending gemmules or pangens (buds or sprouts or derivatives) \r\nfrom its various parts, so that the parent's traits would be incorporated \r\ninto the reproductive cells.  This was called pangenesis, meaning that \r\nthe whole organism was the source for the new offspring.  This theory \r\nopened the possibility for newly acquired traits to be passed on.  It \r\ngrew out of the experience of animal breeders and horticulturists, who \r\nwere dedicated to improving their breeds and strains,by selecting \r\nthe best individuals grown under the best conditions.It was known \r\nthat the miniature ponies,Shetlands for example, would grow larger \r\neach generation when bred under favorable conditions of domestication, \r\nrather than under the harsh conditions of their native island.It \r\napparently never occurred to most plant and animal breeders that they \r\nmight be able toimprovea breed by subjecting it to harmful \r\nconditions.Around the end of the 19th century, August Weismann began a systematic \r\nattack on the ideas of Darwin.  As part of his campaign, he invented \r\nthe doctrine that the reproductive cells are absolutely isolated from \r\nthe rest of the organism, and that they are immortal.  The rest of the \r\norganism is built up by thedeletionof genetic information.  \r\nThis doctrine was very convenient for those who maintained that all \r\norganisms had been created in a single moment, and that theappearanceof evolution resulted from the extinction of some species, but not the \r\nnew appearance of some species.  Some people, reasoning from Weismannism, \r\nsuggested that evolution might have resulted without any change in the \r\nimmortal genetic material, except deletion, in a manner analogous to \r\nWeismann's theory of the developing individual.  Bacteria, in that view, \r\nwould contain all the genes needed to make a tree or a person, and the \r\nmore complex forms would have evolved through the differential loss \r\nof that primeval genetic information. The changes produced bysubtractionwere compatible with the \r\nnotion of fallen man in a corrupt world, while theadditionof \r\nheritable traits through experience would connote a sharing in the process \r\nof creation.  The hereditary particles making up Weismann's \"immortal \r\nisolated germ line\" connoted a single original creation. As mutations in the genes came to be seen as a reality, experiments \r\nwith X-rays suggested to some that all mutations were harmful, and this \r\nattitude blended into the stream of doctrine which insisted that noimprovementcould be inherited.  Although many experiments showed \r\nwhat seemed to be meaningfullydirectedmutations, the doctrine \r\nheld its ground, as its advocates taught that mutations were always \r\nrandom.  (The doctrine of random change, like the idea that entropy only \r\nincreases, excluded acts of creation from the fallen material world.)   \r\nIf a new trait appeared under new conditions, it was said to beonly \r\nbecause an old trait was being revealed by the induced lossof another \r\ntrait. I think anyone who reads the \"landmark publications\" in genetics \r\nwill see that genetics had very little to do with scientific method, \r\nas commonly conceived, and that it had all the traits of a cult.  Analysis \r\nof the language of genetics reveals that terms have more often been \r\nused to cover up empty speculation than to clarify situations of fact. Parallel to the way Darwin infuriated Samuel Butler by misrepresenting \r\nthe origins of his theory, the neodarwinists who debate the creationists \r\nover school textbooks are ignoring the ways in which the culture of \r\nantievolutionism shaped their own view of genetics.The discovery of enzymes that produce DNA modeled on RNA, \"reverse \r\ntranscriptases,\" began undermining traditional genetics, because \r\nit showed that new information can enter our genome.The discovery that bacteria can pass \"genes\" from one individual \r\nto another, conferring antibiotic resistance upon previously sensitive \r\nstrains, was a major nuisance to people working in infectious disease, \r\nsince it complicates the treating of disease, but it indicated that \r\n\"evolution,\" or genetic change, was capable of happening in \r\nnon-random ways.Early in the study of viral genetics, many people realized that \"organisms\" \r\nwhich can't reproduce without their relatively complex hosts, presented \r\na problem for evolutionary theory.  If the virus requires a cell in order \r\nto exist, it is hardly a separate organism.  A few people suggested that \r\nviruses were, or were based on, functional normal parts of higher organisms.  \r\nSome researchers have suggested that virus-like particles serve to carry \r\ninformation from one part of an organism to other parts of that organism.  \r\nMobile genetic elements are now well recognized, operating within cells, \r\nand it is common laboratory practice to use viral particles to transfer \r\ngenetic material from one cell to another. Cellular systems which cut and splice nucleic acids, creating sequences \r\nof information which don't exist in the inherited chromosomes, are now \r\naccepted parts of cell biology.  Hormonal and environmental influences \r\non the stability of messenger RNA, and on mobile genetic elements, and \r\non genomic stability in general, are recognized.The center of \r\ngravity in the study of the nucleic acids has now shifted from heredity \r\nto development.Almost nothing remains of Weismannism, which was the foundation \r\nof neodarwinism.  The \"isolation of the germline\" doctrine \r\npersists in a few places, such as explaining why \"the ovary runs \r\nout of eggs,\" despite some examples of egg-cell renewal. But when the identity of \"germline cells\" is found to depend \r\non signals from the environment, the last vestige of Weismannian germ-line \r\ndoctrine disappears.The only meaning of \"germline\" is \r\nthat some cells are destined to be germ cells, and the meaning disappears \r\nwhen such cells differentiate to form body parts. (see Donovan, 1998, \r\nLabosky, et al., 1994.) The difference between primordial germ cells and embryonic cells is \r\na matter of \"imprinting,\" the process in which a hormone or \r\n\r\n\"growth factor\" or other \"signal\" directs a cell \r\ndown a certain course of differentiation.  \"Imprinting\" is \r\nwhere genetics and physiology, phylogeny and ontoneny, come together, \r\nand the new facts that are being discovered are removing the last vestige \r\nof scientific content from Weismannism/neodarwinism.The argument between Peter Duesberg and the virus establishment, in \r\nwhich Duesberg argues that acquired immunodeficiency is produced by \r\na variety of causes, including drug use, and the establishment argues \r\nthat the HIV retrovirus is the only cause, becomes a little clearer \r\nwhen we consider it in the context of the larger debate between the \r\ngenetic determinists and the Darwinian adaptationists.  I will talk about \r\nthat in more detail in a newsletter on immunodeficiency. The issues of cancer, aging, and \"hormone receptors,\" are \r\nalso illuminated by seeing the organism as capable of adaptive modification \r\nof its genes. These newer molecular approaches to the study of biology are vindicating \r\nsome of the practical observations of plant and animal breeders, and \r\nterms such astelegony, heterosis,andxeniamight come \r\ninto common use again, along withgenomic imprinting.Here, I want to give examples of \"hormonal imprinting\" \r\namd \"genetic imprinting,\" and to show how the idea of the \r\n\r\n\"retrovirus\" or \"mobile genetic elements\" relates \r\nto practical health issues and therapies.  The developing egg cell is \r\nconstructed and modified in many ways during its growth.  The nurse cells \r\nwhich surround it in the ovarian follicle inject massive quantities \r\nof material, especially RNA, into the expanding egg cell.  Regulatory \r\nsubstances and energy production modify enzyme activities and structural \r\nproteins, which will influence the way it develops after fertilization.  \r\nDuring the entire lifetime of the individual person, the developing \r\negg cells are open to influences from the organism as a whole.  Because \r\nof the Weismannian scientific culture, it's important to start with \r\na few of the clearest interaction between the environment and the reproductive \r\ncell, but many other types of interaction are starting to be explored.It has been suggested that environmental stress is responsible for viral \r\nepidemics, by activating viruses in their animal hosts, and causing \r\nthem to spread to humans.  Whether that's true or not, it is well recognized \r\nthat stress causes increased susceptibility to the development of viral \r\ninfections.  It also causes increased genetic variability, which is logical \r\nin the evolutionary sense, that a species should become more variable \r\nwhen its environmental niche has changed.  The mobile genetic elements \r\nthat were first recognized by Barbara McClintock are now considered \r\nto be the most important means by which stress increases genetic variability.In bacteria (J. Cairns;Salyers & Shoemaker, 1996), genetic \r\nchanges are known to occur in response to specific substances, which \r\nlead to adaptation to that substance. The mobile elements which are \r\nresponsible for the defensive adaptive response to antibiotics are similar \r\nto viruses.In these instances, the genetic dogma which has been \r\ntaught very recently in the universities couldn't have been more clearly \r\ndisproved.  So far, the tendency in the United States is to concentrate \r\non the details because of their technological potential (for genetic \r\nengineering of lucrative products) and to ignore the larger biological \r\nmeaning of this interaction of stress with genetics. Resistance to antibiotics is transmitted to other bacteria by \"injecting,\" \r\nduring conjugation of a resistant bacterium with a sensitive one, a \r\nsmall virus-like granule containing the DNA required for detoxifying \r\nthe antibiotic, along with some adjoining genes.  The antibiotic itself, \r\nproducing stress, stimulates the formation of this genetic package.  \r\n(Whole university courses used to be devoted to showing why such things \r\ncouldn't happen.) The enzymes which cut out sections of DNA are the \"restrictases,\" \r\nwhich are famous for their use in identifying samples of DNA.  These \r\n\"endonucleases\" are activated by stress.  In \"excitotoxicity,\" \r\n\r\nwhich kills nerve cells through a combination of intense activation \r\nwith deficient energy stores (i.e., stress), these enzymes are activated.In apoptosis, or \"programmed cell death,\" these enzymes are \r\nactivated, along with enzymes which repair the broken genes, and the \r\nresulting energy drain from an impossible repair job causes the cell's \r\nsudden dissolution.  Between excitotoxicity and apoptosis, there are \r\nintermediate states, in which the dissolution is retarded or reversed. When the stress is more generalized, so that the cells survive, the \r\nmore sensitive sections of DNA are rearranged within the cell.  Some \r\nof them may escape as infective particles. Barbara McClintock wrote about the effects of stress causing genetic \r\nrearrangement, and traced the movements of the mobile genetic elements.  \r\nAt the same time, without knowing about her work, Leonell Strong was \r\nworking with mice, exploring the role of \"genetic instability\" \r\n\r\nin causing cancer, and identifying estrogen and \"milk particle,\" \r\nor \"milk factor,\" a virus-like particle that interacted with \r\nestrogen, as causes of breast cancer.With only the elements ofstress,theendonucleases,and \r\nthemobile packets of genes,adaptively increased variability, \r\nand the spreading of genes among a population can be explained.  However, \r\nthere is a subtler level at which the adaptations acquired by an indiviual \r\ncan be passed on to offspring.  This is \"imprinting.\" \"Genetic imprinting\" is being studied mainly in terms of the \r\ncovering of regions of DNA with methyl groups.  This is thought to have \r\nevolved as a way to keep the endonucleases from attacking the DNA.  Sections \r\nof DNA that have been methylated can be passed on to offspring in that \r\nform, and they can be traced as a pattern of gene activity or inactivity.  \r\nThe maternal genes function in a manner identifiably different from \r\nthe paternal genes.  Having passed through the mother's body, the genes \r\nhave been modified. \"Hormonal imprinting\" refers to the great changes in sensitivity \r\nto hormones (and related substances) that persist after exposure to \r\nthat substance early in life.  When the mother's hormones are imbalanced \r\nduring pregnancy or nursing, the baby is \"imprinted\" with \r\nan altered sensitivity to hormones.  Leonell Strong showed that these \r\neffects could be exaggerated generation after generation.  But--strangely, \r\nconsidering that he was a student of T. H. Morgan, who is considered \r\nto be the founder of classical genetics--Strongfound that \r\na single treatment, or a series of treatments, with an extract of liver, \r\nor with certain nucleosides (the units for constructing DNA), could \r\nreverse the course of generations of breeding, and eliminate the susceptibility \r\nto cancer. In modern terms, he was probably working with a combination of genetic \r\nimprinting and hormonal imprinting.  His \"milk factor\" very \r\nprobably was one of the \"endogenous retroviruses,\" or mobile \r\ngenetic elements.  (However, Gaal, et al., 1998, found that imprinting \r\nfactors can be transmitted in the milk.) Movable genetic elements appear to regulate normal developmental processes \r\n(Long, et al., 1998) and the introduction of new particles can \"improve \r\nfitness.\"  This is an aspect of the HIV controversy that has been \r\ncompletely ignored, as far as I can tell.  Peter Duesberg argues that \r\nthe presence of antibodies to the HIV indicates that the immune system \r\nis active, and that there is no evidence showing the virus to be harmful.  \r\nMy suggestion would be that the virus is probably present quietly in \r\nmany people who have no antibodies to it, and that environmental toxins \r\nand other stressors cause it to be adaptively expressed, creating the \r\npossibility for an antibody response.  The \"viral particle\" \r\n\r\nitself might be biologically useful, though this wouldn't exclude the \r\npossibility that an abnormal immunological response to it could have \r\nharmful repercussions. The importance of the retroviruses in the human genome hasn't been widely \r\nappreciated. (\"almost 10%. . .homology with the retroviruses,\" \r\nDeb, et al, 1998.) Environmental pollution with estrogens and immunosuppressive substances, \r\nwhen it persists throughout the developmental period, and across generations, \r\nwill be dangerous at levels much below those that show an immediate \r\nhormonal or immunosuppressive effect.  Tests that determine the \"mutagenicity\" \r\nor \"carcinogenicity\" of a substance are performed within a \r\ncontext of a theoretical genetics which is demonstrably false;until the complexities of imprinting and transgenerational effects are \r\ntaken into account, it would be wrong to accept the claim that there \r\nare \"safe levels,\" or \"thresholds of harmful effects.\" When babies are imprinted by the mother's diuretics, by milk substitutes, \r\nand by industrial effluents, the worst effects are likely to be seen \r\ndecades later, or even generations later.There is a simple image that I think makes it possible to grasp as a \r\nwhole the unity of things which have been described as existing on different \r\n\"levels,\" the genetic, the metabolic, and the ecological.  \r\nThis is the image of an interaction between water and large molecules, \r\nsuch as proteins and nucleic acids, with the system--the way the large \r\nmolecule is folded, and the way the water molecules are ordered--having \r\nmore than one arrangement, or physical state, each state differing slightly \r\nin the amount of potential energy it contains.  Then, the differences \r\nbetween respiratory energy (producing carbon dioxide and consuming electron-equivalents), \r\nand relatively anaerobic conditions, determine the probability that \r\nthe system will return to its higher energy state after it has been \r\nperturbed. A brief perturbation amounts to simple perception and response, reflecting \r\nthe basic \"irritability\" of life, to use Lamarck's term.  But \r\nwith more intense disturbances, the structures are altered at deeper \r\nlevels, and structures will be restored with different degrees of completeness, \r\nand the organism will have adapted, according to its resources, either \r\ntoward increased \"fitness\" and sensitivity, or toward decreased \r\nsensitivity. On the level of an individual, the movement away from fitness and sensitivity \r\nwould resemble the development of aging and degenerative disease;on the level of a species, it would amount to \"reverse evolution,\" \r\na mammal would become more reptilian, a primate would become more rodent-like. Protective interventions, and therapies, will consist of things which \r\nprotect the structures (preserving sensitivity, while blocking excessive \r\nstimulation), and which increase the energy resources.  A great variety \r\nof physiological indicators show that substances such as progesterone, \r\nthyroid and carbon dioxide are acting \"universally\" as protectants, \r\nin ways that make sense only with some perspective such as this, of \r\nthe systematic changes in the physical state of the living substance.REFERENCES Eksp Onkol 1986;8(2):29-32[Nature of the endogenous retrovirus-like particles of the rat liver].Korokhov NP, Pyrinova GB, Kurtsman MIa, Tomsons VP, Salganik RI. © Ray Peat Ph.D. 2009.

However, if left untreated, benign tumors can lead to \nserious disease. malignant \ntumor-Cancer. A malignant tumor is resistant to treatment, may \nspread to other parts of the body and often recurs after removal. cancer-A malignant tumor (a malignant neoplasm).\" http://pathology2.jhu.edu/pancreas/pc_overview.cfm Issues \nthat at first seem scientific too often turn out to be merely propagandistic.When a claim has no scientific value, it's necessary to directly attack \nthat claim, but the propagandist hopes to (and often does) control the \ndiscourse, by resorting to techniques such as censorship, public relations, \nand financial-political power. The pharmaceutical industry uses all \nof those anti-scientific powers just as effectively as the military-industrial \nlobby does. While \nDonald Rumsfeld answered the question, \"where are the weapons of \nmass destruction?\" by saying \"We know where they are. They're \nin the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east, west, south and north \nsomewhat,\" the estrogen industry responds to the evidence that \nestrogen causes breast cancer, strokes, heart attacks, blood clots and \nAlzheimer's disease by saying \"it's progesterone that is responsible.\" To \ndeal with the antiscientific fraudulent claims of the estrogen industry, \nit isn't necessary to search every square meter of Iraq, as it was with \nRumsfeld's claim; it's enough to show that there is no science involved \nin their claims, by analyzing their experimental methods. But it's also \nimportant to examine some of the methods they have used to further their \ngoals, despite the absence of any factual basis. For \nmore than 60 years, the estrogen industry has been using the techniques \nof public relations, including the placement of pseudoscientific articles \nin medical journals, to promote their sales. Recently, Carla Rothenberg \ndocumented a conspiracy of the estrogen industry in the 1940s to get \nmedical and governmental approval of their products by shifting attention \naway from the clear evidence of estrogen's toxicity. Her paper competently \nreviews the subsequent history of \"Hormone Replacement Therapy.\"http://leda.law.harvard.edu/leda/data/711/Rothenberg05.pdf After \n2002 when the Women's Health Initiative study announced some of the \nharmful effects of hormone treatment, resulting in a disastrous decrease \nin estrogen sales, the industry has intensified and diversified its \npublic relations efforts, and has succeeded in recovering some of their \nlost market. Historically, whenever some of the claimed benefits of \nestrogen have been disproved, the industry shifts its emphasis to new, \npreviously unmentioned \"virtues\" of the product. Hundreds \nof different benefits claimed for estrogen in prestigious medical journals \nhave been proven false, but until 2002, the industry's profits grew \nsteadily. Now, compensating for the annual loss of billions of dollars, \nthey are highly motivated. Dozens \nof toxic effects of estrogen were demonstrated and never refuted, but \na variety of techniques of distraction and misdirection gradually emerged, \nto prevent the accumulated evidence of estrogen's toxicity (and/or ineffectiveness) \nfrom interfering with the campaigns to market it for the widest possible \nvariety of conditions. Since \nthe WHI study involved the use of Prempro (PREMPROTM--conjugated \nestrogens and  medroxyprogesterone acetate), the emphasis of the \nindustry has been to divert attention from the toxic effects of estrogen, \nby blaming everything on \"progesterone.\" An intense campaign \nis underway to assign all of estrogen's harmful effects to progesterone. The \npharmaceutical industry has a long history of lying about natural progesterone \n(and many other natural substances), to promote sales of their competing \nproducts. The price ratio of retail estrogen tablets to bulk estrogen \ncan be 1000 to 1, while the ratio for progesterone products is often \nless than 10 to 1. With the increased use of progesterone (its sales \nin the US have increased more than 100-fold), the estrogen industry \nhas had to develop new kinds of attack. A small shift of the market \naway from estrogen costs the drug industry hundreds of millions of dollars. \nThe loss of estrogen sales following the 2002 WHI study, that convincingly \ndemonstrated its toxicity, was huge, with the decreased sales of Wyeth \nalone amounting to billions of dollars. Wyeth has petitioned the FDA \nto prevent compounding pharmacies from selling the natural hormones. People \nwho have made a career of research that, according to them, reveals \nthe \"benefits\" of estrogen have, in recent years, expanded \ntheir work to argue that it is progesterone, rather than estrogen, that \ncauses diabetes, heart disease, dementia, and cancer. The \nEPA currently has a document draft on the internet which, in relation \nto the evaluation of a carcinogenic herbicide, reviews the issue of \nthe balance between estrogen and progesterone in the development of \ncancer in rats, and includes the observation that progesterone is not \ncarcinogenic to rats,and that it instead is protective against cancer, \nbecause of its antiestrogenic effects. Recently, \nstores in California have placed warnings near their progesterone-containing \ncosmetics, saying that the State of California \"knows\" progesterone \nto be a carcinogen. Californians \noften talk about their state's having the world's sixth largest economy. \nThe state accounts for 14% of the GDP of the U.S. If the state regulates \na product made in Michigan, Texas, or France, the producer is very likely \nto change the product to suit California. If \nan industry wants to control its competitors or potential competitors, \nan investment in California's regulatory system can pay huge rewards. California \nhas listed progesterone as a carcinogen under the Safe Drinking Water \nand Toxic Enforcement Act, called Proposition 65. The law doesn't prevent \nthe sale of carcinogens, it simply requires a warning. Warnings are \nposted in grocery stores and restaurants, on sports equipment, in beauty \nparlors, on apartments and parking lots, but there is so little effort \nspent on realistic evaluation of risks that the effect of the law is \nto allow the major polluters to go unnoticed among the ubiquitous warnings. \nBut California has other laws that encourage its lawyers to sue for \n\"unfair business practices\" when they believe Prop 65 has \nbeen violated. That has resulted in a culture of vigilantism with bounty-hunting \nlawyers, some of whom try to enforce Prop 65 even against companies \nthat are clearly exempt. California's \nregulatory board that lists progesterone as a carcinogen cites two bodies \nthat have evaluated carcinogens, the US National Toxicology Program \n(NTP), and the UN's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), \nas authoritative sources.One of those, the US National Toxicology \nProgram (NTP) citesthe other's, theIARC's, evaluation of progesterone as the basis for its own listing \nof progesterone, so the opinion of IARC has been very influential. The \nIARC publications discussed the toxicity of several of the synthetic \nprogestins, and concluded that some of them are possible human carcinogens. \nThe (1987) entry for medroxyprogesterone acetate, for example, has three \nsections: \"A. Evidence for carcinogenicity to humans (inadequate),\" \n\"B. Evidence for carcinogenicity to animals (sufficient),\" \nand C., that it can damage chromosomes.Eight citations, besides two IARC monographs (1974 and 1979), are given \nas supporting evidence. The \nentry for progesterone, oddly, has only two sections,\"A. \nEvidence for carcinogenicity to animals (sufficient),\"and B, that it doesn't damage chromosomes.There is no mention of \nhuman carcinogenicity at all.Besides the IARC monographs, only \none study is mentioned, a test in beagles (I'll comment on the competency \nof that study below). At the end of the whole section, which included \neleven synthetics and progesterone, it concludes: \"Overall evaluation\" \n\"Progestins are possiblycarcinogenic to humans (Group 2B),\" \noddlyneglecting to distinguish progesterone from the synthetics. The \ncorruption of the term \"progestin\" or \"progestogen\" \n\nby the industry and the drug regulators has been terribly consequential. \nThe synthetic chemicals classified as progestins often haveanti-progesteroneactions, and shouldn't be called progestins at all, because they don't \nsupport gestation, contrary to what the term falsely implies. It is \nexactly their anti-progesterone/antigestational action that led to their \nuse as contraceptives. Since the 1987 review by IARC, it seems that their only other review \nof progesterone's carcinogenicity was of a single study in 1999, and \nthat study clearly gave evidence that progesterone prevented cancer. But \nCalifornia's board of \"qualified experts\" in the Office of \nEnvironmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) identifyprogesteroneas known to cause cancer, and cites the group of studies listed by IARC \nin the medroxyprogesterone acetate report as their evidence. Rather \nthan trying to clarify the confusions that exist in the IARC documents, \nthis board has compounded the confusion. In \nthe transcript of the meeting, at which they decided to list progesterone \nas a carcinogen, they received testimony from only one outside expert, \nRichard Edgren, who answered the chairman's question, why don't you \nwant progesterone listed, by saying, because it isn't a carcinogen. \nHe said that the inclusion of a large number of non-carcinogenic materials \n\"could vitiate the use of the list.\" But \nthe chairman had, early in Edgren's review of the shortcomings of animal \nstudies of carcinogenesis, heard the word \"metastasis,\" in \nconnection with beagle dogs, and--although Edgren hadn't said that any \nmetastatic cancer had been found in the progesterone test (it hadn't)--the \ncommittee's decision to list progesterone appears to have hinged on \nthat word. Edgren, \nreferring to \"varioussynthetic and semi-synthetic progestogens,\" \nsaid that administering them by injection \"leads to the development \nof mammary nodules, some of which have the characteristics of malignant \ntumors, although these tumors rarely metastasize.\" A little later, \nKilgore said \"I mean, I heard you say that it was rare that it \nmetastasized. I would say any kind of metastasizing is important.\" \nEdgren isn't quoted in the transcript as having attempted to explain \nthat the malignant and metastatic cancers appeared only in beagles treated \nwith synthetic progestins. At best, the behavior of the chairman and \nthe committee, as reflected in that transcript, was erratic and confused, \nor more accurately, irrational. The \nonly biologist on the committee who spoke during the meeting, Dr. Spangler, \nexpressed confusion and dissatisfaction with the evidence: \". \n. . in reviewing the information that was supplied to me regarding progesterone, \nI was confused and concerned by what appears to be a variety of discrepancies \nin the way the compound has been reviewed.\" \"In one place, \nIARC says there is limited evidence; in another place, it says there \nis sufficient evidence. And NTP says there is sufficient evidence. And \nthey cite as their sufficient evidence a variety of very convoluted \nexperimental procedures, in which mouse mammary tumor virus positive \nmice were used in a study; and, in addition to that, some other carcinogen, \nsome other potent carcinogen, was applied at the same time or after.\" \n\"It was just very confusing. And I had a lot difficulty evaluating \nit.\" The \nState's rules explicitly state thatall the relevant evidenceis to be presented to the committee for consideration, and that the \nevidence must show clearly,by accepted scientific methods,thata material causes cancer (i.e., malignant tumors)before it can \nbe listed. What is clearly shown by the few papers provided to the committee \nis that their procedures were not followed at all. Providing publications \nthat didn't even claim to have involved the development of cancer, and \nignoring an immense amount of more relevant evidence, the committee, \nin a parody of legal process, didn't even get a randomly selected sampling \nof the relevant evidence. In \nmy correspondence with OEHHA, when I pressed for information regarding \nthe criteria for selecting evidence, and the qualifications of the staff \nwho had the responsibility of selecting \"all relevant evidence,\" \ntheir response was that they lacked the resources to answer the question. Edgren, \nwho had argued that progesterone wasn't a carcinogen, didn't make a \nvery good presentation of the case against the few studies that had \nbeen mentioned by NTP and IARC. Even if he had been able to do that, \nin the few minutes he had (six or seven different substances were on \nthe agenda for consideration for listing during that meeting), it doesn't \nseem likely that the committee would have been interested. In \na letter he wrote to the committee before it met, Edgren said\"Careful \nevaluation of data from a properly conducted oral study is a prerequisite \nbefore the carcinogenicity of any chemical can be adequately evaluated.\"The reason for that statement is that it had become clear in the 1970s \nand 1980s that the invasive introduction of anything into the body's \ntissues creates inflammation and a complex series of systemic stress \nreactions that affect the immune system, and that can lead to the development \nor promotion of cancer, no matter how inert and innocuous seeming the \ninjected material might be. The people on the committee didn't even \ndiscuss that issue. Worse, the studies mentioned by IARC included some \nthat hadn't met basic scientific standards of experimental design, failing \nto use proper experimental controls, including vehicle controls, and \nfailing to describe the actual composition of the vehicle or solvent \nused for administering progesterone. Every \ngood high school science teacher or science student knows that the experimental \nvariables have to be clearly defined. The United Nations' IARC, the \nUS's NTP, and California's Panel of Qualified Experts chose to draw \nconclusions on some studies that don't meet any standards for testing \ncarcinogens, such as those published by the US government. And while \ndisregarding basic standards of experimental design, their review of \nthe literature had an even more serious flaw--it \"cherry-picked\" \n\nthe published evidence that they apparently preferred, ignoring the \nstudies which, over a period of more than 20 years, showed that progesterone \nprevents and/or cures tumors. And in an extremely unrepresentative selection \nof studies on the subject of progesterone's carcinogenicity, the selected \nstudies presented some clear evidence of some of progesterone's anticarcinogenic \neffects, along with some results that can't be interpreted clearly. One \nof the early papers listed as evidence of progesterone's carcinogenicity \nin animals actually concluded that their experiments completely failed \n\"to produce any beneficial effect by the administration of progesterone \non the mammary cancer in mice,\" and cautioned that their results \nshowed \"the need for care in attempting to generalize results even \nin different strains of the same species and emphasizes the difficulty \nof attempting to carry over results obtained in experimental animals \nto human pathology.\" (Burrows and Hoch- Ligeti, 1946). The \nwork (demonstrations of the anti-tumor effect of progesterone) that \nthey were not able to confirm had included explicit observations thatintermittent injectionsof progesterone were not effective in preventing \ntumors or causing them to regress, and emphasized the importance of \ncontinuous exposure. Knowing that, the Burrows and Hoch-Ligeti publication \nappears to have been designed propagandistically to oppose the work \nthat was demonstrating the anti-tumor actions of progesterone, since \nthey--without explanation--used the already discredited method of giving \nperiodic injections of progesterone dissolved in peanut oil. Without \nreading the article, people seeing it included on the agencies' list \nof studies supposedly providing evidence of progesterone's carcinogenicity \nwould assume that it provided such evidence. It didn't. If the agencies \ncite this study, why didn't they mention any of the numerous studies \nshowing that progesterone prevents tumors or causes them to regress? \nThe reason this study was done was to argue against the studies that \nhad demonstrated progesterone's protective effects, so anyone reading \nit had to know of those other studies' existence, as well as knowing \nthat this study itself provided no evidence at all of carcinogenicity. Reproducibility \nis the essence of science, and the anti-tumor effects of progesterone \nwere repeatedly demonstrated by different investigators. The single \nstudy by Burrows and Hoch-Ligetti has never been replicated, and the \nreason for its failure to show an anti-tumor effect was already explained \nby the other workers. Since \nthe 1920s, many studies had demonstrated that \"spontaneous\" \ncancers increase in proportion to the quantity of polyunsaturated fat \n(especially linoleic acid) in the diet. By the end of the 1960s, the \ncarcinogenicity of vegetable oils, or at least their \"co-carcinogenicity\" \nor \"tumor promoting\" effects had become widely known, and \none of the World Health Organization publications observed that progesterone \ncarcinogenicity studies using vegetable oil as the vehicle couldn't \nbe recognized as valid. More \nrecently, ethanol has been found to antagonize progesterone's anticancer \nand anti-proliferative actions. Studies \nusing implanted pellets or plastic tubes containing a solution of progesterone \nsometimes neglected to even mention the nature of the solvent used. \nSince implanted pieces of inert materials, such as disks of plastic, \ncould be carcinogenic, it was recognized that a proper control for a \nhormone-containing pellet or tube would require the implantation of \na pellet or tube without the hormone. Sometimes, instead of actually \nimplanting the object, sham surgery, similar to that involved in implantation \nof the pellet, would be used, in recognition that the surgical trauma \nitself could have far reaching effects on the organism. Any \ntissue damage or irritation causes the release of cytokines and mediators \nof inflammation, which are known to be involved in tissue growth and \ncancer. When injected, even plain water and other normally harmless \nthings are carcinogenic. The \nneed for proper experimental controls when using implanted devices is \nshown by a study that analyzed the fibrotic tumors that had grown around \nimplanted plastic tubes. Crystals of talc were found in the tumor, that \nwere assumed to have originated from the surgical gloves used during \nthe operation. Talc is now widely recognized as a carcinogen, and is \nsuspected of causing ovarian cancer. Overlooked \nvariables are the reason for the essentiality of repeatability and confirmation \nin science. In \nthe 1970s, a new method for suspending or dissolving oily chemicals \nin water was being explored. A cyclic carbohydrate, cyclodextrin, makes \nit possible to wet substances that are insoluble in water, such as progesterone, \neven if the substance remains in a solid crystalline form. Several companies \nwere promoting the use of these for the administration of hydrophobic \ndrugs. In \n1976, D.W. Frank reported that the cyclodextrins produced nephrosis \nin rats. In 1978, a study by Perrin, et al., reported its toxicity to \nthe kidneys. Twenty years later, Horsky and Pitha at NIH reported that \nthe cyclodextrins can synergize with carcinogens, and in 1982 a group \nin Japan reported that cyclodextrins can increase the production of \nkidney cancers by another carcinogen (Hiasa, et al.). The intrinsic \ncarcinogenicity of a more water soluble cyclodextrin, that was considered \n\n\"more toxicologically benign,\" was found to cause pathological \nchanges in lungs, liver, and kidney, and to increase the formation of \ntumors in the pancreas and intestines of rats (Gould and Scott, 2005). In \n1974, D. W. Frank and others at Upjohn had begun testing the effects \nof progesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate in beagle dogs, using \nan \"aqueous suspension.\" Their 1979 publication describing \nthat four year study didn't mention the way in which the \"aqueous \nsolution\" had been made, and didn't mention cyclodextrins at all.  \nFrank's published observation during the beagle study that cyclodextrins \nare toxic to the kidneys suggests that someone at Upjohn had noticed \na problem with the \"wetting agent\" that was already in use \nin the beagle study. Another \nremarkable feature of the four year beagle study was that, of 140 dogs \nthat began the intended 7 year study, 28 had died by the time they published \nthe report, and none died of cancer, but the causes of death were not \nreported. The only experimental group in which there were no deaths \nby the end of four years was the low dose progesterone group. The dogs \nin the high dose progesterone group received weekly intramuscular injections \nof 1140 mg of progesterone suspended in 11.4 ml of \"aqueous vehicle.\" \n2345 ml of the vehicle was received by each dog during the four years. \nOnly four dogs in that group were still alive at the time of publication, \nbut the cause of death of the other 16 wasn't mentioned. Quarts of a \ntoxic material that had never before been used in this way, injected \ninto their muscles, and the unexplained deaths of so many animals, make \nthis a unique experiment that is unlikely ever to be repeated. Their \nfailure to mention injection-site muscle damage is just another indication \nof the study's low quality. At \nthe time of the study, it had been known for many years that interference \nwith the organism's detoxifying systems, especially the liver and kidneys, \ncan contribute to the development of cancer. Although the study was \nplanned to continue for 7 years to meet the FDA requirement,none \nof the eight authors ever published again on a related topic, and \nmost of themdidn't publish again at all. When \nI tried to contact one of the authors, he didn't respond. I assume they \nwere embarrassed by the shoddiness of their methods. Richard Edgren \nhas commented, \"I can't believe how fast and how completely they \nshut down. They fired people and retrained the rest for other areas.\" But \nthe regulatory agencies have tied their reputations to studies of that \nsort. No \nmalignant cancers were reported in this four-year beagle study. Beagles \nnormally have a high incidence of cancer, especially mammary cancer. \nIn a different study in which 172 beagles were treated with contraceptive \nhormones, nine of them developed malignant cancers, and of those, five \nmetastasized. (This might be why the chairman of the committee was thinking \nabout metastatic cancer, but if so, he was simply confused, because \nthe issue they were considering was the listing of natural progesterone, \nwhich wasn't reported to have produced any malignant or metastatic tumors.) Two \nother studies cited by the IARC and other agencies, by Jones and Bern, \n1977, and Rebout and Pageaut, hardly seem appropriate studies to support \nthe idea that progesterone is carcinogenic. Jones' \nand Bern's paper described the production, 12 months after neonatal \ntreatment with progesterone, of vaginal and cervical lesions, and mammary \nnodules, which are also referred to as tumors. \"Progesterone alone \ninduced cervical lesions in only 1 of 32 mice...and induced vaginal \nlesions in only 2 or 32 mice. Furthermore, progesterone given with either \ndose of estrogen to intact mice reduced the incidence of hyperplastic \nlesions, compared with intact groups treated with estrogen alone.\" \nThey commented (page 74) that their results were \"mammary tumor \nvirus dependent,\" and that this might account for the production \nof \"hyperplastic alveolar nodules as opposed to\" tumors of \npossible ductal origin, that had been seen in other studies when the \ncarcinogen DMBA was used. In \nanother 1977 publication, Jones, Bern, and Wong described changes seen \nwhen the mice were 1.5 to 2 years old. This later publication appears \nto clarify the meaning of nodules or tumors in the younger animals:\"Although mammary tumors were observed neither in control nor in \nprogesterone-treated intact mice, many of the latter group possessed \nhyperplastic alveolar-like mammary nodules and other dysplasias.\"Neither of these studies refers to the carcinogenicity of progesterone. The \n1977 study (at the University of California, Berkeley) was explicitly \nmotivated by Jones' and Bern's concern with the risks of the medical \npractice of treating pregnant women with DES and a synthetic progestin, \nand they used mammary tumor virus-bearing mice, and they didn't continue \nthe study to observe the incidence of actual cancers. (Their choice \nof infant rodents to study progesterone might be questioned, because \nof earlier work showing thatimmature rat ovaries are able to convert \nprogesterone to estrogens,unlike the tissues of other animals or \nhumans: Quattropani and Weisz, 1973; Weniger, et al., 1984, later reported \nsimilar results.) Anyone \nworking with mammary tumor virus-bearing mice in the 1970s should have \nbeen aware of the effects of sex hormones on the expression of virus \nand development of cancer in the infected mice, as studied by Strong, \nFigge, and others for about 40 years. Excess estrogen causes the virus \nto be expressed, progesterone opposes its expression. Jones \nand Bern injected the newborn mice with 0.02 ml of sesame oil daily \nfor five days, with or without estrogen and progesterone. A newborn \nmouse weighs a little over a gram. On a weight and volume basis, this \nwould be like injecting an adult human with more than a quart of sesame \noil daily for five days. The proportionate weight of progesterone in \nan adult human would be several grams per day. This \namount of progesterone is far more than the anesthetic dose. Since the \nauthors didn't mention anesthesia, very little of the progesterone could \nhave been absorbed, meaning that deposits of crystals would have remained \nin their tissues. Tissue \nirritation from foreign bodies and from vegetable oil, even in relatively \nsmall amounts, can produce severe systemic reactions, because of the \nreactive production of nitric oxide, prostanoids, and a great variety \nof pro-inflammatory and tumor-promoting cytokines. This \nstudy might have had the formal appearance of a scientific experiment, \nbut the unfamiliarity of the men with the material they were using, \ntheir use of mice carrying the mammary tumor virus, and, more importantly, \nthe extremely complex reactions produced when extraneous materials are \ninjected into the tissues, make this a useless experiment. The value \nof Richard Edgren's statement about the need to test carcinogens orally, \nrather than by injection, is becoming clearer all the time, as the role \nof irritation in cancer development is being better understood. In \ntheir second 1977 study, Jones, Bern and Wong reported that at the age \nof 1.5 to 2 years, nearly two thirds of the progesterone treated mice \nhad genital tract lesions. In another study published in 1977 (Iguchi \nand Takasugi) neonatal mice were given the same daily amount of progesterone, \nbut for ten days rather than five,giving them twice the dose. These \nauthors reported that there were no permanent changes in the vaginal \nand uterine epithelium. This study wasn't mentioned by any of the agencies, \nbut it calls the results of the California study into question. In \na 1973 study by Rebout and Pageaut, progesterone was administered in \na pellet,the composition of which was not mentioned, and there was \nno vehicle control at all.Each mouse received 45 mg of progesterone. \nThe average mouse weighs about 30 grams. Invasive squamous carcinomas \nwere produced by the carcinogen 20-methylcholanthrene, and these were \nmore numerous in the progesterone treated mice. Methylcholanthrene is \nan extremely hydrophobic, highly irritating hydrocarbon which has often \nbeen used to create experimental cancers.  The method of administering \nthe carcinogen isn't clearly described: \"Local exposure of carcinogen \n... in the cervical canal for 9 weeks ... induced one invasive carcinoma \nin the vagina-exocervix and five in the endocervix.\" It was introduced \ninto the cervical canal, but in what form and how often isn't described. \nMethylcholanthrene has some estrogenic properties. Estrogen \nincreases the production of mucus in the cervix and vagina, and increases \nits water content and mobility. Abundant and fluid mucus has a cleaning \naction, eliminating bacteria and other material. Progesterone makes \nthe mucus more viscous and less hydrophilic, and when it dominates the \nreproductive physiology, it effectively creates a plug in the cervix \nthat prevents the entry of sperms. The \nchoice of the cervix and vagina suggests that the authors were \"engineering\" \n\nthe experimental outcome, because the effect of progesterone on cervical \nmucus is very well known. To apply the irritant to an area where it \nwould normally be washed away by the mucus, but where it is kept in \nplace by hormonally altering the mucus, is really a way of manipulating \nhow much exposure to the irritating chemical the tissue will receive. \nIt's analogous to studying the \"toxicity\" of an antihistamine, \nby applying a toxin to the nasal membrane of a person with a cold, and \nthen administering the antihistamine to stop the flow of mucus, allowing \nthe membrane to fully absorb the applied dose of toxin. A \ndifferent chemical carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene was used \nin another 1973 study (Jabara, et al.), in combination with progesterone. \nIn this experiment, the carcinogen was administered to rats in one dose \nby stomach tube, dissolved in corn oil. The progesterone was injected \nsubcutaneously in 3 mg doses in corn oil three times per week. Unfortunately, \nthere was no control group in which the corn oil was injected alone. The \nprogesterone was supposedly dissolved in the corn oil, one tenth ml \nper dose. That amount of progesterone (3% weight/volume) will dissolve \nin hot corn oil, but as the oil cools, the progesterone crystallizes \nand precipitates. That creates doubt regarding what the animals were \nactually receiving. Corn \noil is one of the most effective vegetable oil tumor promoters/carcinogens, \nand it's now considered improper to use it as a solvent for testing \neven oral carcinogens, since some chemicals that are carcinogenic in \nthe oil are relatively harmless when administered without the corn oil. \nThe animals got 2 ml of corn oil in the stomach feeding with the carcinogen. \nOne of the groups (group 5) received, in addition, more than 6 ml of \ncorn oil in the injections. The experiment lasted only 135 days, and \nin the group that received only the carcinogen, the mortality was only \n5%, and that death occurred shortly after the carcinogen was administered. \nAll of the groups receiving the corn oil and progesterone injections \nhad higher mortality, two with 25%, one with 37.5% mortality. Despite \ntheunexplained general problem with prematurely dying rats,the authors found that \"The relative incidence rates indicated \nthatpretreatment with progesterone inhibited tumorigenesis,except in the group (5) in which progesterone treatment was continued \nfor the duration of the experiment.\" Without progesterone, it is \nalmost certain that the additional corn oil injected would haveincreasedtumorigenesis in all experimental groups. Without \nthat vehicle control group, the experiment can just as well be described \nas a test of corn oil, rather than of progesterone. If you claim to \nbe testing the capacity of a substance to promote tumors, it shouldn't \nbe administered in a standard tumor promoter. A \n1968 publication by Glucksmann and Cherry was included in the documents \noffered as evidence of progesterone's carcinogenicity. Unfortunately, \nthey neglected to identify the vehicle used for giving twice weekly \nintramuscular injections of 1 mg of progesterone, and they didn't have \na vehicle control for the progesterone injections. At that time, the \nmost common vehicle was a mixture of 9% benzyl alcohol and oil, usually \nsesame or peanut oil. Benzyl alcohol by itself is quite toxic, and was \nresponsible for the death or brain damage of thousands of babies in \nhospitals, even in the small amounts that remained as residue in tubing \nafter they had been rinsed with \"bacteriostatic water,\" which \ncontains 0.9% benzyl alcohol, and which is still used as the vehicle \nfor many injections, such as penicillin and vitamin B12. The antitoxic \n(or \"catatoxic\") action of progesterone greatly reduces the \ntoxicity of benzyl alcohol. In \ndiscussing the effects of hormones on the induction of sarcomas, Glucksmann \nand Cherry comment that \"The rate of induction of sarcomas in intact \nrats was slowed down slightly by treatment with progesterone and not \nsignificantly increased in spayed animals....\" In \ntheir Discussion section, they mention several previous studies in relation \nto their own results, and comment, regarding other studies, that \"The \neffect of progesterone on the type of induced cervical cancer in mice \nconsists in increasing the columnar component of mixed carcinomas in \ncastrates. . .without materially affecting the induction period \nand tumour yield. Thus the experimental evidence in rats and miceis not as clearly antitumorigenicas that of Lipschutz (1950) for \nguinea pigs and the clinical observations (Ulfelder, 1962; Jolles, 1962).\" Comparing \nthis study to that of Burrows and Hoch-Ligetti, the dose of 2 mg per \nweek per rat is lower, on a body-weight basis, than the earlier study's \ndose of 1 mg per week in mice, but the greater frequency came a little \ncloser to the continuous treatment that Lipschutz said was necessary. \nThis could account for the fact that some of their results were intermediate \nbetween those of the Lipschutz group and those of Burrows and Hoch-Ligetti. In \nGlucksmann's and Cherry's results, progesterone retarded one type of \ntumor and appeared to promote another (an epithelial tumor, which wasn't \ndescribed as malignant or cancerous), but if the progesterone was dissolved \nin a tumor promoting solvent, it's impossible to ascribe the effect \nto progesterone. Vegetable oil applied to epithelium that has been exposed \nto a carcinogen such as the DMBA they used will typically increase the \ngrowth of the tumors. Without information about the vehicle, it's impossible \nto interpret that part of their results clearly, but anyway, they didn't \ndescribe any carcinogenic effect of progesterone; they did, however, \ndescribe a clearlyanticarcinogenicaction. A \n1962 study, by Capel-Edwards, et al., was intended to compare the effects \nof prolonged administration of high doses of progesterone with the known \ntoxic effects of synthetic progestagens. They didn't find any malignant \ntumors, so the study can't be taken as evidence of the carcinogenicity \nof progesterone. The vehicle used for dissolving the progesterone consisted \nof benzyl alcohol, ethanol, and ethyl oleate. Some of the solutions \ncontained more than 10% progesterone. When this sort of solution interacts \nwith water in the tissues, it causes the progesterone to crystallize \nout of solution. The authors reported that \"subcutaneous tissue \nreactions developed at injection sites,\" and that these \"occurred \nin all animals, including controls, and were apparent for several days \nafter the injection.\" These injection-site lesions sometimes developed \ninto \"sterile abscesses which eventually ulcerated and healed.\" \n\nThe only dog that died during the study was in the control group, and \nalthough there were \"a number of pathologic findings,\" the \nexact nature of that dog's sickness couldn't be determined. The injections \nwere given daily, fora total of 518 injections in each animal,and each injection contained as much as 4 ml of the vehicle. Almost \nan ounce per week of this material, combined with the massive irritation \nproduced by crystallization at hundreds of injection sites, would be \nthe most likely explanation for the various inflammatory changes they \nsaw, including osmotic fragility of red blood cells, and as much as \na 50% enlargement of liver and kidneys. Although \nsome of the basic ideas about canine physiology that were held when \nthe Capel-Edwards study was designed have been found to be mistaken, \nand the toxicity of their vehicle can now be seen, and they didn't conclude \nthat progesterone was carcinogenic, their study wasn't the worst of \nthose that have been presented as evidence of progesterone's carcinogenicity. When \nan experimenter doesn't yet have a clear hypothesis, it's reasonable \nto do some exploratory tests, just to get an orientation to the possibilities \nso that it's possible to form a well defined hypothesis, before designing \nan experiment that will test the hypothesis. Sometimes an experimenter \nand journal editors will allow a merely exploratory experiment to be \npublished. If they don't draw inappropriate conclusions from the ambiguous \nresults, the publication can be justified, simply because it might stimulate \nothers to investigate the subject more thoroughly. But \noften editors allow the author to draw conclusions from the experiment \nthat are not directly implied by the data, especially when those conclusions \nsupport the editor's prejudices. A conclusion may be consistent with, \nthough not implied by, the results of the experiment. These publications \nmay be effective propaganda, but they aren't good science. But \nCalifornia's OEHHA identifies those eight publications as \"the \nrelevant evidence that clearly shows through scientifically valid testing \naccording to generally accepted principles that progesterone causes \ncancer.\" In \n2004, the agency was petitioned to remove progesterone from the list. \nIn the document rejecting that petition, they mentioned that IARC in \n1999 had reviewed newer evidence confirming the carcinogenicity of progesterone. \nAfter months of asking the man in charge of rejecting the petition to \nidentify that very important new data, I hadn't received an answer, \nso I wrote to IARC, and the man in charge there responded: \"The \nIARC (1999) review is actually an IARC Monographs volume (Vol.72) . \n. . . This volume focuses on contraception and post-menopausal therapy. \nProgesterone is not used for these indications and, hence, after a quick \nsearch in the book I found only one reference that clearly reports an \nexperiment with progesterone.\" [Wednesday, October 04, 2006 \n12:44 AM] That \narticle(Grubbs CJ, Peckham JC & McDonough KD (1983) Effect of \novarian hormones on the induction of 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea-induced \nmammary cancer. Carcinogenesis 4(4):495-497)reported that progesteronereduced the incidence of mammary cancers caused by a carcinogen administered \nin vegetable oil. I \ndon't think it's possible that anyone could read articles like this,that don't even claim to show that progesterone causes cancer,and \nconclude that they provide evidence of progesterone's carcinogenicity.The choice of \"evidence\" seems to have been a selection of \ntitles of unread articles.And even the title of the 1999 IARC volume \nwould have suggested to most people that it wasn't a review of progesterone. The \nlack of vehicle controls in some of the studies, the use of an unnamed \nvehicle in one beagle study, and the use of tumor-promoting vehicles \nin most if not all of the studies, means that no scientifically competent \nor valid studies have been cited by IARC, NTP, or the California state \nbureaucracy, OEHHA, to support California's claim that they know progesterone \nis a carcinogen. In \ntheir 2004 document, OEHHA mentioned 17 articles that had been submitted \nregarding progesterone's protective effects. Some of these were identified;two were egregiously misrepresented in a single sentence: Plu-Bureau, \net al., were said to have reported \"no association between breast \ncancer risk and progesterone topically applied for the treatment of \nmastalgia and benign breast disease...\" What Plu-Bureau, et al., \nsaid immediately following that was \"Although thecombined treatment \nof oral progestogens with percutaneous progesterone significantly decreased \nthe risk of breast cancer (RR = 0.5; 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.9) \nas compared with nonusers,there was no significant difference in \nthe risk of breast cancer in percutaneous progesterone users versus \nnonusers among oral progestogen users.\" (RR means \"relative \nrisk,\" or \"risk ratio,\" and 0.5 means a 50% reduction \nin risk.) Cowan, \net al. (1981), according to the OEHHA document, reported \"reduced \npremenopausal breast cancer in women who had a history of progesterone \ndeficiency.\" What they actually said was \"These women were \ncategorized as to the cause of infertility into 2 groups, those with \nendogenous progesterone deficiency (PD) and those with nonhormonal causes \n(NH).  Women in the PD grouphad 5.4 times the risk of premenopausal \nbreast canceras compared to women in the NH group.  This excess \nrisk could not be explained by differences between the 2 groups in age \nat menarche or age at menopause, history of oral contraceptive use, \nhistory of benign breast diseases, or age at 1st birth.Women \nin the PD group also experienced a 10-fold increase in deaths from all \nmalignant neoplasmcompared to the NH group.\" Ending \nthe paragraph that mentioned those studies, the California document \ncontinues: \"However, there is also evidence that progesterone may \nhave a mitogenic effect. For example, Soderqvist et al. (1997) found \nthat in breast cells of healthy women, cell proliferation was correlated \nwith serum progesterone levels, thereby suggesting a proliferative action \nof progesterone.\" Such \na suggestion is not made by that \"correlation.\" The authors \nsaid, \"Our objective was to assess proliferation in normal breast \nepithelial cells from healthy women during the follicular and luteal \nphases of the menstrual cycle.\" At the beginning of the luteal \nphase,bothestrogen and progesterone normally rise several-fold, \nso the small increase in proliferative rate also correlates with estrogen \nlevels. A \"defective luteal phase\" is common, in which the \nratio of estrogen to progesterone is high, and in that case progesterone's \nwell established antiproliferative, differentiative effect will be overridden \nby estrogen's proliferative stimulation. The \nstate's reviewers didn't comment on the studies which showed that progesterone, \nbesides inhibiting proliferation, also inhibits an \"oncogene\" \nwhich is associated with cancer, rather than just with proliferation. \nInstead, they cited a meaningless \"correlation\" as if it were \nsome kind of argument against progesterone's anticancer effects. The \nauthors of this document don't seem to know very much about the biology \nof cancer, but maybe they know too much about the issue of the proliferation \nof breast epithelium. In \na paragraph \"rebutting\" the petitioner's point that \"This \nnew research supports that exogenous progesterone actuallyreducesthe risk of breast cancer in humans,\" the authors don't mention \nthat point at all, but instead refer to cancer treatment and to the \nvarious claims relating to progesterone's carcinogenicity, ending with \nthe mention of \"studies that suggest progesterone stimulates cell \nproliferation (e.g., Soderqvist et al., 1997).\" Apparently the \nauthors had no answer to the petitioners' point, and preferred to talk \nabout proliferation of breast cells. Nearing \nthe end of the document, the authors say \"The NCI also reports \non other studies of estrogens withprogestins,which would suggest \nthatprogesteroneincreases the risk of human breast cancer,\" \n\nand then quotes comments on studies of estrogens with (synthetic) progestins. \nThe authors cite two more studies with synthetic progestins, and then \nsay \"As discussed above, the mammary gland was a main target site \nin animal cancer bioassays providing the basis for the IARC and NTP \nidentification of progesterone as carcinogenic.\" (The preceding \ndiscussion had mentioned the 4 year beagle study--which ended the careers \nof the researchers--and a 1993 publication by Kordon, et al., which \nhad no control group for reference, and instead compared progesterone \nwith different doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate, finding that the \nfewest tumors occurred in the progesterone group.*) The \ntechniques of distortion, diversion and evasion in this document are \nso obvious that any college composition teacher would have returned \nit to the student for revision. The document says much more about its \nauthors than about its subject. I \nthink this bureaucratic behavior is understandable only if you know \nthe composition of the group that is responsible for the progesterone \nlisting, because the proliferation of breast cells has become an important \nissue for the group around USC professor Malcolm Pike. Around \n1980, Malcolm Pike, a statistician from South Africa, working in epidemiology, \nbegan arguing that the use of oral contraceptives prevented cancer. \nThis epidemiologist, unfamiliar with steroid physiology except as it \nfiltered through the oral contraceptive industry, decided that progesterone \nwas the primary cause of breast cancer, bystimulatingcell division and increasing the tissue density of the breast. This \nline of reasoning gained adherents in the USC Keck School of Medicine, \ndespite an overwhelming amount of contrary evidence, accumulated over \nmore than 50 years, that progesterone protects against breast cancer, \npartly byinhibitingcell division, and that increased \nbreast density is significantly associated with breast mitogens, such \nas serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF), prolactin, and estrogens, \nrather than with progesterone. Breast \nmitogens correspond to both breast density and the risk of breast cancer \n(Boyd), but progesterone (antimitogen) corresponds to factors associated \nwithlow riskof breast cancer.Progesterone may reduce breast density by inhibiting some growth factors, \nincluding IGF, NO (nitric oxide), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth \nfactor), bcl-2 (a protein that inhibits apoptosis), polyamines, and \nprostaglandins. Much \nof the research at USC's Keck School has been generously funded by pharmaceutical \ncompanies with huge interest in estrogen-related products. The medical \nschool website has articles by their faculty that give the impression \nthat they are often more concerned with the fate of the estrogen market \nthan with the science they claim to be doing. For example, commenting \non the WHI evidence showing that estrogen helps to cause Alzheimer's \ndisease, professor B.E. Henderson said \"I continue to believe that \nestrogen therapy may help reduce a woman's risk of developing Alzheimer's \ndisease. . . .\"I noticed that there were hundreds of other \nestrogen-related items on the USC website. The \nmedical school, some of its professors, government agencies, and private \ncompanies are involved in some very complex, overlapping activities \nthat give the impression of what used to be called \"conflicts of \ninterest.\" The \nKeck School (a private institution), and the company, Balance Pharmaceuticals, \nInc., controlled by three of their professors, participate in the business \npromotion organization operated by the State of California, Larta Institute, \nwhich manages Project T2, which is part of a \"commercialization\" \nsystem, involving awards of federal government money:\"The organization will provide the awardees with assistance in \nall aspects of commercialization, including business development, funding \nand capital acquisition,government regulatory processes,intellectual \nproperty protection, licensing strategies, and merger and acquisition \nopportunities. SBIR Phase II is the research and development stage of \nthe well-known program, with award sizes typically starting at $750,000 \neach.\" \"Working with one of the Federal government's largest \nand most important agencies to assist SBIR awardees on the cusp of commercialization \nis a natural extension of everything we've done for the past ten years,\" \n\nsaid Larta Institute CEO Rohit Shukla. Besides \nthe issue of giving public money to private groups to commercialize \nideas, many of which were developed using government-funded research, \nadding assistance with \"government regulatory processes\" to \nthe help given to private corporations should arouse suspicions. The \nidea of \"privatization\" is given a new dimension:It's \nall for the insiders, without the usual lip-service paid to \"competition.\" On \nCalifornia's committee that chooses chemicals to put on their list of \n\n\"known carcinogens\" is Juliet Singh, who is the chief executive \nofTrans Pharma Corporation, a company that is developing transdermal \ndrug delivery systems, for example for giving hormones by applying them \nto the skin. Under California's law, chemicals on the carcinogen list \nmay to sold as drugs without a warning. On \nthe committee with Singh are Anna Wu and Thomas Mack, who co-authored \nseveral papers with Malcolm Pike, who was the most visible promoter \nof the campaign against progesterone, and who with two other USC professors \ncontrols Balance Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is being promoted by Larta \nInstitute, and that's planning to market a contraceptive based on the \nidea of suppressing progesterone. Three USC professors are on California's \ncarcinogen committee,more than from any of the other universities \nin the state. In \na jury trial, I think this would look like a tainted jury. Comparing \nthe California agency's parody of legitimate process in this instance \nwith its reconsideration in 2002 of its listing of saccharin as a carcinogen \nis illuminating. In that case, there was at least a pretense that the \nstaff had made an attempt to provide \"all relevant scientific evidence\" \nfor the committee to review, as specified by the agency's regulations. \nAnd in its decision, the State's Qualified Experts made a point of declaring, \naccording to the language of the law, that in the opinion of the state's \nqualified experts it had not been \"clearly shown through scientifically \nvalid testing according to generally accepted principles to cause cancer.\" \nThe Committee found that, in this case, it had to use a \"'weight \nof evidence' approach to evaluate the body of information available....\" Unfortunately, \nthe committee allowed some bizarre speculations about calcium phosphate \nto outweigh the fact that saccharin is a mild carcinogen, and in evaluating \nthe rat experiments they were in such a hurry to remove saccharin from \nthe list that they neglected to notice that calcium phosphate precipitation \nisn't unique to rat urine, but very commonly occurs in human urine. \nTheir decision to remove it from the list rested on that non-fact. Although \nthe agency cited 150 studies, and went through the formality of describing \nsome of them in their document, anyone reading the document justifying \nthe delisting of saccharin, and the document rejecting the delisting \nof progesterone, will find it hard to see a principle of law that could \njustify removing a carcinogen from the list, because of uncertainty \nregarding the mechanism by which it causes cancer, and keeping progesterone \non the list, despite overwhelming evidence that it protects against \ncancer, and a great amount of evidence regarding the mechanisms through \nwhich the protection occurs. The \ncommittee of experts who \"weighed\" speculations about calcium \nphosphate in the 2002 saccharin document, chose not to consider, either \nin 1987 or 2004, any of the hundreds of empirical studies showing progesterone's \nprotective anticancer effects. The committee \"considered\" \napproximately half of all research publications on saccharin and cancer, \nand fewer than 1% of those relating to progesterone and cancer. Something \nother than scientific objectivity must explain those differences. The \nagency in charge of those processes of evaluating evidence of carcinogenicity \ndeclines to identify the people who made those possibly biased, certainly \nbizarre, selections of articles, or to list their qualifications for \nbeing in the crucial position of deciding what evidence would be provided \nto the Scientific Advisory Panel. And in the list of studies that the \ncommittee did receive, are two (Kwapien, et al., and Yager and Yager) \nthat are about completely different chemicals, that the agency still \nidentifies as evidence of progesterone's carcinogenicity. Many \nprogesterone products have been taken off the market because of California's \nwarning signs and labels, and as a result many women are having to rely \non their physicians for progesterone. Too many physicians know only \nwhat the pharmaceutical companies want them to know about progesterone \nand other hormones that had been available for decades in places such \nas health food stores. An \narticle in JAMA (Marcia Stefanick, April 11, 2006) was summed up by \nStefanick in a way that seems designed to encourage physicians to return \nto prescribing estrogen:\"In the estrogen and progestin \ntrial those women who got on the active pills, we saw an increase in \nbreast cancer within five years. In the case of estrogen only, we not \nonly do not see an increase by 7 years, but there's actually a suggestion \nof a decrease.\" That is a serious misrepresentation of the study. The \nrecently reported (December 15, 2006) decline of breast cancer incidence, \ncoinciding with the great decrease in the use of menopausal estrogen \ntreatments, also coincided with an increased use of natural progesterone, \nbut if the lawyers, bureaucrats, and agents of the estrogen industry \nsucceed in convincing the public that progesterone is carcinogenic, \nits use will decline, and breast cancer incidence could be expected \nto increase again. The \nstudies that show cancer prevention by progesterone have, over the years, \nfailed to resonate in the medical culture. The confusion created by \nclassifying the antiprogestational, carcinogenic synthetics as \"progestins\" \n\nis largely responsible for the failure to understand the protective \nnature of progesterone. If \nthe evidence showing that progesterone prevents or cures cancer could \nbe weighed against the evidence purporting to show that it is carcinogenic, \nI think it would be clear that something like a cultural-commercial \nmisogyny has been at work. The novelty of the newer misogyny is that \nit is so often led, or at least figureheaded by women. OTHER REFERENCES © Ray Peat Ph.D. 2007. All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com",

The \r\npromotion of natural estrogens is a new marketing strategy that \r\ncapitalizes on the immense promotional investment of the drug companies \r\nin the concept of estrogen replacement as therapy. ============================= Whether weak or strong, \r\nthe estrogenic response of a chemical, if not overcome, will add extra \r\nestrogenic burden to the system.  At elevated doses, natural estrogens \r\nand environmental estrogen-like chemicals are known to produce adverse \r\neffects. The source of extra or elevated concentration of estrogen could \r\nbe either endogenous or exogenous.The potential of exposure for \r\nhumans and animals to environmental estrogen-like chemicals is high. D. Roy, et al., 1997 ================================= Estrogen marketing has entered a new phase, based on the idea of specific \r\nestrogen-receptor modulators, the idea that a molecule can be designed \r\nwhich has estrogen's good qualities without its bad qualities.  \r\nThis specific molecule will be good for the bones, the heart, and \r\nthe brain, without causing cancer of the breast and uterus, according \r\nto the estrogen industry.  Meanwhile, soybeans are said to contain \r\nestrogens that meet that goal, and it is often said that natural \r\nestrogens are better than synthetic estrogens because they \r\nare balanced. Estrogen's \r\neffects  on cells are immediate and profound, independent of the \r\nestrogen receptors. Japanese \r\nwomen's relative freedom from breast cancer is independent of soy products:traditional soy foods aren't the same as those so widely used in the \r\nUS, for example, soy sauce doesn't contain the so-called soy estrogens, \r\nand tea is used much more commonly in Japan than in the US, and contains \r\nhealth protective ingredients.  The estrogenic and antioxidant \r\npolyphenolic compounds of tea are not the protective agents (they raise \r\nthe level of estrogen), but tea'scaffeineis a very powerful \r\nand general anti-cancer protectant.  The influential article inLancet(D. Ingram,Lancet1997;350:990-994. Phytoestrogens \r\nand their role in breast cancer,Breast NEWS: Newsletter of the \r\nNHMRC National Breast Cancer Centre, Vol. 3,No. 2, Winter 1997) \r\nused a method known to produce false results, namely, comparing the \r\nphytoestrogens (found in large amounts in soybeans) in the urine of \r\nwomen with or without breast cancer.  For over fifty years, it \r\nhas been known that the liver excretes estrogens and other toxins from \r\nthe body, and that when (because of liver inertia) estrogen isn't excreted \r\nby the liver and kidneys, it is retained in the body.  This process \r\nwas observed in both animals and humans decades ago, and it isalso \r\nwell established that estrogen itself suppresses the detoxifying systems, \r\ncausing fewer carcinogens to be excretedin the urine.  Ingram's \r\nevidence logically would suggest that the women who have cancer are \r\nfailing to eliminate estrogens, including phytoestrogens, at a normal \r\nrate, and so are retaining a higher percentage of the chemicals consumed \r\nin their diets.  Flavonoids and polyphenols, like our own estrogens, \r\nsuppress the detoxifying systems of the body. Our \r\nbodies produce estrogen in a great variety of tissues, not just in the \r\novaries.  Fat cells are a major source of it.  The tendency \r\nto gain weight after puberty is one of the reasons that women's estrogen \r\nlevels rise with aging throughout the reproductive years, though this \r\nisn't the basic reason for estrogen's lifelong growing influence, even \r\nin men. Our \r\ndiets provide very significant, if not always dangerous, amounts of \r\nestrogen.  Weak estrogens generally have the full range of \r\nharmful estrogenic effects, and often have additional toxic effects.  \r\nAmerican women who eat soy products undergo changes that appear to predispose \r\nthem to cancer, making their tissues even more unlike those of the relatively \r\nbreast-cancer resistant Japanese than they were before eating the soy \r\nfoods. People \r\nunder stress, or who have a thyroid deficiency, or who don't eat enough \r\nprotein, typically have elevated estrogen levels.  The accumulation \r\nof the essential fatty acids, the polyunsaturated oils, in the \r\ntissues promotes the action of estrogen in a variety of ways, and this \r\neffect of diet tends to be cumulative, and to be self-accelerating. Science \r\nis a method that helps us to avoid believing things that are wrong, \r\nbut there is a distinct herd instinct among people who work in science, \r\nwhich makes it easy to believe whatever sounds plausible, if a lot of \r\nother people are saying it is true.  This is just as evident in \r\nphysics as it is in medicine.  Sometimes powerful economic interests \r\nhelp people to change their beliefs, for example as the insurance industry \r\nhelped to convince the public of the dangers of smoking.  Two of \r\nthe biggest industries in the world, the estrogen industry and the soy \r\nbean industry, spend vast amounts of money helping people to believe \r\ncertain plausible-sounding things that help them sell their products.  \r\nSometimes they can achieve great things just by naming the substance. Estrogenicity \r\ncan be defined most simply as acting the way estrogen does, (originally, \r\nthe term estrogen meant producing estrus, the female readiness \r\nto mate) and since our natural estrogen does many things, the definition \r\nis often, for practicality, based on the rapid changes produced in certain \r\nfemale organs by estradiol, specifically, the enlargement of the uterus \r\nby first taking up a large amount of water, and secondarily by the multiplication \r\nof cells and the production of specific proteins.  A similar process \r\noccurring in the breast is also recognized as an important feature of \r\nthe estrogen reaction, but as we try to define just what estrogenicity \r\nis, we see that there is something deeply wrong with this method of \r\ndefining a hormone, because we are constantly learning more about the \r\nactions of estrogen, or of a specific form of the molecule.  Calling \r\nit the female hormone distracted attention from its many functions \r\nin the male, and led to great confusion about its antifertility actions \r\nand its other toxicities.  Many biologists called it folliculin, \r\nbecause of the ovarian follicle's significant role in its production, \r\nbut the pharmaceutical industry succeeded in naming it in relation tooneof its functions, and then in extending that idea of it \r\nas the producer of female receptivity to the even more misleading \r\nidea that it is the female hormone.  But when people speak \r\nabout the estrogenicity of a substance, they mean that it has \r\nproperties that parallel those of folliculin, the particular group \r\nof ovarian hormones that includes estradiol, estrone, and estriol. Over \r\nthe last 100 years, thousands of publications about estrogen's toxicity \r\nhave created a slight resistance to the consumption of the major estrogen \r\nproducts.  One ploy to overcoming this resistance is to call certain \r\nproducts natural estrogen, as distinguished from synthetic \r\nestrogens.  Thethreemain estrogens in our bodies \r\nare estradiol, estrone, and estriol, though there are many other minor \r\nvariants on the basic molecule.These three estrogens, singly \r\nor in combinations, are being sold as natural estrogens, with their \r\nvirtues explained in various ways.  Implicit in many of these explanations, \r\nis the idea that these are safer than synthetics.  They are sometimes \r\ncontrasted to the horse estrogen in Premarin, as if they are better \r\nbecause they are like the estrogens that people produce.  But it \r\nwas exactly the normal human estrogens, produced by the ovaries, that \r\nled to the basic discoveries about the toxicity of estrogen, its ability \r\nto produce cancer in any organ, to cause seizures, blood clots, birth \r\ndefects, accelerated aging, etc. Although \r\nI would suppose that a hormone from a horse might be more natural \r\nfor a person's body than a hormone from a plant, the word natural \r\nas used in the phrases natural food store, or natural medicine, \r\nhas come to be associated strongly with things derived from plants.  \r\nThe health food industry, now largely taken over by giant corporations \r\nto sell products that weren't producing as much revenue when sold in \r\nsupermarkets and drugstores, has helped to create a culture in which \r\nbotanical products are thought to be especially good and safe.  \r\nNaturally grown free-range chickens used to be favored, because they \r\ncould eat anything they wanted, but now eggs laid by factory chickens, \r\neating an industrial corn-and-soy diet, are from vegetarian chickens, \r\nbecause the marketers know the public will favor eggs that have the \r\nvegetarian mystique. Biologically \r\nactive molecules have both general and specific properties.  Estrogenicity \r\nis a general property, but all molecules which have that property also \r\nhave some other specific properties.  Estriol is a little more \r\nwater soluble than estrone, so it interacts with every body system in \r\na slightly different way, entering oily environments with slightly less \r\nease, etc. The \r\nestrogen which occurs in yeasts, estradiol, is identical to the major \r\nhuman estrogen, and it is thought to have a reproductive function in \r\nyeasts, though this isn't really understood.  A feature of this \r\nmolecule, and of all other molecules that act like estrogen, is \r\nthe phenolic function, an oxygen and hydrogen group attached to a resonant \r\nbenzene ring.  Phenol itself is estrogenic, and the phenolic group \r\nis so extremely common in nature that the number of existing estrogenic \r\nsubstances is great, and the number of potential molecules with estrogen-function \r\nis practically infinite. The \r\nphenolic group has many biological functions.  For example, it \r\ncommonly functions as an antioxidant, though something which functions \r\nas an antioxidant in one situation is often a pro-oxidant in another \r\nsituation.  The molecule can have catalytic, germicidal, aromatic, \r\nneurotropic, and other functions.  But it also always has, to some \r\ndegree, the estrogenic function.  This overlap of functions \r\nprobably accounts for why so many plants have significant estrogenic \r\nactivity.  (Natural estrogens, like other phenolics, including \r\nthe flavonoids, are also mutagenic.) The \r\nestrogenic properties of legumes were studied when sheep farmers found \r\nthat their sheep miscarried when they ate clover. (I think it's interesting \r\nhow this terribly toxic effect has been neglected in recent decades.) \r\nAll legumes have this property, and all parts of the plant seem to contain \r\nsome of the active chemicals.  In beans, several substances have \r\nbeen found to contribute to the effect.  The estrogenic effects \r\nof the seed oils and the isoflavones have been studied the most, but \r\nthe well-known antithyroid actions (again, involving the oils, the isoflavones, \r\nand other molecules found in legumes) have an indirect estrogen-promoting \r\naction, since hypothyroidism leads to hyperestrogenism.  (Estrogens \r\nare known to be thyroid suppressors, so the problem tends to be self-accelerating.) The \r\nvarious specific actions of the many estrogenic substances in beans \r\nand other legumes haven't been throughly studied, but there is evidence \r\nthat they are also--like estrogen itself--both mutagenic and carcinogenic. The \r\nestrogen-promoting actions of soy oil apply toall of the commonly \r\nused polyunsaturated fatty acids.  The same fatty acids that suppress \r\nthyroid function, have estrogenic effects. The \r\nisoflavones (many of which are now being promoted as antioxidants \r\nand cancer preventives)  are toxic to many organs, but they \r\nhave clear estrogenic effects, and are active not only immediately in \r\nthe mature individual, but when they are present prenatally, they cause \r\nfeminization of the male genitalia and behavior, and early maturation \r\nof the female offspring, with the tissue changes that are known to be \r\nassociated with increased incidence of cancer. There \r\nare interesting associations between vegetable fiber and estrogens. \r\nBecause of my own experience in finding that eating a raw carrot daily \r\nprevented my migraines, I began to suspect that the carrot fiber was \r\nhaving both a bowel-protective and an antiestrogen effect.  Several \r\nwomen who suffered from premenstrual symptoms, including migraine, had \r\ntheir serum estrogen measured before and after the carrot diet, \r\nand they found that the carrot lowered their estrogen within a few days, \r\nas it relieved their symptoms. Undigestible \r\nfiber, if it isn't broken down by bowel bacteria, increases fecal bulk, \r\nand tends to speed the transit of material through the intestine, just \r\nas laxatives do.  But some of these fiber materials, e.g., \r\nlignin, are themselves estrogenic, and other fibers, by promoting bacterial \r\ngrowth, can promote the conversion of harmless substances into toxins \r\nand carcinogens.  When there is a clear antiestrogen effect \r\nfrom dietary fiber, it seems to be the result of accelerated transit \r\nthrough the intestine, speeding elimination and preventing reabsorption \r\nof the estrogen which has been excreted in the bile.  Laxatives \r\nhave this same effect on the excretion of estradiol. Some \r\nof the isoflavones, lignins, and other phytoestrogens are said to prevent \r\nbowel cancer, but some of them, e.g., lignin, appear to sometimes increase \r\nits likelihood. The \r\nphytoestrogens appear to pose a risk to organs besides the breast and \r\nuterus, for example the liver, colon, and pancreas, which isn't surprising, \r\nsince estrogen is known to be carcinogenic for every tissue.  And \r\ncarcinogenesis, like precancerous changes, mutations, and reduced repair \r\nof DNA, is probably just an incidental process in the more general toxic \r\neffect of acceleration of aging. © Ray Peat 2008.

        "chunk_html": "Tissue-bound estrogen in agingThe \"Estrogen \r\nReplacement\" industry is based on the doctrine that a woman's tissues \r\nare depleted of estrogen after menopause. This doctrine is false. The concentration \r\nof a hormone in the blood doesn't directly represent the concentration \r\nin the various organs. The amount \r\nof estrogen in tissue is decreased when progesterone is abundant. In \r\nthe absence of progesterone, tissues retain estrogen even when there \r\nis little estrogen circulating in the blood. Many things \r\nsuggest an increased estrogenic activity at menopause. For example, \r\nmelatonin decreases sharply at puberty when estrogen increases, and \r\nthen it decreases again at menopause. \r\nProlactin (stimulated by estrogen) increases around puberty, and instead \r\nof decreasing at menopause, it often increases, and its increase is \r\nassociated with osteoporosis and other age-related symptoms. Estrogen \r\nis produced in many tissues by the enzyme \r\naromatase, even in the breast and endometrium, although these are considered \r\n\"target tissues\" rather than endocrine glands. \r\nAromatase increases with aging. Estrogen \r\nis inactivated, mainly in the liver and brain, by being made water soluble \r\nby the attachment of glucuronic acid and/or sulfuric acid. Estrogen's \r\nconcentration in a particular tissue depends on many things, including \r\nits affinity or binding strength for components of that tissue, relative \r\nto its affinity for the blood; the activity in that tissue of the \r\naromatase enzyme, which converts androgens to estrogen; the activity \r\nof the glucuronidase enzyme, that converts water-soluble estrogen \r\nglucuronides into the oil soluble active forms of estrogen; and the \r\nsulfatases and several other enzymes that modify the activity and solubility \r\nof the estrogens. The \"estrogen receptors,\" proteins which bind \r\nestrogens in cells, are inactivated by progesterone, and activated by \r\nmany physical and chemical conditions. Inflammation \r\nactivates beta-glucuronidase, and antiinflammatory substances such as \r\naspirin reduce many of estrogen's effects. Doctrines \r\nare admitted into the \"scientific canon\" by those who have \r\nthe power of censorship. In astronomy, Halton Arp's discovery of \"anomalous\" \r\n\r\ngalactic red-shifts is practically unknown, because the journal editors \r\nsay the observations are \"just anomalies,\" or that the theories \r\nwhich could explain them are unconventional; but the actual problem \r\nis that they are strong evidence against The Big Bang, Hubble's Law, \r\nand the Expanding Universe. American science, since the 1940s, has probably \r\nbeen the most censored and doctrinaire in the world. Gilbert \r\nLing's revolution in cell biology remains outside the canon, despite \r\nthe profound influence of MRI, which grew directly out of his view of \r\nthe cell, because his work provided conclusive evidence that cells are \r\nnot regulated by \"semipermeable membranes and membrane pumps.\" \r\nEvery field of science is ruled by a doctrinaire establishment. Charles \r\nE. Brown-Séquard (1817-94) was a physiologist who pioneered scientific \r\nendocrinology, but who was ridiculed because of his claim that extracts \r\nof animal glands had an invigorating effect when injected. His place \r\nin the scientific canon is mainly as an object of ridicule, and the \r\ndetails of his case are perfectly representative of the way our canon \r\nhas been constructed. The argument for dismissing his observations was \r\nthat he used a water extract of testicles, and, according to the 20th \r\ncentury American biologists, testosterone is not water soluble, and \r\nso the water extract would have contained no hormone. The argument \r\nis foolish, because living organs contain innumerable substances that \r\nwill solublize oily molecules, but also because Brown-Sequard was describing \r\nan effect that wasnt necessarily limited to a single chemical substance. \r\n(The transplanting of living cells to repair tissues is finally being \r\naccepted, but the pioneers in promoting tissue regeneration or repair \r\nwith the transplantation of living, dead, or stressed cells--V. Filatov, \r\nL.V. Polezhaev, W.T. Summerlin, for example--were simply written out \r\nof history.) If \r\nBrown-Séquards extract couldnt work because testosterone isnt \r\nsoluble in water, then what are we to think of the thousands of medical \r\npublications that talk about free hormones as the only active \r\nhormones? (Free hormone is defined as the hormone that isnt \r\nbound to a transporting protein, with the more or less explicit idea \r\nthat it is dissolved in the water of the plasma or extracellular fluid.) \r\nBrown-Séquards tissue extracts would have contained solublizing \r\nsubstances including proteins and phospholipids, so the oily hormones \r\nwould certainly be present (and active) in his extracts. But the thousands \r\nof people who ridiculed him committed themselves to the fact that steroid \r\nhormones are insoluble in water. By their own standard, they are selling \r\nan impossibility when they do calculations to reveal the amount of free \r\nhormone, as something distinct from the protein bound hormone, in \r\nthe patients blood. The \r\nimmense Hormone Replacement Therapy industry--which \r\nBrown-Séquards experiments foreshadowed--is based on the fact that \r\nthe concentrations of some hormones in the blood serum decrease with \r\naging. At \r\nfirst, it was assumed that the amount of the hormone in the blood corresponded \r\nto the effectiveness of that hormone. Whatever was in the blood was \r\nbeing delivered to the target tissues. But as the idea of measuring \r\nprotein bound iodine (PBI) to determine thyroid function came \r\ninto disrepute (because it never had a scientific basis at all), new \r\nideas of measuring active hormones came into the marketplace, \r\nand currently the doctrine is that the bound hormones are inactive, \r\nand the active hormones are free. The free hormones are \r\nsupposed to be the only ones that can get into the cells to deliver \r\ntheir signals, but the problem is that free hormones exist only \r\nin the imagination of people who interpret certain lab tests, as I discussed \r\nin the newsletter on thyroid tests (May, 2000). In \r\nthe 1960s and 1970s, when the PBI test was disappearing, there was intense \r\ninterest in--a kind of mania regarding--the role of membranes \r\nin regulating cell functions, and the membrane was still seen by most \r\nbiologists as the semipermeable membrane which, obviously, \r\nwould exclude molecules as large as albumin and the other proteins that \r\ncarry thyroid and other hormones in the blood. (In reality, and experimental \r\nobservations, albumin and other proteins enter cells more or less freely, \r\ndepending on prevailing conditions.) The membrane doctrine led directly \r\nto the free hormone doctrine. This \r\nissue, of arguing about which form of a hormone is the active \r\nform, has to do with explaining how much of the blood-carried hormone \r\nis going to get into the target tissues. If the membrane is a \r\nsemipermeable barrier to molecules such as hormones, then specific \r\nreceptors and transporters will be needed. If the concentration of a \r\nhormone inside the cell is higher than that in the blood, a pump \r\nwill usually be invoked, to produce an active transport of the \r\nhormone against its concentration gradient. But \r\nif the membrane regulates the passage of hormones from blood to tissue \r\ncells, and especially if pumps are needed to move the hormone into the \r\ncell, how relevant is the measurement of hormones in the blood? Within \r\nthe blood, progesterone and thyroid hormone (T3) are much more concentrated \r\nin the red blood cells than in the serum. Since it isnt likely that \r\nred blood cells are targets for the sex hormones, or for progesterone \r\nor even thyroid, their concentration against their gradient in \r\nthese cells suggests that a simple distribution by solubility is involved. \r\nOily substances just naturally tend to concentrate inside cells because \r\nof their insolubility in the watery environment of the plasma and extracellular \r\nfluid. Proteins that have oily regions effectively bind oily molecules, \r\nsuch as fats and steroids. Even red blood cells have such proteins. In \r\nthe case of oil soluble molecules, such as progesterone and estrogen, \r\nits important to explain that most of their binding to proteins \r\nor other oil-loving molecules is really the nearly passive consequence \r\nof the molecules being forced away from the watery phase--they are \r\nhydrophobic, and although it would take a great amount of energy to \r\nmake these insoluble substances enter the watery phase, the attractive \r\nforce between them and the cell is usually small. This means that they \r\ncan be freely mobile, while bound or concentrated within the cell. \r\nThe oxygen atoms, and especially the phenolic group of estrogen, slightly \r\nreduce the hormones affinity for simple oils, but they interact with \r\nother polar or aromatic groups, giving estrogen the ability to bind \r\nmore strongly and specifically with some proteins and other molecules. \r\nEnzymes which catalyze estrogens oxidation-reduction actions are \r\namong the specific estrogen-binding proteins. Many \r\nproteins and lipoproteins bind steroids, but some intracellular proteins \r\nbind them so strongly that they have been--in \r\na very teleological, if not anthropomorphic, way--considered as the \r\nswitch by which the hormone turns on the cellular response. In the popular \r\ndoctrine of the Estrogen Receptor, a few molecules of estrogen bind \r\nto the receptors, which carry them to the nucleus of the cell, where \r\nthe activated receptors turn on the genes in charge of the female response. \r\n(Or the male response, or the growth response, or the atrophy response, \r\nor whatever genetic response estrogen is producing.) Once the switch \r\nhas been thrown, the estrogen molecules have fulfilled their hormonal \r\nduty, and must get lost, so that the response isnt perpetuated indefinitely \r\nby a few molecules. Although \r\nthe Estrogen Receptor doctrine is worse than silly, there are real proteins \r\nwhich bind estrogen, and some of these are called receptors. The uterus, \r\nbreast, and brain, which are very responsive to estrogen, bind, or concentrate, \r\nestrogen molecules. When \r\nI was working on my dissertation, I tried to extract estrogens from \r\nhamster uteri, but the chemical techniques I was using to measure estrogen \r\nwerent accurate for such small quantities. A few years later, S. \r\nBatra was able to extract the estrogen from human tissue in quantities \r\nlarge enough for accurate analysis by radioimmunoassay. (Batra, 1976.) His \r\ncrucial observation was that the difference in estrogen concentration \r\nbetween tissue and blood was lowest in the luteal phase, when progesterone \r\nis high: The \r\ntissue/plasma ratio of E2 [estradiol] ranged from1.45 to 20.36 \r\nwith very high values in early follicular phase and the lowest in \r\nmid-luteal phase.This means that progesterone prevents the tissue \r\nfrom concentrating estrogen. He made similar observations during pregnancy,with tissue estrogen decreasing as blood progesterone increased, so \r\nthatthere is less estrogen in the tissue than in the plasma.But in women who arent pregnant, and when their progesterone is low, \r\nthe tissues may contain 20 to 30 times more estrogen than the plasma \r\n(in equal volumes). In \r\naging, the sharply decreased progesterone production creates a situation \r\nresembling the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, allowing tissues \r\nto concentrate estrogen even when the serum estrogen may be low.  In \r\npostmenopausal women, the tissue concentration of E2 was not significantly \r\nlower than in menstruating women in follicular phase. . . . (Akerlund, \r\net al., 1981.) Besides \r\nthe relatively direct actions of progesterone on the estrogen receptors, \r\nkeeping their concentration low, and its indirect action by preventing \r\nprolactin from stimulating the formation of estrogen receptors, there \r\nare many other processes that can increase or decrease the tissue concentration \r\nof estrogen, and many of these influences change with aging. There \r\nare two kinds of enzyme that produce estrogen. Aromatase converts male \r\nhormones into estrogen. Beta-glucuronidase converts the inactive estrogen-glucuronides \r\ninto active estrogen. The healthy liver inactivates practically all \r\nthe estrogen that reaches it, mostly by combining it with the sugar \r\nacid, glucuronic acid. This makes the estrogen water soluble, and \r\nit is quickly eliminated in the urine. But when it passes through inflamed \r\ntissue, these tissues contain large amounts of beta-glucuronidase, which \r\nwill remove the glucuronic acid, leaving the pure estrogen to accumulate \r\nin the tissue. Many \r\nkinds of liver impairment decrease its ability to excrete estrogen, \r\nand estrogen contributes to a variety of liver diseases. The work of \r\nthe Biskinds in the 1940s showed that a dietary protein deficiency prevented \r\nthe liver from detoxifying estrogen. Hypothyroidism prevents the liver \r\nfrom attaching glucuronic acid to estrogen, and so increases the bodys \r\nretention of estrogen, which in turn impairs the thyroid glands ability \r\nto secrete thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism often results from nutritional \r\nprotein deficiency. Although \r\nwe commonly think of the ovaries as the main source of estrogen, the \r\nenzyme which makes it can be found in all parts of the body. Surprisingly, \r\nin rhesus monkeys, aromatase in the arms accounts for a very large part \r\nof estrogen production. Fat and the skin are major sources of estrogen, \r\nespecially in older people.The activity of \r\naromatase increases with aging, and under the influence of \r\nprolactin, cortisol, prostaglandin, and the pituitary hormones, \r\nFSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and growth hormone.It is \r\ninhibited by progesterone, thyroid, aspirin, and high altitude.Aromatase can produce estrogen in fat cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle \r\ncells, breast and uterine tissue, pancreas, liver, brain, bone, skin, \r\netc. Its action in breast cancer, endometriosis, uterine cancer, lupus, \r\ngynecomastia, and many other diseases is especially important. Aromatase \r\nin mammary tissue appears to increase estrogen receptors and cause breast neoplasia, independently of ovarian \r\nestrogen (Tekmal, et al., 1999). Women \r\nwho have had their ovaries removed are usually told that they need to \r\ntake estrogen, but animal experiments consistently show that removal \r\nof the gonads causes the tissue aromatases to increase. The loss of \r\nprogesterone and ovarian androgens is probably responsible for this \r\ngeneralized increase in the formation of estrogen. In the brain, aromatase \r\nincreases under the influence of estrogen treatment. Sulfatase \r\nis another enzyme that releases estrogen in tissues, and its activity \r\nis inhibited by antiestrogenic hormones. In \r\nat least some tissues, progesterone inhibits the release or activation \r\nof beta-glucuronidase (which, according to Cristofalo and Kabakjian, \r\n1975, increases with aging). Glucaric acid, which inhibits this enzyme, \r\nis being used to treat breast cancer, and glucuronic acid also tends \r\nto inhibit the intracellular release of estrogen by beta-glucuronidase. Although \r\nthere is clearly a trend toward the rational use of antiestrogenic treatments \r\nfor breast cancer, in other diseases the myth of estrogen deficiency \r\nstill prevents even rudimentary approaches. Ever \r\nsince Lipshutz work in the 1940s, it has been established that theuninterruptedeffect of a little estrogen is more harmful than \r\nlarger but intermittent exposures. But after menopause, when progesterone \r\nstops its cyclic displacement of estrogen from the tissues, the tissues \r\nretain large amounts of estrogen continuously. The \r\nmenopause itself is produced by the prolonged exposure to estrogen beginning \r\nin puberty, in spite of the monthly protection of the progesterone produced \r\nby cycling ovaries. The unopposed action of the high concentration of \r\ntissue-bound estrogen after menopause must be even more harmful. The \r\ndecline of the antiestrogenic factors in aging, combined with the increase \r\nof pro-estrogenic factors such as cortisol and prolactin and FSH, occurs \r\nin both men and women. During the reproductive years, womens cyclic \r\nproduction of large amounts of progesterone probably retards their aging \r\nenough to account for their greater longevity. Childbearing \r\nalso has a residual antiestrogenic effect and is associated with increased \r\nlongevity. Being \r\naware of this pervasive increase in estrogen exposure with aging should \r\nmake it possible to marshal a comprehensive set of methods for opposing \r\nthat trend toward degeneration. © Ray Peat 2006.

        "chunk_html": "Suitable \r\nFats, Unsuitable Fats: Issues in NutritionFor \r\nfifty years, the mass media have been making the public think about \r\nthe fats in their diet, filling the culture with clichés about bad \r\nsaturated animal fats that raise cholesterol, or lately the trans-fats \r\nin margarine, and images of arteries clogged by bad fats. The public \r\ninstruction about the fats we should eat resembles the owner's manual \r\nfor a car, that tells you what kind of motor oil and fuel and coolant \r\nto use; they are telling us that they know how our body works, and that \r\nthey know what it needs. But now, even after the human genome has supposedly \r\nbeen partly \"decoded,\" the biological functions of the fats \r\nhave hardly begun to be investigated.To \r\nunderstand the present issues regarding fats in nutrition and medicine \r\nit's helpful to look at the historical development of biochemical and \r\nphysiological fat research in a variety of contexts, including agriculture \r\nand economics, as well as considering the effects of the changing ideas \r\nabout cell structure, vitamins, hormones, immunology, brain development, \r\nevolution, and the growing understanding of the way physiology interacts \r\nwith ecology. We need to recognize the complexity of the physiology \r\nof fats, to appreciate the complexity of the living organism.Financial \r\nconsiderations have driven fat research in very obvious ways. In 1883, \r\nMark Twain described how commercial fraud was making use of new technology \r\nto substitute cheap fats and oils for butter and olive oil.. Hard fats \r\nsuch as tallow, which had been used for making soap and candles, began \r\nto be widely used as a substitute for butter in the 19th century. Around \r\n1912, chemists found economical ways to solidify (for use as a butter \r\nsubstitute) the very cheap liquid oils, such as cottonseed oil, linseed \r\noil, whale oil, and fish oils, which been used mostly as fuels or varnish. \r\nThe seed oils were so cheap that meat packers quickly became major producers \r\nof hydrogenated cottonseed and soy oils, to extend their limited supply \r\nof lard or tallow for sale as shortening or margarine.Between \r\n1912 and 1927 there were several studies that reported that animals \r\ncould live on a fat-free diet, and that in fact they lived longer, and \r\nwithout the normal mortality from cancer. In the 1940s and 1950s, most \r\ntextbooks that mentioned the idea that certain fats were essential nutrients \r\ndescribed it as a controversial idea. But the oil industries used public \r\nrelations effectively to sell the medical (heart protective) benefits \r\nof a diet containing increased amounts of linoleic and linolenic acids, \r\nwhich they called the essential fatty acids. They began citing a 1929 \r\npublication (by G. Burr and M. Burr) that claimed to demonstrate the \r\nessentiality of those fatty acids, while ignoring the publications that \r\npointed in different directions.The \r\ncheapness of the seed oils led to their use in animal feeds, to promote \r\ngrowth. By the 1940s, the polyunsaturated oils, including fish oils, \r\nwere known to cause deterioration of the brain, muscles, and gonads \r\nin a variety of animals, and this was found to be caused mainly by their \r\ndestruction of vitamin E. A little later, the disease called steatitis \r\nor yellow fat disease was found to be produced in various animals that \r\nwere fed too much fish or fish oil.The \r\nreason linseed oil and fish oil were used for making varnishes and paints \r\nwas that they are \"drying oils,\" reacting with oxygen to polymerize \r\nand harden. The physical and chemical propertiess of the oils are fairly \r\nwell understood, and among the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) the \r\nomega -3 fatty acids react most easily with oxygen. Heat, light, and \r\nmoisture increase their spontaneous interactions with oxygen, and besides \r\npolymerizing, these oils produce a variety of reactive particles, including \r\nacrolein, which combine with other substances, such as cellular proteins \r\nand DNA, with highly toxic effects. At low temperatures and low oxygen \r\nconcentrations these oils are not highly reactive. Fats that harden \r\nat low temperatures (as saturated fats do) wouldn't be convenient for \r\norganisms that live in a cool environment, and so organisms regulate \r\nthe type of fat they synthesize according to the temperature of their \r\ntissues. The fact that certain types of polyunsaturated fatty acids \r\nfunction nicely in fish, worms, and insects, doesn't mean that they \r\nare ideal fats for mammals.The \r\nfact that vitamin E prevented or cured some of the major diseases in \r\nfarm animals caused by excessive PUFA, and that it could retard the \r\ndevelopment of rancidity in stored oils, led quickly to the persistent \r\nbelief that lipid peroxidation is the only toxic effect of the vegetable \r\noils. However, the oils were being seen to cause other problems, including \r\naccelerated aging and obesity, but those problems weren't of interest \r\nto farmers, who wanted to sell plump young animals as cheaply and quickly \r\nas possible. Even fresh oils have toxic effects, and the oxidative damage \r\nthey do is often the consequence of these other toxic actions.Another \r\ncheap food additive, coconut oil, was found to increase feed consumption \r\nwhile slowing weight gain, so it wasn't popular in the meat industry. \r\nThe highly unsaturated seed oils had the opposite effect, of producing \r\na rapid fattening of the animal, while decreasing feed consumption, \r\nso by 1950 corn and soybeans were widely considered to be optimal feeds \r\nfor maximizing profits in the production of meat animals. It was at \r\nthis time that the industry found that it could market the liquid oils \r\ndirectly to consumers, as health-promoting foods, without bothering \r\nto turn them into solid shortening or margarine. Somehow, few physiologists \r\ncontinued to think about the implications of metabolic slowing, obesity, \r\nand the related degenerative diseases.As \r\nvitamin research advanced in the 1940s, Roger Williams' lab at the Clayton \r\nFoundation Biochemical Institute, University of Texas at Austin, recognized \r\nthe \"fat deficiency disease\" of the Burrs as a deficiency \r\nof vitamin B6, and showed that when they produced the condition with \r\na diet similar to the one the Burrs had used, they could cure it by \r\nadministering vitamin B6. In the early 1930s George Burr had discovered \r\nthat animals on a fat free diet had an extremely high rate of metabolism, \r\nbut he didn't investigate the important ramifications of that observation, \r\nsuch as their increased need for vitamins and minerals, in accordance \r\nwith their rate of metabolism. The PUFA slowed metabolism, and that \r\neffect was good for agriculture.The \r\ncommercial pressure on fat research has created a new way of writing \r\nresearch reports, that several decades earlier wouldn't have been acceptable. \r\nFor example, the effects of a specific fat on a few of the components \r\nof a complex process such as clotting are often described in the title, \r\nintroduction, and conclusion of an article as if they were revealing \r\na way to prevent heart disease. The effects of unsaturated fats on cellsin vitroare often the opposite of their effects in living animals, \r\nbut editors are allowing authors to claim that theirin vitroresults justify dietary or therapeutic use of the fats. Journals of \r\nmedicine and nutrition are now preferred sites for commercial press \r\nreleases, composed to superficially resemble scientific reports.The \r\nsuppressive effects of unsaturated fats on mitochondrial energy production \r\nhave been widely investigated, since it is that effect that makes animal \r\nfattening with PUFA so economical. Rather than interpreting that as \r\na toxic effect, using the innate structure and function of the mitochondrion \r\nas a point of reference from which to evaluate dietary components, the \r\nconsumption of \"good\" oils is being used as the reference \r\npoint from which to evaluate the meaning of metabolism (\"efficiency \r\nis good,\" \"low oxygen consumption is good\"). Building \r\non the idea that the oils are health-promoters which increase metabolic \r\nefficiency, the never-viable \"rate of aging\" theory was resuscitated: \r\nThe anti-respiratory effect of PUFA is used (illogically) to return \r\nto the idea that aging occurs in proportion to the amount of oxygen \r\nconsumed, because animals which lack the supposedly essential nutrients \r\n(\"defective animals\") consume oxygen rapidly--burning calories \r\nrapidly, they are supposed to be like a candle that won't last as long \r\nif it burns intensely. The old theory is simply resuscitated to explain \r\nwhy the anti-respiratory action of PUFA might be beneficial, justifying \r\nfurther promotion of their use as food and drugs.Ordinarily, \r\nin biochemistry and physiology the inhibition of an enzyme is taken \r\nas a suggestion of toxicity, but when the point of reference is the \r\nidea of the goodness of PUFA, theactivityof an intrinsic enzyme \r\nis taken to be evidence of harm, and itsinhibition(by PUFA) \r\nis taken to be the proper, healthful situation. The enzyme that produces \r\nthe Mead fatty acid is strongly inhibited by PUFA seed oils (less strongly \r\nby fish oils), and so the presence of the Mead acid in the tissues is \r\ntaken as evidence that the animal is suffering damage resulting from \r\nthe absence of PUFA. The Mead acid happens to have some valuable anti-inflammatory \r\neffects, and is associated with many biological advantages, but research \r\nin that direction is prevented by the lack of funding.By \r\n1920, the polyunsaturated fatty acids were recognized to inhibit proteolytic \r\nenzymes. At that time, the production of unsaturated fat was considered \r\nto be a feature of certain pathogens, able to overcome the proteolytic-phagocytic \r\nfunctions of the immune system.Scattered \r\nstudies have found that polyunsaturated fats inhibit the proteolytic \r\nenzymes involved in the digestion of food, in the removal of clots, \r\nin the formation of thyroid hormone, and many other essential physiological \r\nprocesses. But currently, the only implication being drawn from this \r\nbroad class of effects of the PUFA is that some proteolytic enzymes \r\nare involved in disease processes, and consequently increased consumption \r\nof PUFA would be appropriate, because of their ability to suppress a \r\nconditionally harmful proteolytic enzyme. Since the organism consists \r\nmainly of proteins, there are complex innate systems for regulating \r\nthe proteolytic enzymes, activating or inactivating them as needed, \r\nand such complexity isn't likely to depend on variable, unstable dietary \r\nfactors. Exogenous substances that inhibit some proteases could create \r\nan unlimited variety of functional and anatomical irregularities.Some \r\nof the interesting enzymes affected specifically by polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids are those involved in hormone production. While they inhibit \r\nthe formation of progesterone and androgens, they activate the synthesis \r\nof estrogen, which in turn activates the release of more free polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids from the tissues, in a positive feedback pattern.The \r\ninhibition of detoxification enzymes by PUFA (Tsoutsikos, et al., 2004) \r\naffects many processes, such as the elimination of estrogen, contributing \r\nto the positive feedback between estrogen and the oils. The meaning \r\nof this tends to be lost, because of the estrogen industry's effective \r\ncampaigns.Another \r\nsituation in which fatty acids participate in a positive feedback system \r\nis the stress reaction, in which the released fatty acids impair mitochondrial \r\nenergy production, increasing the stress and leading to further release \r\nof fatty acids.One \r\nof the perennial theories of aging that has remained viable is the metaplasm/lipofuscin/age \r\npigment theory, the idea that a toxic material accumulates in tissues \r\nover time. The age pigment contains proteins, cross-linked PUFA, and \r\nmetals. The inhibition of proteolytic enzymes is involved in its accumulation, \r\nand the ratio of PUFA to saturated fatty acids is an important factor \r\nin its formation. Estrogen is one of the factors that can promote the \r\nformation of age pigment, probably partly because its lipolytic action \r\nincreases the cells' exposure to free fatty acids. The lipofuscin contributes \r\nto inhibition of proteolysis, probably partly through increased production \r\nof free radicals and hydrogen peroxide.The \r\nproteolytic enzymes are an essential part of innate immunity, and the \r\nhighly unsaturated fatty acid, EPA, which is the most immunosuppressive \r\nof the fats, strongly inhibits proteolysis in some cells. The natural \r\nkiller (NK) cells and phagocytic cells are two types of cell that are \r\nsuppressed by PUFA, and they are involved in many kinds of physiological \r\nevents, not just the killing of tumor cells and virus infected cells.The \r\nimmunosuppressive effects of PUFA are very general. Many metabolites \r\nthat are known to have harmful effects on the immune system are increased \r\nby the PUFA (histamine [Masini, et al., 1990], serotonin, lactate, nitric \r\noxide [Omura, et al., 2001]). These substances are also involved in \r\ntumor development.Besides \r\ninhibiting enzymes and being converted into prostaglandins, the polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids have direct effects, as signals (or interference with signals) \r\non many tissues. The belief that the PUFA are essential nutrients has \r\ninfluenced the way cellular excitability thresholds are being interpreted. \r\nAnxiety and panic may be interpreted as alertness, calmness may be interpreted \r\nas stupidity. Specifically, long-term potentiation (LTP) may contribute \r\nto seizures, senility, and excitotoxicity, as well as to learning, but \r\nmany titles and conclusions equate increased LTP with \"improved \r\nLTP,\" implying that it has biological value to the animal.The \r\nability of nerve cells to become quiescent after excitation is essential \r\nto learning and perception. This ability is lost with aging, as the \r\nfunctional balance in the brain shifts away from GABA-ergic to glutamatergic \r\nnerves. The polyunsaturated fatty acids promote the excitatory nervous \r\nstate. The combination of respiratory inhibition with excitation can \r\nproduce excitotoxic cell death. If the doctrine of \"essentiality \r\nof PUFA\" hadn't been so influential, different interpretations \r\nof excitatory thresholds, energy metabolism, and even cell structure \r\nwould have been allowed to develop more fully.The \r\nconcentration of polyunsaturated fats in the brain has led many people \r\nto say that the \"nutritionally essential fatty acids,\" especially \r\nthe omega -3 fatty acids, are essential for brain development (for the \r\nformation of nerve cell membranes), and for the formation of synapses, \r\nand that increasing the amount of those fats in the diet would be desirable. \r\nThe types of argument they use simply ignore the real evidence:Cells can multiply indefinitely in culture dishes without the essential \r\nfatty acids, insects can multiply for generations on diets without the \r\nunsaturated fats, forming normal synapses and brains, and mammals fed \r\ndiets with extremely small amounts of the unsaturated fats grow with \r\nperfectly normal--possibly superior--brains.One \r\nof the fats in the omega -9 series, that the human body can synthesize, \r\nnervonic acid, is a major constituent of brain tissue, but its important \r\nfunctions in brain development have hardly been investigated. Unlike \r\nthe unsaturated fatty acids oleic acid, linoleic acid, and eicosapentaenoic \r\nacid (EPA), nervonic acid isn't associated with the \"coronary risk \r\nfactors,\" and it has been suggested that it might be used in adults \r\nto prevent obesity-related diseases. (Oda, et al., 2005).One \r\nmajor area of research that has been neglected involves the role of \r\nfats in modifying the ways in which proteins and nucleic acids interact \r\nwith water--arguably the most basic of all physiological processes. \r\nUnsaturated fats are more water soluble than saturated fats, and they \r\nare involved in many problems of permeability and edema.In \r\naging and evolution, there are systematic changes in tissue water content \r\nthat appear to correspond to changes in rate of metabolism, to the degree \r\nof unsaturation of cellular fats, and to thyroid function and temperature. \r\nMetabolic intensity and longevity can be modified by changing the degree \r\nof saturation of fats in the diet and tissues, but--despite almost a \r\ncentury of sporadic investigations--no one has yet worked out in detail \r\nthe most appropriate way to do this. But it has become clear that the \r\n\"uncoupled\" mitochondrion, that \"wastes oxygen and calories,\" \r\n\r\nis protective against free radicals, cancer, and aging. Thyroid hormone \r\nand the absence of PUFA are important factors in supporting the \"wasteful\" \r\nmitochondrion.Although \r\nthe complex interactions of anatomy, energy, temperature, fat nutrition, \r\ntissue water content, and hormones haven't been systematically investigated, \r\nsome of the principles regarding the biological suitability of specific \r\nfats are already being applied in the limited context of therapy.At \r\npresent, the most important issue is to recognize the dangers presented \r\nby the intrusion of corporate power into science, especially as it relates \r\nto nutrition and medicine, and to consider the implications of the known \r\neffects of the PUFA on all of our biological systems.The \r\nfood-derived polyunsaturated fatty acids play important roles in the \r\ndevelopment of all of the problems associated with aging--reduced immunity, \r\ninsomnia, decreased learning ability, substitution of fat for muscle, \r\nsusceptibility to tissue peroxidation and inflammation, growth of tumors, \r\netc., and are probably involved in most other health problems, even \r\nin children. If research hadn't been guided by the economic interests \r\nof the seed oil industry, many of those problems would have been solved \r\nby now.The \r\ninfluence of the mass media on science can be seen in two issues that \r\nare currently well known.A \r\npopular test used for evaluating diabetes is the measurement of glycated \r\nhemoglobin, the attachment of a sugar-like fragment to the protein of \r\nhemoglobin. This is used to judge whether blood sugar is being controlled \r\nadequately. The glycation of proteins is widely believed to be a central \r\nprocess in aging, and is often used to argue that people should reduce \r\ntheir sugar consumption.Another \r\nwell publicized problem supposedly involving the reaction between sugars \r\nand proteins has to do with the discovery of the carcinogen, acrylamide, \r\nin breads and french fries. The Whole Foods Market was sued in California \r\nfor selling whole wheat bread without a warning that it contained a \r\ncarcinogen.But \r\nthe changes in proteins that occur in diabetes are mainly produced by \r\nthe breakdown products of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Acrylamide is \r\nproduced largely by the reaction of PUFA with proteins.Sugar, \r\nby reducing the level of free fatty acids in the body, actually tends \r\nto protect against these toxic effects of the PUFA. Diabetes, like cancer, \r\nhas been known for a long time to be promoted by unsaturated oils in \r\nthe diet, rather than by sugar. The seed oil industry has been more \r\neffective than the sugar industry in lobbying and advertising, and the \r\neffects can be seen in the assumptions that shape medical and biological \r\nresearch.REFERENCESBiochem \r\nPharmacol. 1990 Mar 1;39(5):879-89.Histamine release from rat mast \r\ncells induced by metabolic activation of polyunsaturated fatty acids \r\ninto free radicals.Masini E, Palmerani B, Gambassi F, Pistelli \r\nA, Giannella E, Occupati B, Ciuffi M, Sacchi TB, Mannaioni PF.Int \r\nHeart J. 2005 Nov;46(6):975-85.Relationships between serum unsaturated \r\nfatty acids and coronary risk factors: negative relations between nervonic \r\nacid and obesity-related risk factors.Oda E, Hatada K, Kimura J, \r\nAizawa Y, Thanikachalam PV, Watanabe K. \"The objective of the present \r\nstudy was to analyze the relationships between serum USFA and CRF [coronary \r\nrisk factors].\" \"Oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA), and \r\neicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were positively related to coronary risk \r\nfactors (total CRFS = 2, 3, and 4, respectively), while nervonic acid \r\n(NA) exerted negative effects on these risk factors (total CRFS = -6 \r\n).

All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com For \r\nfifty years, the mass media have been making the public think about \r\nthe fats in their diet, filling the culture with clichés about bad \r\nsaturated animal fats that raise cholesterol, or lately the trans-fats \r\nin margarine, and images of arteries clogged by bad fats. The public \r\ninstruction about the fats we should eat resembles the owner's manual \r\nfor a car, that tells you what kind of motor oil and fuel and coolant \r\nto use; they are telling us that they know how our body works, and that \r\nthey know what it needs. But now, even after the human genome has supposedly \r\nbeen partly \"decoded,\" the biological functions of the fats \r\nhave hardly begun to be investigated. To \r\nunderstand the present issues regarding fats in nutrition and medicine \r\nit's helpful to look at the historical development of biochemical and \r\nphysiological fat research in a variety of contexts, including agriculture \r\nand economics, as well as considering the effects of the changing ideas \r\nabout cell structure, vitamins, hormones, immunology, brain development, \r\nevolution, and the growing understanding of the way physiology interacts \r\nwith ecology. We need to recognize the complexity of the physiology \r\nof fats, to appreciate the complexity of the living organism. Financial \r\nconsiderations have driven fat research in very obvious ways. In 1883, \r\nMark Twain described how commercial fraud was making use of new technology \r\nto substitute cheap fats and oils for butter and olive oil.. Hard fats \r\nsuch as tallow, which had been used for making soap and candles, began \r\nto be widely used as a substitute for butter in the 19th century. Around \r\n1912, chemists found economical ways to solidify (for use as a butter \r\nsubstitute) the very cheap liquid oils, such as cottonseed oil, linseed \r\noil, whale oil, and fish oils, which been used mostly as fuels or varnish. \r\nThe seed oils were so cheap that meat packers quickly became major producers \r\nof hydrogenated cottonseed and soy oils, to extend their limited supply \r\nof lard or tallow for sale as shortening or margarine. Between \r\n1912 and 1927 there were several studies that reported that animals \r\ncould live on a fat-free diet, and that in fact they lived longer, and \r\nwithout the normal mortality from cancer. In the 1940s and 1950s, most \r\ntextbooks that mentioned the idea that certain fats were essential nutrients \r\ndescribed it as a controversial idea. But the oil industries used public \r\nrelations effectively to sell the medical (heart protective) benefits \r\nof a diet containing increased amounts of linoleic and linolenic acids, \r\nwhich they called the essential fatty acids. They began citing a 1929 \r\npublication (by G. Burr and M. Burr) that claimed to demonstrate the \r\nessentiality of those fatty acids, while ignoring the publications that \r\npointed in different directions. The \r\ncheapness of the seed oils led to their use in animal feeds, to promote \r\ngrowth. By the 1940s, the polyunsaturated oils, including fish oils, \r\nwere known to cause deterioration of the brain, muscles, and gonads \r\nin a variety of animals, and this was found to be caused mainly by their \r\ndestruction of vitamin E. A little later, the disease called steatitis \r\nor yellow fat disease was found to be produced in various animals that \r\nwere fed too much fish or fish oil. The \r\nreason linseed oil and fish oil were used for making varnishes and paints \r\nwas that they are \"drying oils,\" reacting with oxygen to polymerize \r\nand harden. The physical and chemical propertiess of the oils are fairly \r\nwell understood, and among the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) the \r\nomega -3 fatty acids react most easily with oxygen. Heat, light, and \r\nmoisture increase their spontaneous interactions with oxygen, and besides \r\npolymerizing, these oils produce a variety of reactive particles, including \r\nacrolein, which combine with other substances, such as cellular proteins \r\nand DNA, with highly toxic effects. At low temperatures and low oxygen \r\nconcentrations these oils are not highly reactive. Fats that harden \r\nat low temperatures (as saturated fats do) wouldn't be convenient for \r\norganisms that live in a cool environment, and so organisms regulate \r\nthe type of fat they synthesize according to the temperature of their \r\ntissues. The fact that certain types of polyunsaturated fatty acids \r\nfunction nicely in fish, worms, and insects, doesn't mean that they \r\nare ideal fats for mammals. The \r\nfact that vitamin E prevented or cured some of the major diseases in \r\nfarm animals caused by excessive PUFA, and that it could retard the \r\ndevelopment of rancidity in stored oils, led quickly to the persistent \r\nbelief that lipid peroxidation is the only toxic effect of the vegetable \r\noils. However, the oils were being seen to cause other problems, including \r\naccelerated aging and obesity, but those problems weren't of interest \r\nto farmers, who wanted to sell plump young animals as cheaply and quickly \r\nas possible. Even fresh oils have toxic effects, and the oxidative damage \r\nthey do is often the consequence of these other toxic actions. Another \r\ncheap food additive, coconut oil, was found to increase feed consumption \r\nwhile slowing weight gain, so it wasn't popular in the meat industry. \r\nThe highly unsaturated seed oils had the opposite effect, of producing \r\na rapid fattening of the animal, while decreasing feed consumption, \r\nso by 1950 corn and soybeans were widely considered to be optimal feeds \r\nfor maximizing profits in the production of meat animals. It was at \r\nthis time that the industry found that it could market the liquid oils \r\ndirectly to consumers, as health-promoting foods, without bothering \r\nto turn them into solid shortening or margarine. Somehow, few physiologists \r\ncontinued to think about the implications of metabolic slowing, obesity, \r\nand the related degenerative diseases. As \r\nvitamin research advanced in the 1940s, Roger Williams' lab at the Clayton \r\nFoundation Biochemical Institute, University of Texas at Austin, recognized \r\nthe \"fat deficiency disease\" of the Burrs as a deficiency \r\nof vitamin B6, and showed that when they produced the condition with \r\na diet similar to the one the Burrs had used, they could cure it by \r\nadministering vitamin B6. In the early 1930s George Burr had discovered \r\nthat animals on a fat free diet had an extremely high rate of metabolism, \r\nbut he didn't investigate the important ramifications of that observation, \r\nsuch as their increased need for vitamins and minerals, in accordance \r\nwith their rate of metabolism. The PUFA slowed metabolism, and that \r\neffect was good for agriculture. The \r\ncommercial pressure on fat research has created a new way of writing \r\nresearch reports, that several decades earlier wouldn't have been acceptable. \r\nFor example, the effects of a specific fat on a few of the components \r\nof a complex process such as clotting are often described in the title, \r\nintroduction, and conclusion of an article as if they were revealing \r\na way to prevent heart disease. The effects of unsaturated fats on cellsin vitroare often the opposite of their effects in living animals, \r\nbut editors are allowing authors to claim that theirin vitroresults justify dietary or therapeutic use of the fats. Journals of \r\nmedicine and nutrition are now preferred sites for commercial press \r\nreleases, composed to superficially resemble scientific reports. The \r\nsuppressive effects of unsaturated fats on mitochondrial energy production \r\nhave been widely investigated, since it is that effect that makes animal \r\nfattening with PUFA so economical. Rather than interpreting that as \r\na toxic effect, using the innate structure and function of the mitochondrion \r\nas a point of reference from which to evaluate dietary components, the \r\nconsumption of \"good\" oils is being used as the reference \r\npoint from which to evaluate the meaning of metabolism (\"efficiency \r\nis good,\" \"low oxygen consumption is good\"). Building \r\non the idea that the oils are health-promoters which increase metabolic \r\nefficiency, the never-viable \"rate of aging\" theory was resuscitated: \r\nThe anti-respiratory effect of PUFA is used (illogically) to return \r\nto the idea that aging occurs in proportion to the amount of oxygen \r\nconsumed, because animals which lack the supposedly essential nutrients \r\n(\"defective animals\") consume oxygen rapidly--burning calories \r\nrapidly, they are supposed to be like a candle that won't last as long \r\nif it burns intensely. The old theory is simply resuscitated to explain \r\nwhy the anti-respiratory action of PUFA might be beneficial, justifying \r\nfurther promotion of their use as food and drugs. Ordinarily, \r\nin biochemistry and physiology the inhibition of an enzyme is taken \r\nas a suggestion of toxicity, but when the point of reference is the \r\nidea of the goodness of PUFA, theactivityof an intrinsic enzyme \r\nis taken to be evidence of harm, and itsinhibition(by PUFA) \r\nis taken to be the proper, healthful situation. The enzyme that produces \r\nthe Mead fatty acid is strongly inhibited by PUFA seed oils (less strongly \r\nby fish oils), and so the presence of the Mead acid in the tissues is \r\ntaken as evidence that the animal is suffering damage resulting from \r\nthe absence of PUFA. The Mead acid happens to have some valuable anti-inflammatory \r\neffects, and is associated with many biological advantages, but research \r\nin that direction is prevented by the lack of funding. By \r\n1920, the polyunsaturated fatty acids were recognized to inhibit proteolytic \r\nenzymes. At that time, the production of unsaturated fat was considered \r\nto be a feature of certain pathogens, able to overcome the proteolytic-phagocytic \r\nfunctions of the immune system. Scattered \r\nstudies have found that polyunsaturated fats inhibit the proteolytic \r\nenzymes involved in the digestion of food, in the removal of clots, \r\nin the formation of thyroid hormone, and many other essential physiological \r\nprocesses. But currently, the only implication being drawn from this \r\nbroad class of effects of the PUFA is that some proteolytic enzymes \r\nare involved in disease processes, and consequently increased consumption \r\nof PUFA would be appropriate, because of their ability to suppress a \r\nconditionally harmful proteolytic enzyme. Since the organism consists \r\nmainly of proteins, there are complex innate systems for regulating \r\nthe proteolytic enzymes, activating or inactivating them as needed, \r\nand such complexity isn't likely to depend on variable, unstable dietary \r\nfactors. Exogenous substances that inhibit some proteases could create \r\nan unlimited variety of functional and anatomical irregularities. Some \r\nof the interesting enzymes affected specifically by polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids are those involved in hormone production. While they inhibit \r\nthe formation of progesterone and androgens, they activate the synthesis \r\nof estrogen, which in turn activates the release of more free polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids from the tissues, in a positive feedback pattern. The \r\ninhibition of detoxification enzymes by PUFA (Tsoutsikos, et al., 2004) \r\naffects many processes, such as the elimination of estrogen, contributing \r\nto the positive feedback between estrogen and the oils. The meaning \r\nof this tends to be lost, because of the estrogen industry's effective \r\ncampaigns. Another \r\nsituation in which fatty acids participate in a positive feedback system \r\nis the stress reaction, in which the released fatty acids impair mitochondrial \r\nenergy production, increasing the stress and leading to further release \r\nof fatty acids. One \r\nof the perennial theories of aging that has remained viable is the metaplasm/lipofuscin/age \r\npigment theory, the idea that a toxic material accumulates in tissues \r\nover time. The age pigment contains proteins, cross-linked PUFA, and \r\nmetals. The inhibition of proteolytic enzymes is involved in its accumulation, \r\nand the ratio of PUFA to saturated fatty acids is an important factor \r\nin its formation. Estrogen is one of the factors that can promote the \r\nformation of age pigment, probably partly because its lipolytic action \r\nincreases the cells' exposure to free fatty acids. The lipofuscin contributes \r\nto inhibition of proteolysis, probably partly through increased production \r\nof free radicals and hydrogen peroxide. The \r\nproteolytic enzymes are an essential part of innate immunity, and the \r\nhighly unsaturated fatty acid, EPA, which is the most immunosuppressive \r\nof the fats, strongly inhibits proteolysis in some cells. The natural \r\nkiller (NK) cells and phagocytic cells are two types of cell that are \r\nsuppressed by PUFA, and they are involved in many kinds of physiological \r\nevents, not just the killing of tumor cells and virus infected cells. The \r\nimmunosuppressive effects of PUFA are very general. Many metabolites \r\nthat are known to have harmful effects on the immune system are increased \r\nby the PUFA (histamine [Masini, et al., 1990], serotonin, lactate, nitric \r\noxide [Omura, et al., 2001]). These substances are also involved in \r\ntumor development. Besides \r\ninhibiting enzymes and being converted into prostaglandins, the polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids have direct effects, as signals (or interference with signals) \r\non many tissues. The belief that the PUFA are essential nutrients has \r\ninfluenced the way cellular excitability thresholds are being interpreted. \r\nAnxiety and panic may be interpreted as alertness, calmness may be interpreted \r\nas stupidity. Specifically, long-term potentiation (LTP) may contribute \r\nto seizures, senility, and excitotoxicity, as well as to learning, but \r\nmany titles and conclusions equate increased LTP with \"improved \r\nLTP,\" implying that it has biological value to the animal. The \r\nability of nerve cells to become quiescent after excitation is essential \r\nto learning and perception. This ability is lost with aging, as the \r\nfunctional balance in the brain shifts away from GABA-ergic to glutamatergic \r\nnerves. The polyunsaturated fatty acids promote the excitatory nervous \r\nstate. The combination of respiratory inhibition with excitation can \r\nproduce excitotoxic cell death. If the doctrine of \"essentiality \r\nof PUFA\" hadn't been so influential, different interpretations \r\nof excitatory thresholds, energy metabolism, and even cell structure \r\nwould have been allowed to develop more fully. The \r\nconcentration of polyunsaturated fats in the brain has led many people \r\nto say that the \"nutritionally essential fatty acids,\" especially \r\nthe omega -3 fatty acids, are essential for brain development (for the \r\nformation of nerve cell membranes), and for the formation of synapses, \r\nand that increasing the amount of those fats in the diet would be desirable. \r\nThe types of argument they use simply ignore the real evidence:Cells can multiply indefinitely in culture dishes without the essential \r\nfatty acids, insects can multiply for generations on diets without the \r\nunsaturated fats, forming normal synapses and brains, and mammals fed \r\ndiets with extremely small amounts of the unsaturated fats grow with \r\nperfectly normal--possibly superior--brains. One \r\nof the fats in the omega -9 series, that the human body can synthesize, \r\nnervonic acid, is a major constituent of brain tissue, but its important \r\nfunctions in brain development have hardly been investigated. Unlike \r\nthe unsaturated fatty acids oleic acid, linoleic acid, and eicosapentaenoic \r\nacid (EPA), nervonic acid isn't associated with the \"coronary risk \r\nfactors,\" and it has been suggested that it might be used in adults \r\nto prevent obesity-related diseases. (Oda, et al., 2005). One \r\nmajor area of research that has been neglected involves the role of \r\nfats in modifying the ways in which proteins and nucleic acids interact \r\nwith water--arguably the most basic of all physiological processes. \r\nUnsaturated fats are more water soluble than saturated fats, and they \r\nare involved in many problems of permeability and edema. In \r\naging and evolution, there are systematic changes in tissue water content \r\nthat appear to correspond to changes in rate of metabolism, to the degree \r\nof unsaturation of cellular fats, and to thyroid function and temperature. \r\nMetabolic intensity and longevity can be modified by changing the degree \r\nof saturation of fats in the diet and tissues, but--despite almost a \r\ncentury of sporadic investigations--no one has yet worked out in detail \r\nthe most appropriate way to do this. But it has become clear that the \r\n\"uncoupled\" mitochondrion, that \"wastes oxygen and calories,\" \r\n\r\nis protective against free radicals, cancer, and aging. Thyroid hormone \r\nand the absence of PUFA are important factors in supporting the \"wasteful\" \r\nmitochondrion. Although \r\nthe complex interactions of anatomy, energy, temperature, fat nutrition, \r\ntissue water content, and hormones haven't been systematically investigated, \r\nsome of the principles regarding the biological suitability of specific \r\nfats are already being applied in the limited context of therapy. At \r\npresent, the most important issue is to recognize the dangers presented \r\nby the intrusion of corporate power into science, especially as it relates \r\nto nutrition and medicine, and to consider the implications of the known \r\neffects of the PUFA on all of our biological systems. The \r\nfood-derived polyunsaturated fatty acids play important roles in the \r\ndevelopment of all of the problems associated with aging--reduced immunity, \r\ninsomnia, decreased learning ability, substitution of fat for muscle, \r\nsusceptibility to tissue peroxidation and inflammation, growth of tumors, \r\netc., and are probably involved in most other health problems, even \r\nin children. If research hadn't been guided by the economic interests \r\nof the seed oil industry, many of those problems would have been solved \r\nby now. The \r\ninfluence of the mass media on science can be seen in two issues that \r\nare currently well known. A \r\npopular test used for evaluating diabetes is the measurement of glycated \r\nhemoglobin, the attachment of a sugar-like fragment to the protein of \r\nhemoglobin. This is used to judge whether blood sugar is being controlled \r\nadequately. The glycation of proteins is widely believed to be a central \r\nprocess in aging, and is often used to argue that people should reduce \r\ntheir sugar consumption. Another \r\nwell publicized problem supposedly involving the reaction between sugars \r\nand proteins has to do with the discovery of the carcinogen, acrylamide, \r\nin breads and french fries. The Whole Foods Market was sued in California \r\nfor selling whole wheat bread without a warning that it contained a \r\ncarcinogen. But \r\nthe changes in proteins that occur in diabetes are mainly produced by \r\nthe breakdown products of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Acrylamide is \r\nproduced largely by the reaction of PUFA with proteins. Sugar, \r\nby reducing the level of free fatty acids in the body, actually tends \r\nto protect against these toxic effects of the PUFA. Diabetes, like cancer, \r\nhas been known for a long time to be promoted by unsaturated oils in \r\nthe diet, rather than by sugar. The seed oil industry has been more \r\neffective than the sugar industry in lobbying and advertising, and the \r\neffects can be seen in the assumptions that shape medical and biological \r\nresearch.

It's rare to see anything suggesting that it could be dangerous.During the recent years in which the U.S. government has gone from warning \r\nagainst the consumption of too much of these omega-3 oils(\"to assure that the combined daily intake of two fatty acids \r\nthat are components\" \"(i.e., eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and \r\ndocosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) would not exceed 3 grams per person per \r\nday (g/p/d)\")to sponsoring biased industry claims, there has \r\nbeen considerable accumulation of information about the dangers of fish \r\noils and omega-3 fatty acids. But there has been an even greater increase \r\nin the industry's promotional activities.The US government and the mass media selectively promote research that \r\nis favorable to the fish oil industry. The editorial boards of oil research \r\njournals often include industry representatives, and their editorial \r\ndecisions favor research conclusions that promote the industry, in the \r\nway that editorial decisions in previous decades favored articles that \r\ndenied the dangers of radiation and reported that estrogen cures almost \r\neverything. Marcia Angell, former editor of the NEJM, has observed that \r\nthe \"significant results\" reported in published studies can \r\nbe properly interpreted only by knowing how many studies reporting opposite \r\nresults were rejected by the editors.One way to evaluate published studies is to see whether they tell you \r\neverything you would need to know to replicate the experiment, and whether \r\nthe information they provide is adequate for drawing the conclusions \r\nthey draw, for example whether they compared the experimental subjects \r\nto proper control subjects. With just a few minimal critical principles \r\nof this sort, most \"scientific\" publications on nutrition, \r\nendocrinology, cancer and other degenerative diseases are seen to be \r\nunscientific. In nutritional experiments with fish oil, controls must \r\nreceive similar amounts of vitamins A, D, E, and K, and should include \r\nfat free or \"EFA\" deficient diets for comparison.In declaring EPA and DHA to be safe, the FDA neglected to evaluate their \r\nantithyroid, immunosuppressive, lipid peroxidative (Song et al., 2000), \r\nlight sensitizing, and antimitochondrial effects, their depression of \r\nglucose oxidation (Delarue et al., 2003), and their contribution to \r\nmetastatic cancer (Klieveri, et al., 2000), lipofuscinosis and liver \r\ndamage, among other problems.========================================= \"Houston-based \r\nOmega Protein Inc.'s bottom line may get a little fatter.The publicly traded company, which produces an Omega-3 fatty acid product \r\ncalled OmegaPure, has signed an agreement to provide its fish oil in \r\nschool lunches in 38 school districts in South Texas beginning this \r\nmonth.The 500-person company, which has ties to former President George Bush's \r\nZapata Corp., will distribute the product through an agreement with \r\nMercedes-based H&H Foods.Although the dollar amount of the contract between Omega Protein and \r\nH&H Foods hinges on future sales, the company is poised to cash \r\nin as school administrators and parents refocus their attention on the \r\nnutritional content of student diets.Omega Protein President and CEO Joseph von Rosenberg says the company's \r\nrecent investment of $16.5 million for a fish oil refinery in Reedville, \r\nVa., scheduled for completion in May, and an increased awareness of \r\nthe benefits of Omega-3 in human food, positions Omega to capitalize \r\non predicted demand.\"Jenna ColleyHouston Business Journal =========================================Andrew Weil was on the radio recently recommending DHA (usually found \r\nin fish oil*) to treat depression, and I think that means that a lot \r\nof people are buying it and eating it. A few years ago the government \r\ndeclared that it was \"generally regarded as safe\" and approved \r\nits use in baby formula, and a few months ago Texas school districts \r\ncontracted with Omega Protein (which grew out of the Bush family's Zapata \r\nCorporation) to provide menhaden fish oil for school lunches. Between \r\nthe 1950s and the 1970s, people were assured that eating polyunsaturated \r\nseed oils would protect them against heart disease. There's no evidence \r\nthat the bad outcome of that campaign decreased the gullibility of the \r\npublic. They are happily joining in the latest public health experiment. *Weil recommends eating \"oily fish\"--\"wild Alaskan \r\nsalmon, mackerel, sardines, or herring\"--. \"If you do take \r\nsupplements, fish oil is a better source of DHA than algae\"When a group of people in government and industry decide on a policy, \r\nthey can use carrots (good jobs, grants, and prestige) and sticks (loss \r\nof jobs and grants, organized slander, and worse) to make their guidelines \r\nclear, and most people will choose to follow those cues, even if they \r\nknow that the policy is wrong. Historically, policy makers have told \r\nthe public that \"radiation is good for you,\" \"estrogen \r\nwill make you fertile (or safely infertile) and feminine and strong \r\nand intelligent,\" \"starchy foods will prevent diabetes and \r\nobesity,\" \"using diuretics and avoiding salt will make pregnancy \r\nsafer,\" and that the polyunsaturated fatty acids are \"nutritionally \r\nessential, and will prevent heart disease.\"The original \"essential fatty acids\" were linoleic, \r\nlinolenic, and arachidonic acids. Now that the toxic effects of those \r\nare coming to be recognized, new \"essential fatty acids,\" \r\nthe omega-3 fatty acids, including those with long chains, found in \r\nfish oils, are said to make babies more intelligent, to be necessary \r\nfor good vision, and to prevent cancer, heart disease, obesity, arthritis, \r\ndepression, epilepsy, psychosis, dementia, ulcers, eczema and dry skin.With just a normal amount of vitamin E in the diet, cod liver oil is \r\ncertain to be highly oxidized in the tissues of a mammal that eats a \r\nlot of it, and an experiment with dogs showed that it could increase \r\ntheir cancer mortality from the normal 5% to 100%. Although fish oils \r\nrapidly destroy vitamin E in the body, some of them, especially the \r\nliver oils, can provide useful vitamins, A and D. In studies comparing \r\nfish oil diets with standard diets, these nutrients, as well as any \r\ntoxins besides fatty acids (Huang, et al., 1997; Miyazaki, et al., 1998) \r\nin either type of oil, should be taken into account, but they seldom \r\nare. Despite the nutritional value of those vitamins, fish oils are generally \r\nmuch more immunosuppressive than the seed oils, and the early effects \r\nof fish oil on the \"immune system\" include the suppression \r\nof prostaglandin synthesis, because the more highly unsaturated long \r\nchain fats interfere with the conversion of linoleic acid into arachidonic \r\nacid and prostaglandins. The prostaglandins are so problematic that \r\ntheir suppression is helpful, whether the inhibition is caused by aspirin \r\nor vitamin E, or by fish oil. Some of the important antiinflammatory effects of fish oil result from \r\nthe oxidized oils, rather than the unchanged oils (Sethi, 2002; Chaudhary, \r\net al., 2004). These oils are so unstable that they begin to spontaneously \r\noxidize even before they reach the bloodstream. In experiments that last just a few weeks or months, there may not be \r\ntime for cancers to develop, and on that time scale, the immunosuppressive \r\nand antiinflammatory effects of oxidized fish oil might seem beneficial. \r\nFor a few decades, x-ray treatments were used to relieve inflammatory \r\nconditions, and most of the doctors who promoted the treatment were \r\nable to retire before their patients began suffering the fatal effects \r\nof atrophy, fibrosis, and cancer. (But a few people are still advocating \r\nx-ray therapy for inflammatory diseases, e.g., Hildebrandt, et al., \r\n2003.) The fish oil fad is now just as old as the x-ray fad was at its \r\npeak of popularity, and if its antiinflammatory actions involve the \r\nsame mechanisms as the antiinflammatory immunosuppressive x-ray treatments, \r\nthen we can expect to see another epidemic of fibrotic conditions and \r\ncancer in about 15 to 20 years.Around 1970 researchers reported that animals given fish oil in their \r\nfood lived longer than animals on the standard diet. Alex Comfort, who \r\nwas familiar with the research showing that simple reduction of food \r\nintake increased longevity, observed that the animals were very reluctant \r\nto eat the food containing smelly fish oil, and were eating so little \r\nfood that their longevity could be accounted for by their reduced caloric \r\nintake. Even when \"fresh\" deodorized fish oil is added to \r\nthe diet, its spontaneous oxidation before it reaches the animal's tissues \r\nreduces its caloric value. Without antioxidants, fish oil is massively \r\ndegraded within 48 hours, and even with a huge amount of antioxidant \r\nthere is still considerable degradation (Gonzalez, 1988; Klein, et al., \r\n1990).Fish oil has been used for hundreds of years as varnish or for fuel \r\nin lamps, and the fatty fish have been used as fertilizer and animal \r\nfeed, and later the hydrogenated solid form of the oil, which is more \r\nstable, has been used in Europe as a food substitute for people. When \r\nwhale hunting was reduced around 1950, fish oil was substituted for \r\nwhale oil in margarine production. Like the seed oils, such as linseed \r\noil, the fish oils were mostly replaced by petroleum derivatives in \r\nthe paint industry after the 1960s. Although by 1980 many animal diseases were known to be caused by eating \r\noily fish, and the unsaturated oils were known to accelerate the formation \r\nof the \"age pigment,\" lipofuscin, many \"beneficial effects\" \r\nof dietary fish oil started appearing in research journals around that \r\ntime, and the mass media, responding to the industry's public relations \r\ncampaign, began ignoring studies that showed harmful effects from eating \r\nfish oil. When reviewers in professional journals begin to ignore valid research \r\nwhose conclusions are harmful to the fish oil industry, we can see that \r\nthe policy guidelines set by the industry and its agents in government \r\nhave become clear. Around the end of the century, we begin to see a \r\nstrange literary device appearing, in which research reports on the \r\ntoxic effects of omega-3 oils are prefaced by remarks to the effect \r\nthat \"we all know how great these oils are for good health.\" \r\nI think I detect groveling and shuffling of the feet by authors who \r\nwant to get their work published. If you are willing to say that your \r\nwork probably doesn't mean what it seems to mean, maybe they will publish \r\nit. For more than 50 years, the great majority of the medical publications \r\non estrogen were part of the drug industry's campaign to fraudulently \r\ngain billions of dollars, and anyone who cared to analyze them could \r\nsee that the authors and editors were part of a cult, rather than seekers \r\nof useful knowledge. Likewise, the doctrine of the harmlessness of x-rays \r\nand radioactive fallout was kept alive for several decades by demonizing \r\nall who challenged it. It now looks as though we are in danger of entering \r\nanother period of medical-industrial-governmental cultism, this time \r\nto promote the universal use of polyunsaturated fats as both drugs and \r\nfoods.In 2004, a study of 29,133 men reported that the use of omega-3 oil \r\nor consumption of fish didn't decrease depression or suicide, and in \r\n2001, a study of 42,612 men and women reported that after more than \r\n9 years the use of cod liver oil showed no protective effect against \r\ncoronary heart disease (Hakkarainen, et al., 2004; Egeland, et al., \r\n2001). The most popular way of arguing that fish oil will prevent heart disease \r\nis to show that it lowers blood lipids, continuing the old approach \r\nof the American Heart Association's \"heart protective diet.\" \r\nUnfortunately for that argument, it's now known that the triglycerides \r\nin the blood are decreased because of the fish oil's toxic effects on \r\nthe liver (Hagve and Christophersen, 1988; Ritskes-Hoitinga, et al., \r\n1998). In experiments with rats, EPA and DHA lowered blood lipids only \r\nwhen given to rats that had been fed, in which case the fats were incorporated \r\ninto tissues, and suppressed mitochondrial respiration (Osmundsen, et \r\nal., 1998). The belief that eating cholesterol causes heart disease was based mainly \r\non old experiments with rabbits, and subsequent experiments have made \r\nit clear that it isoxidizedcholesterol that damages \r\nthe arteries (Stapran, et al., 1997). Since both fish oil and oxidized \r\ncholesterol damage rabbits' arteries, and since the lipid peroxides \r\nassociated with fish oil attack a great variety of biological materials, \r\nincluding the LDL lipoproteins carrying cholesterol, the implications of \r\nthe rabbit experiments now seem very different. Another way of arguing for the use of fish oil or other omega-3 fats \r\nis to show a correlation between disease and a decreased amount of EPA, \r\nDHA, or arachidonic acid in the tissues, and to say \"these oils \r\nare deficient, the disease is caused by a deficiency of essential fatty \r\nacids.\" Those oils are extremely susceptible to oxidation, so they \r\ntend to spontaneously disappear in response to tissue injury, cellular \r\nexcitation, the increased energy demands of stress, exposure to toxins \r\nor ionizing radiation, or even exposure to light. That spontaneous oxidation \r\nis what made them useful as varnish or paint medium. But it is what \r\nmakes them sensitize the tissues to injury. Their \"deficiency\" \r\n\r\nin the tissues frequently corresponds to the intensity of oxidative \r\nstress and lipid peroxidation; it is usually their presence, rather \r\nthan their deficiency, that created the disposition for the disease. One of the earliest harmful effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids, \r\nPUFA, to be observed was their acceleration of the formation of lipofuscin \r\nor ceroid, the \"age pigment,\" during oxidative stress or vitamin \r\nE deficiency. Associated with the formation of lipofuscin, the PUFA \r\nwere discovered to cause degeneration of the gonads and brain, and the \r\nfact that vitamin E could prevent some of their toxic effects led to \r\nthe idea that vitamin E was essentially an antioxidant. Unfortunately, \r\nthe protective effect of vitamin E against the PUFA is only partial \r\n(Allard, et al., 1997). The degenerative diseases are all associated with disturbances involving \r\nfat metabolism and lipid peroxidation. Alzheimer's disease, alcoholic \r\nand nonalcoholic liver disease, retinal degeneration, epilepsy, AIDS, \r\ndiabetes, and a variety of circulatory problems involve breakdown products \r\nof the PUFA. The products of PUFA decomposition include acrolein, malondialdehyde, \r\nhydroxynonenal, crotonaldehyde, ethane, pentane, and the neuroprostanes, \r\nwhich are prostaglandin-like molecules formed from DHA by free radical \r\nlipid peroxidation products, especially in the brain and at a higher \r\nlevel in Alzheimer's disease. The reactions of three types of cell--vascular endothelium, nerve cells, \r\nand thymus cells--to the PUFA will illustrate some of the important \r\nprocesses involved in their toxicity. When the body doesn't have enough glucose, free fatty acids are released \r\nfrom the tissues, and their oxidation blocks the oxidation of glucose \r\neven when it becomes available from the breakdown of protein caused \r\nby cortisol, which is released during glucose deprivation. Cells of \r\nthe thymus are sensitive to glucose deprivation, and even in the presence \r\nof glucose, cortisol prevents them from using glucose, causing them \r\nto take up fatty acids. The thymic cells die easily when exposed either \r\nto excess cortisol, or deficient glucose. The polyunsaturated fatty \r\nacidslinoleate, arachidonate, and eicosapentaenoic, are especially \r\ntoxic to thymic cells by preventing their inactivation of cortisol, \r\nincreasing its action. (Klein, et al., 1987, 1989, 1990). Lymphocytes \r\nfrom people with AIDS and leukemia are less able to metabolize cortisol. \r\nAn extract of serum from AIDS patients caused lymphocytes exposed to \r\ncortisol to die 7 times faster than cells from healthy people. AIDS \r\npatients have high levels of both cortisol and free polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids (Christeff, et al., 1988).The cytotoxicity caused by EPA and its metabolites (15 mg. of EPA per \r\nliter killed over 90% of a certain type of macrophage) isn't inhibited \r\nby vitamin E (Fyfe and Abbey, 2000). Immunological activation tends \r\nto kill T cells that contain PUFA (Switzer, et al., 2003). When animals are fed fish oil and then exposed to bacteria, their immunosuppressed \r\nthymic (T) cells cause them to succumb to the infection more easily \r\nthan animals fed coconut oil or a fat free diet. Natural killer cells, \r\nwhich eliminate cancer cells and virus infected cells, are decreased \r\nafter eating fish oil, and T suppressor cells are often increased. More \r\nsubtle interference with immunity is produced by the actions of PUFA \r\non the \"immune synapse,\" a contact between cells that permits \r\nthe transmission of immunological information. The immunosuppressive \r\neffect of fish oil is recognized as a useful aid in preventing the rejection \r\nof transplanted organs, but some studies are showing that survival a \r\nyear after transplantation isn't improved. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially those that can be turned into \r\nprostaglandins, are widely involved in causing inflammation and vascular \r\nleakiness. EPA and DHA don't form ordinary prostaglandins, though the \r\nisoprostanes and neuroprostanes they produce during lipid peroxidation \r\nbehave in many ways like the more common prostaglandins, and their enzymically \r\nformed eicosanoids have some functions similar to those of the common \r\nprostaglandins. The brain contains a very high concentration of these \r\nunstable fatty acids, and they are released in synapses by ordinary \r\nexcitatory process. Chan, et al., 1983, found that polyunsaturated fats caused brain swelling \r\nand increased blood vessel permeability. In 1988, Chan's group found \r\nthat DHA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids added to cultured cells \r\nfrom the cerebral cortex produced free radicals and stimulated production \r\nof malondialdehyde and lactate, and inhibited the uptake of glutamic \r\nacid, which suggests that they would contribute to prolonged excitation \r\nof the nerves (Yu, et al., 1986). In brain slices, the polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids caused the production of free radicals and swelling of the \r\ntissue, and the saturated fatty acids didn't (Chan and Fishman, 1980). \r\nThe PUFA inhibited the respiration of mitochondria in brain cells (Hillered \r\nand Chan, 1988), and at a higher concentration, caused them to swell \r\n(Hillered and Chan, 1989), but saturated fatty acids didn't produce \r\nedema. Free radical activity was shown to cause the liberation of free \r\nfatty acids from the cellular structure (Chan, et al., 1982, 1984). \r\nThe activation of lipases by free radicals and lipid peroxides, with \r\nthe loss of potassium from the cells, suggests that excitation can become \r\na self-stimulating process, leading to cellular destruction. DHA itself, rather than its decomposition products, facilitates excitatory \r\n(glutamate) nerve transmission (Nishikawa, et al., 1994), and that excitatory \r\naction causes the release of arachidonic acid (Pellerin and Wolfe, 1991). Considering just one of the products of fish oil peroxidation, acrolein, \r\nand a few of its effects in cells, we can get an idea of the types of \r\ndamage that could result from increasing the amount of omega-3 fats \r\nin our tissues.The \"barrier\" between the brain and blood stream is one of \r\nthe most effective vascular barriers in the body, but it is very permeable \r\nto oils, and lipid peroxidation disrupts it, damaging the ATPase that \r\nregulates sodium and potassium (Stanimirovic, et al., 1995). Apparently, \r\nanything that depletes the cell's energy, lowering ATP, allows an excess \r\nof calcium to enter cells, contributing to their death (Ray, et al., \r\n1994). Increasing intracellular calcium activates phospholipases, releasing \r\nmore polyunsaturated fats (Sweetman, et al., 1995) The acrolein which \r\nis released during lipid peroxidation inhibits mitochondrial function \r\nby poisoning the crucial respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase, resulting \r\nin a decreased ability to produce energy (Picklo and Montine, 2001). \r\n(In the retina, the PUFA contribute to light-induced damage of the energy \r\nproducing ability of the cells [King, 2004], by damaging the same crucial \r\nenzyme.) Besides inhibiting the ability of nerve cells to produce energy \r\nfrom the oxidation of glucose, acrolein inhibits the ability of cells \r\nto regulate the excitatory amino acid glutamate (Lovell, et al., 2000), \r\ncontributing to the excitatory process. High levels of acrolein (and \r\nother products of PUFA degradation) are found in the brain in Alzheimer's \r\ndisease (Lovell, et al., 2001). The \"prion\" diseases, CJD and TSE/BSE (mad cow disease) have \r\nmany features in common with Alzheimer's disease, and several studies \r\nhave shown that the \"prion\" protein produces its damage by \r\nactivating the lipases that release polyunsaturated fatty acids and \r\nproduce lipid peroxides (Bate, et al., 2004, Stewart, et al., 2001).Acrolein reacts with DNA, causing \"genetic\" damage, and also \r\nreacts with the lysine in proteins, for example contributing to the \r\ntoxicity of oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDL), the proteins that \r\ncarry cholesterol and that became famous because of their involvement \r\nin the development of atherosclerosis that was supposedly caused by \r\neating saturated fats. My newsletter on mad cow disease discussed the evidence incriminating \r\nthe use of fish meal in animal feed, as a cause of the degenerative \r\nbrain diseases, and earlier newsletters (glycemia, and glycation) discussed \r\nthe reasons for thinking that inappropriate glycation of lysine groups \r\nin proteins, as a result of a lack of protective carbon dioxide/carbamino \r\ngroups, produces the amyloid (or \"prion\") proteins that characterize \r\nthe dementias. Acrolein, produced from the decomposing \"fish oils\" \r\nin the brain, is probably the most reactive product of lipid peroxidation \r\nin the brain, and so would be likely to cause the glycation of lysine \r\nin the plaque-forming proteins.These toxic effects of acrolein in the brain are analogous to the multitude \r\nof toxic effects of the omega-3 fatty acids and their breakdown products \r\nin all of the other organs and tissues of the body. Cancer cells are \r\nunusual in their degree of resistance to the lethal actions of the lipid \r\nperoxides, but the inflammatory effects of the highly unsaturated fatty \r\nacids are now widely recognized to be essentially involved in the process \r\nof cancerization (my newsletters on cancer and leakiness discuss some \r\nof the ways the fats are involved in tumor development).The fats that we synthesize from sugar, or coconut oil, or oleic acid, \r\nthe omega-9 series, are protective against the inflammatory PUFA, in \r\nsome cases more effective even than vitamin E. In Woody Allen's 1973 movie,Sleeper,the protagonist \r\nwoke up after being frozen for 200 years, to find that saturated fats \r\nwere health foods.  At the time the movie was made, that had already \r\nbeen established (e.g., Hartroft and Porta, 1968 edition ofPresent \r\nKnowledge in Nutrition, who showed that adequate saturated fat in \r\nthe diet helped to protect against the formation of lipofuscin).PS:Royal Society for the Protection of Birds says 2004 has been the most \r\ncatastrophic breeding season on record for seabirds along UK coasts. \r\nIt says industrial fishing to supply fish meal and oil is barely sustainable \r\nand imperils the whole marine food web.\"The UK has suffered serious seabird disasters this year already. \r\nIn Shetland and Orkney, entire colonies of birds failed to produce any \r\nyoung because of severe food shortages. \"On top of that, hundreds \r\nof seabirds have been washing ashore having perished at sea. Again, \r\nlack of food is thought to be one of the reasons.\" The report, \r\nAssessment Of The Sustainability Of Industrial Fisheries Producing Fish \r\nMeal And Fish Oil, was compiled for the RSPB by Poseidon Aquatic Resource \r\nManagement Ltd and the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.REFERENCESNeuroreport. 2002 Oct 28;13(15):1933-8.Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors \r\nprotect against prion-induced neurotoxicity in vitro.Bate C, Rutherford \r\nS, Gravenor M, Reid S, Williams A.Neuroreport. 2004 Mar 1;15(3):509-13.The role of platelet activating \r\nfactor in prion and amyloid-beta neurotoxicity.Bate C, Salmona \r\nM, Williams A.J Biol Chem. 2004 Aug 27;279(35):36405-11.Phospholipase A2 inhibitors \r\nor platelet-activating factor antagonists prevent prion replication.Bate C, Reid S, Williams A.J Neurochem  1980 Oct;35(4):1004-7.Transient formation of superoxide \r\nradicals in polyunsaturated fatty acid-induced brain swelling.Chan \r\nPH, Fishman RA.Brain Res. 1982 Sep 23;248(1):151-7.Alterations of membrane integrity \r\nand cellular constituents by arachidonic acid in neuroblastoma and glioma \r\ncells.Chan PH, Fishman RA.J Neurochem. 1982 Feb;38(2):525-31.Phospholipid degradation and \r\ncellular edema induced by free radicals in brain cortical slices.Chan PH, Yurko M, Fishman RA.Ann Neurol. 1983 Jun;13(6):625-32.Induction of brain edema following \r\nintracerebral injection of arachidonic acid.Chan PH, Fishman RA, \r\nCaronna J, Schmidley JW, Prioleau G, Lee J.J Neurosci Res. 1984;12(4):595-605.Release of polyunsaturated fatty \r\nacids from phospholipids and alteration of brain membrane integrity \r\nby oxygen-derived free radicals.Chan PH, Fishman RA, Schmidley \r\nJW, Chen SF.

Transmissible spongiform \r\nencephalopathies (TSEs) are transmissible neurodegenerative diseases \r\ncharacterized by the accumulation of an abnormally folded prion protein, \r\ntermed PrPSc, and the development of pathological features of astrogliosis, \r\nvacuolation, neuronal cell loss, and in some cases amyloid plaques. \r\nAlthough considerable structural characterization of prion protein has \r\nbeen reported, neither the method of conversion of cellular prion protein, \r\nPrPC, into the pathogenic isoform nor the post-translational modification \r\nprocesses involved is known. We report that in animal and humanTSEs, \r\none or more lysines at residues 23, 24, and 27 of PrPSc are covalently \r\nmodified with advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs),which \r\nmay be carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), one of the structural varieties of \r\nAGEs. The arginine residue at position 37 may also be modified with \r\nAGE, but not the arginine residue at position 25. This result suggests \r\nthat nonenzymatic glycation is one of the post-translational modifications \r\nof PrP(Sc). Furthermore, immunostaining studies indicate that, at least \r\nin clinically affected hamsters, astrocytes are the first site of this \r\nglycation process.Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol 1988 Jul;24(7):1179-83.Abnormal free fatty \r\nacids and cortisol concentrations in the serum of AIDS patients.Christeff N, Michon C, Goertz G, Hassid J, Matheron S, Girard PM, Coulaud \r\nJP, Nunez EALipids. 1996 Aug;31(8):829-37.Effect of dietary n-9 eicosatrienoic \r\nacid on the fatty acid composition of plasma lipid fractions and tissue \r\nphospholipids.Cleland LG, Neumann MA, Gibson RA, Hamazaki T, Akimoto \r\nK, James MJ.J Nutr. 1996 Jun;126(6):1534-40.Dietary (n-9) eicosatrienoic acid \r\nfrom a cultured fungus inhibits leukotriene B4 synthesis in rats and \r\nthe effect is modified by dietary linoleic acid.Cleland LG, Gibson \r\nRA, Neumann MA, Hamazaki T, Akimoto K, James MJ.Br J Nutr. 2003 Oct;90(4):777-86.

        "chunk_html": "Gelatin, stress, longevity============================ The \r\nmain bulk of an animal's body consists of water, protein, fat and bones. \r\nFat tissue and bone are metabolically more quiescent than the protein-water \r\nsystems. During stress or starvation, or even hibernation, animals lose \r\nlean mass faster than fat. The \r\namino acids that constitute protein have many hormone-like functions \r\nin their free state. When our glucose (glycogen) stores have been depleted, \r\nwe convert our own tissue into free amino acids, some of which are used \r\nto produce new glucose. The amino acids cysteine and tryptophan, released \r\nin large quantities during stress, have antimetabolic (thyroid-suppressing) \r\nand, eventually, toxic effects. Hypothyroidism itself increases the \r\ncatabolic turnover of protein, even though general metabolism is slowed. Other \r\namino acids act as nerve-modifiers (transmitters), causing, for \r\nexample, excitation or inhibition. Some \r\nof these amino acids, such as glycine, have a very broad range of cell-protective \r\nactions. Their \r\nphysical properties, rather than their use for production of energy \r\nor other metabolic function, are responsible for their important cytoprotective \r\nactions. Gelatin \r\n(the cooked form of collagen) makes up about 50% of the protein in an \r\nanimal, but a much smaller percentage in the more active tissues, such \r\nas brain, muscle, and liver. 35% of the amino acids in gelatin are glycine, \r\n11% alanine, and 21% proline and hydroxyproline. In \r\nthe industrialized societies, the consumption of gelatin has decreased, \r\nrelative to the foods that contain an inappropriately high proportion \r\nof the antimetabolic amino acids, especially tryptophan and cysteine. The \r\ndegenerative and inflammatory diseases can often be corrected by the \r\nuse of gelatin-rich foods. ============================ I \r\nusually think about something for a long time before I get around to \r\nintegrating it into my life, sometimes because old habits have to be \r\nchanged, but usually because our social organization is set up to do \r\nthings in conventional ways. Our foods reflect our social organization, \r\nenforced by laws and rules. When I first went to Mexico to study, many \r\ntraditional foods were still available even in the city--fried pig skin, \r\nserved crisp or boiled with a sauce, blood tacos, cartilaginous parts \r\nof various animals, chicken-foot soup, crustaceans, insects, etc. Later, \r\nwhen I studied biochemistry, I realized that each part of an organism \r\nhas a characteristic chemistry and special nutritional value. I knew \r\nof Weston Price's research on traditional diets, and his argument that \r\nthe degenerative diseases of civilization were produced by the \r\nsimplified diets that are characteristic of the highly industrialized \r\nsocieties. As \r\nI began to study endocrinology, I realized that there were some radical \r\nmisconceptions behind the ideas of scientific nutrition. I. P. \r\nPavlov, who had studied nutritional physiology because it constituted \r\nthe animal's closest interactions with its environment, was motivated \r\nby a desire to understand life in its totality, including consciousness. \r\nBut western nutritionists were nearly all committed to an ideology that \r\nforced them to think in terms of essential factors for growth, \r\nleading to ideas such as minimum daily requirement for each nutrient. \r\nBodily bulk (especially body length) was the criterion, not the experienced \r\nquality of life. And there has been no scarcity of evidence showing \r\nthat rapid bodily growth has its drawbacks (e.g., Miller, et al., 2002, \r\nBig mice die young). One \r\nof the brightest of the genetically oriented nutritionists, Roger Williams, \r\nused the idea of genetic individuality to explain that the popular idea \r\nof a species-wide standard diet couldn't be applied to exceptional individuals, \r\nand that disease was often the result of the mismatch between special \r\nnutritional requirements and a standard diet. Linus Pauling's \r\nconcept of orthomolecular medicine was a restatement of Williams' principle \r\nfor the general scientific community. But still, the emphasis was on the match between a specific chemical \r\nand thegenetic constitutionof the organism. Pavlov's \r\nidea of the trophic actions of nerves was discarded, and the rest \r\nof his work was relegated to a crudely caricatured branch of psychology. \r\nHis therapeutic recommendation of beef broth for many ailments was ignored \r\nas having nothing to do with the caricatured Pavlovism. If \r\nnerves are intimately involved in the processes of nutrition and development, \r\nthe effects of nutrients on the nerves and their development should \r\nhave a central place in nutritional research. Our appetites reflect \r\nour biochemical needs, and our unconditional reflexes are likely \r\nto be wiser than the theories that are based simply on the amount of \r\nweight a young animal gains on a particular diet. When \r\nI began teaching endocrinology, some of my students didn't want to hear \r\nabout anything except lock and key endocrinology, in which a \r\nhormone signals certain cells that have a suitable receptor for that \r\nhormone. But the studies of Hans Selye and Albert Szent-Gyorgyi made \r\nit clear that Pavlov's global, holistic approach to the organism in \r\nits environment was the soundest scientific basis for physiology, including \r\nendocrinology. A cell's response to a hormone depended on the state \r\nof the cell. Nutrients and metabolites and hormones and neurotransmitters \r\nall modify the cell's sensitivity to its surroundings. The assumptions \r\nof molecular biology, as generally understood, are fundamentally \r\nmistaken. The \r\nidea of fixed requirements for specific nutrients, and especially the \r\nidea that rapid physical growth was the way to determine the essentiality \r\nof a substance, led to a monstrous distortion of the official dietary \r\nrecommendations. Business, industry, government, and the health professions \r\ncollaborated in the propagation of an ideology about nutrition that \r\nmisrepresented the nature of the living organism. Most \r\nstudies of the nutritional requirements for protein have been done for \r\nthe agricultural industries, and so have been designed to find the cheapest \r\nway to get the maximum growth in the shortest time. The industry isn't \r\ninterested in the longevity, intelligence, or happiness of their pigs, \r\nchickens, and lambs. The industry has used chemical growth stimulants \r\nin combination with the foods that support rapid growth at least expense. \r\nAntibiotics and arsenic and polyunsaturated fatty acids have become \r\npart of our national food supply because they produce rapid weight gain \r\nin young animals. The \r\namino acids in proteins have been defined as essential on the \r\nbasis of their contribution to growth, ignoring their role in producing \r\nlong life, good brain development, and good health. The amino acid and \r\nprotein requirements during aging have hardly been studied, except in \r\nrats, whose short life-span makes such studies fairly easy. The few \r\nstudies that have been done indicate that the requirements for tryptophan \r\nand cysteine become very low in adulthood. Although \r\nClive McKay's studies of life extension through caloric restriction \r\nwere done in the 1930s, only a few studies have been done to find out \r\nwhich nutrients' restriction contributes most to extending the life \r\nspan. Restricting toxic heavy metals, without restricting calories, \r\nproduces about the same life-extending effect as caloric restriction.Restricting only tryptophan, or only cysteine, produces a greater extension \r\nof the life span than achieved in most of the studies of caloric restriction.How great would be the life-span extension if both tryptophan and cysteine \r\nwere restricted at the same time? Both \r\ntryptophan and cysteine inhibit thyroid function and mitochondrial energy \r\nproduction, and have other effects that decrease the ability to withstand \r\nstress. Tryptophan is the precursor to serotonin, which causes inflammation, \r\nimmunodepression, and generally the same changes seen in aging. Histidine \r\nis another amino acid precursor to a mediator of inflammation, histamine;would the restriction of histidine in the diet have a longevity promoting \r\neffect, too? It \r\nhappens that gelatin is a protein which contains no tryptophan, and \r\nonly small amounts of cysteine, methionine, and histidine. Using gelatin \r\nas a major dietary protein is an easy way to restrict the amino acids \r\nthat are associated with many of the problems of aging. The \r\nmain amino acids in gelatin are glycine and proline;alanine is also present in significant quantity. Glycine and proline \r\nare responsible for the unusual fibrous property of collagen. An \r\nanimal's body, apart from fat and water, is mostly protein, and about \r\nhalf of the protein in the body is collagen (which is the native, uncooked \r\nform of gelatin). Its name is derived from its traditional use as glue. \r\nIt is responsible for the structural toughness of mature animal bodies. When \r\ncells are stressed, they form extra collagen, but they can also dissolve \r\nit, to allow for tissue remodeling and growth. Invasive cancers over-produce \r\nthis kind of enzyme, destroying the extracellular matrix which is needed \r\nfor normal cellular differentiation and function. When collagen is broken \r\ndown, it releases factors that promote wound healing and suppress tumor \r\ninvasiveness. (Pasco, et al., 2003) Glycine itself is one of the factors \r\npromoting wound healing and tumor inhibition. It \r\nhas a wide range of antitumor actions, including the inhibition of new \r\nblood vessel formation (angiogenesis), and it has shown protective activity \r\nin liver cancer and melanoma. Since glycine is non-toxic (if the kidneys \r\nare working, since any amino acid will contribute to the production \r\nof ammonia), this kind of chemotherapy can be pleasant. When \r\nwe eat animal proteins in the traditional ways (for example, eating \r\nfish head soup, as well as the muscles, or head-cheese as well \r\nas pork chops, and chicken-foot soup as well as drumsticks), we assimilate \r\na large amount of glycine and gelatin. This whole-animal balance of \r\namino acids supports all sorts of biological process, including a balanced \r\ngrowth of children's tissues and organs. When \r\nonly the muscle meats are eaten, the amino acid balance entering our \r\nblood stream is the same as that produced by extreme stress, when cortisol \r\nexcess causes our muscles to be broken down to provide energy and material \r\nfor repair. The formation of serotonin is increased by the excess tryptophan \r\nin muscle, and serotonin stimulates the formation of more cortisol, \r\nwhile the tryptophan itself, along with the excess muscle-derived cysteine, \r\nsuppresses the thyroid function. A \r\ngenerous supply of glycine/gelatin, against a balanced background of \r\namino acids, has a great variety of antistress actions. Glycine is recognized \r\nas an inhibitory neurotransmitter, and promotes natural sleep. \r\nUsed as a supplement, it has helped to promote recovery from strokes \r\nand seizures, and to improve learning and memory. But in every type \r\nof cell, it apparently has the same kind of quieting, protective antistress \r\naction. The range of injuries produced by an excess of tryptophan and \r\nserotonin seems to be prevented or corrected by a generous supply of \r\nglycine. Fibrosis, free radical damage, inflammation, cell death from \r\nATP depletion or calcium overload, mitochondrial damage, diabetes, etc., \r\ncan be prevented or alleviated by glycine. Some \r\ntypes of cell damage are prevented almost as well by alanine and proline \r\nas by glycine, so the use of gelatin, rather than glycine, is preferable, \r\nespecially when the gelatin is associated with its normal biochemicals. \r\nFor example, skin is a rich source of steroid hormones, and cartilage \r\ncontains Mead acid, which is itself antiinflammatory. The \r\nother well-studied inhibitory neurotransmitter is GABA, so it's significant \r\nthat GABA (gamma amino butyric acid) is a close analog of glycine (alpha \r\namino acetic acid). A synthetic molecule structurally similar to those \r\nnatural inhibitory transmitters, beta amino propanoic acid, has \r\nsome of the protective effects of glycine and GABA. The other molecules \r\nin the series, at least up to epsilon amino caproic acid, have some \r\nof the same antiinvasive, antiinflammatory, anti-angiogenic, properties. \r\nAlanine and proline, with cell-protecting actions, have the same basic \r\ncomposition, carbon (CH2 or CH) atoms separating acid and amino groups.  \r\nEven the amino acids in which the lipophilic carbon atoms extend out \r\nin a branched side-chain, valine, leucine, and isoleucine, have some \r\nof the antiseizure (inhibitory) action (Skeie, et al., 1992, 1994) of \r\nGABA and glycine. Tests done with one, or a few, of the relatively lipophilic \r\n(aliphatic) amino acids prevent seizures, while the balanced mixtures \r\nof amino acids permit seizures;unfortunately, results of this \r\nsort haven't led researchers to question the idea of balance that \r\ndeveloped within the setting of agricultural research. The \r\nsimilarity between the structures and actions of glycine and GABA suggest \r\nthat their receptors are similar, if not identical. For years, \r\nit has been known that progesterone and pregnenolone act on the GABA \r\nreceptor, to reinforce the protective, inhibitory effects of GABA. Estrogen \r\nhas the opposite effect, inhibiting GABA's action. Since GABA opposes \r\nestrogen and inhibits the growth of breast cancer, it wouldn't be surprising \r\nif glycine, alanine, etc., did the same. Recent \r\nresearch shows that progesterone and its metabolites also act on the \r\nglycine receptor, increasing inhibition, and that the phytoestrogen, \r\ngenistein, antagonizes the inhibitory effect of glycine. The \r\ninhibitory systems are opposed by excitatory systems, especially by \r\nthe excitatory amino acid system, activated by glutamic and aspartic \r\nacid. Progesterone and estrogen act on that system, too, decreasing \r\nand increasing excitation, respectively. I \r\nhave previously discussed the arguments for viewing progesterone as \r\na cardinal adsorbent (as in Ling and Fu, 1987, 1988, Ling, et \r\nal., 1984, a steroid alters glycine's influence on the cell's electrical \r\nbehavior) which increases the lipophilic, fat-loving property of the \r\ncytoplasm, and estrogen as having the opposite action, increasing the \r\nwater-loving hydrophilic quality of the cytoplasm. If we think of the \r\nproteins known as the GABA and glycine receptors as having some regions \r\nin which the basic amine of lysine associates with the acidic group \r\nof aspartic or glutamic acid, then the action of glycine, or other amino \r\nacids would be to introduce additional lipophilic carbon atoms into \r\nthose regions (with the amino acids' polar ends pairing with their opposites \r\non the protein), where the cardinal adsorbents exert their influence. Generally, \r\nbiologists seem puzzled by such facts, because they don't fit into the \r\nlock and key model of molecular biology. But I think they make \r\nthe organism easier to understand, since these constellations of facts \r\nillustrate simple and general physical principles. They suggest the \r\nidea that estrogen and progesterone and glycine, GABA, etc., will be \r\nactive in any functioning cell, at a suitable concentration. It was \r\nthis kind of thinking in terms of general physical principles that led \r\nSzent-Gyorgyi to investigate the effects of estrogen and progesterone \r\non heart physiology. The old characterization of estrogen and progesterone \r\nas sex and pregnancy hormones acting on a few tissues through \r\nspecific receptors never had a good basis in evidence, but the accumulated \r\nevidence has now made those ideas impossible for an informed person \r\nto accept. (Progesterone increases the heart's pumping efficiency, and \r\nestrogen is antagonistic, and can produce cardiac arrhythmia.) In \r\nthe context of the excitatory actions of estrogen, and the inhibitory \r\naction of glycine, it would be reasonable to think of glycine as one \r\nof the antiestrogenic substances. Another type of amino acid, taurine, \r\nis structurally similar to glycine (and to beta amino propanoic acid, \r\nand to GABA), and it can be thought of as antiestrogenic in this context. \r\nThe specific kinds of excitation produced by estrogen that relate to \r\nreproduction occur against a background of very generalized cellular \r\nexcitation, that includes increased sensitivity of sensory nerves, increased \r\nactivity of motor nerves, changes in the EEG, and, if the estrogen effect \r\nis very high, epilepsy, tetany, or psychosis. Glycine's \r\ninhibitory effects appear to oppose estrogen's actions generally, in \r\nsensory and motor nerves, in regulating angiogenesis, and in modulating \r\nthe cytokines and \"chemokines\" that are involved in so many \r\ninflammatory and degenerative diseases, especially tumor necrosis factor \r\n(TNF), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandins. Exposure to estrogen early \r\nin life can affect the health in adulthood, and so can an early deficiency \r\nof glycine. The degenerative diseases can begin in the earliest years \r\nof life, but because aging, like growth, is a developmental process, \r\nit's never too late to start the corrective process. One \r\nof estrogen's excitatory effects is to cause lipolysis, the release \r\nof fatty acids from storage fat;it directs the conversion of glucose into fat in the liver, so that \r\nthe free fatty acids in the circulation remain chronically high under \r\nits influence. The free fatty acids inhibit the oxidation of glucose \r\nfor energy, creating insulin resistance, the condition that normally \r\nincreases with aging, and that can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetes. Gelatin \r\nand glycine have recently been reported to facilitate the action of \r\ninsulin in lowering blood sugar and alleviating diabetes. Gelatin has \r\nbeen used successfully to treat diabetes for over 100 years (A. Guerard, \r\nAnn Hygiene 36, 5, 1871; H. Brat, Deut. Med. Wochenschrift 28 (No. 2), \r\n21, 1902). Glycine inhibits lipolysis (another antiexcitatory, antiestrogenic \r\neffect), and this in itself will make insulin more effective, and help \r\nto prevent hyperglycemia. (A gelatin-rich diet can also lower the serum \r\ntriglycerides.) Since persistent lipolysis and insulin resistance, along \r\nwith a generalized inflammatory state, are involved in a great variety \r\nof diseases, especially in the degenerative diseases, it's reasonable \r\nto consider using glycine/gelatin for almost any chronic problem. (Chicken \r\nfoot soup has been used in several cultures for a variety of ailments; \r\nchicken foot powder has been advocated as a stimulant for spinal cord \r\nregeneration--Harry Robertson's method was stopped by the FDA). Although \r\nHans Selye observed as early as the 1930s that stress causes internal \r\nbleeding (in lungs, adrenals, thymus, intestine, salivary and tear glands, \r\netc.), the medical establishment, which has the opportunity to see it \r\nafter surgery, burns or other trauma, and following strokes and head \r\ninjuries, prefers to explain it by \"stomach hyperacidity,\" \r\nas if it were limited to the stomach and duodenum. And the spontaneous \r\nbruising, and easy bruising, that is experienced by millions of women, \r\nespecially with the premenstrual syndrome, and nose bleeds, and scleral \r\nbleeding, purpura senilis, urinary bleeding, bleeding gums, and many \r\nother kinds of \"spontaneous\" or stress related bleeding, are \r\ntreated by main-line medicine as if they had no particular physiological \r\nsignificance. Stress \r\nis an energy problem, that leads to the series of hormonal and metabolic \r\nreactions that I have often written about--lipolysis, glycolysis, increased \r\nserotonin, cortisol, estrogen, prolactin, leaky capillaries, protein \r\ncatabolism, etc. The capillaries are among the first tissues to be damaged \r\nby stress. Although \r\nSelye showed that estrogen treatment mimics shock and stress, and that \r\nprogesterone prevents the stress reaction, the effects of these hormones \r\non the circulatory system have never been treated systematically. Katherina \r\nDalton observed that progesterone treatment prevented the spontaneous \r\nbruising of the premenstrual syndrome;Soderwall observed that \r\nestrogen caused enlargement of the adrenals, sometimes with hemorrhage \r\nand necrosis;old female animals often have bleeding in the adrenals \r\n(Dhom, et al., 1981). Strangely, estrogen's induction of uterine bleeding \r\nhas been compartmentalized, as if the endometrial blood vessels didn't \r\nfollow the same rules as vessels elsewhere in the body. Both estrogen \r\nand cortisol are known to cause clotting disorders and to increase capillary \r\nfragility, but these steroids have been elevated to the realm of billion \r\ndollar drug products, beyond the reach of ordinary physiological thinking. \r\nOther stress-released substances that are entangled in the drug market \r\n(tryptophan, serotonin, nitric oxide, and unsaturated fats, for example) \r\nare similarly exempt from consideration as factors in circulatory, neoplastic, \r\nand degenerative diseases. At \r\nthe time Selye was observing stress-induced bleeding, standard medicine \r\nwas putting gelatin to use--orally, subcutaneously, and intravenously--to \r\ncontrol bleeding. Since ancient times, it had been used to stop bleeding \r\nby applying it to wounds, and this had finally been incorporated into \r\nmedical practice. The \r\n1936 Cyclopedia of Medicine (G.M. Piersol, editor, volume 6) mentions \r\nthe use of gelatin solution to quickly control nosebleeds, excessive \r\nmenstrual bleeding, bleeding ulcers (using three doses of 18 grams as \r\na 10% solution during one day), and bleeding from hemorrhoids and the \r\nlower bowel, and hemorrhage from the bladder. But since Selye's work \r\nrelating the thrombohemorrhagic syndromes to stress wasn't known at \r\nthat time, gelatin was thought of as a useful drug, rather than as having \r\npotentially far-reaching physiological effects, antagonizing some of \r\nthe agents of stress-induced tissue damage. Skin \r\ncells and nerve cells and many other cells are electrically stabilized \r\nby glycine, and this effect is currently being described in terms of \r\na chloride current. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed \r\nfor the protective effects of some of the amino acids, based on their \r\nuse as energy or for other metabolic purpose, but there is evidence \r\nthat glycine and alanine act protectively without being metabolized, \r\nsimply by their physical properties. A \r\nsmall dose of glycine taken shortly after suffering a stroke was found \r\nto accelerate recovery, preventing the spreading of injury through its \r\ninhibitory and antiinflammatory actions. Its nerve-stabilizing action, \r\nincreasing the amount of stimulation required to activate nerves, is \r\nprotective in epilepsy, too. This effect is important in the regulation \r\nof sleep, breathing, and heart rhythm. Glycine's \r\nantispastic activity has been used to alleviate the muscle spasms of \r\nmultiple sclerosis. It is thought to moderate some of the symptoms of \r\nschizophrenia. A \r\nrecent publication shows that glycine alleviates colitis; but the use \r\nof gelatin, especially in the form of a concentrated gelatinous beef \r\nbroth, for colitis, dysentery, ulcers, celiac disease, and other diseases \r\nof the digestive system, goes far back in medical history. Pavlov's \r\nobservation of its effectiveness in stimulating the secretion of digestive \r\njuices occurred because the stimulating value of broth was already recognized. Although \r\nI pointed out a long time ago the antithyroid effects of excessive cysteine \r\nand tryptophan from eating only the muscle meats, and have been recommending \r\ngelatinous broth at bedtime to stop nocturnal stress, it took me many \r\nyears to begin to experiment with large amounts of gelatin in my diet. \r\nFocusing on the various toxic effects of tryptophan and cysteine, I \r\ndecided that using commercial gelatin, instead of broth, would be helpful \r\nfor the experiment.  For years I hadn't slept through a whole night \r\nwithout waking, and I was in the habit of having some juice or a little \r\nthyroid to help me go back to sleep. The first time I had several grams \r\nof gelatin just before bedtime, I slept without interruption for about \r\n9 hours. I mentioned this effect to some friends, and later they told \r\nme that friends and relatives of theirs had recovered from long-standing \r\npain problems (arthritic and rheumatic and possibly neurological) in \r\njust a few days after taking 10 or 15 grams of gelatin each day. For \r\na long time, gelatin's therapeutic effect in arthritis was assumed to \r\nresult from its use in repairing the cartilage or other connective tissues \r\naround joints, simply because those tissues contain so much collagen. \r\n(Marketers suggest that eating cartilage or gelatin will build cartilage \r\nor other collagenous tissue.) Some of the consumed gelatin does get \r\nincorporated into the joint cartilage, but that is a slow process, and \r\nthe relief of pain and inflammation is likely to be almost immediate, \r\nresembling the antiinflammatory effect of cortisol or aspirin. Inflammation \r\nproduces fibrosis, because stress, hypoxia, and inadequate supply of \r\nglucose stimulate the fibroblasts to produce increased amounts of collagen. \r\nIn lungs, kidneys, liver, and other tissues, glycine protects against \r\nfibrosis, the opposite of what the traditional view would suggest. Since \r\nexcess tryptophan is known to produce muscle pain, myositis, even muscular \r\ndystrophy, gelatin is an appropriate food for helping to correct those \r\nproblems, simply because of its lack of tryptophan. (Again, the popular \r\nnutritional idea of amino acids as simply building blocks for tissues \r\nis exactly wrong--muscle protein can exacerbate muscle disease.) All \r\nof the conditions involving excess prolactin, serotonin, and cortisol \r\n(autism, postpartum and premenstrual problems, Cushing's disease, \"diabetes,\" \r\nimpotence, etc.) should benefit from reduced consumption of tryptophan. \r\nBut the specifically antiinflammatory amino acids in gelatin also antagonize \r\nthe excitatory effects of the tryptophan-serotonin-estrogen- prolactin \r\nsystem. In \r\nsome of the older studies, therapeutic results improved when the daily \r\ngelatin was increased.  Since 30 grams of glycine was commonly \r\nused for treating muscular dystrophy and myasthenia gravis, a daily \r\nintake of 100 grams of gelatin wouldn't seem unreasonable, and some \r\npeople find that quantities in that range help to decrease fatigue. \r\nFor a growing child, though, such a large amount of refined gelatin \r\nwould tend to displace other important foods. The National Academy of \r\nSciences recently reviewed the requirements for working adults (male \r\nand female soldiers, in particular), and suggested that 100 grams of \r\nbalanced protein was needed for efficient work. For adults, a large \r\npart of that could be in the form of gelatin. If \r\na person eats a large serving of meat, it's probably helpful to have \r\n5 or 10 grams of gelatin at approximately the same time, so that the \r\namino acids enter the blood stream in balance. Asian \r\ngrocery stores are likely to sell some of the traditional gelatin-rich \r\nfoods, such as prepared pig skin and ears and tails, and chicken feet. Although \r\nthe prepared powdered gelatin doesn't require any cooking, dissolving \r\nit in hot water makes it digest a little more quickly. It can be incorporated \r\ninto custards, mousses, ice cream, soups, sauces, cheese cake, pies, \r\netc., or mixed with fruit juices to make desserts or (with juice concentrate) \r\ncandies. Although \r\npure glycine has its place as a useful and remarkably safe drug, it \r\nshouldn't be thought of as a food, because manufactured products are \r\nalways likely to contain peculiar contaminants.

Disaccharide \r\n-- two monosaccharides bound together; examples, sucrose, lactose, maltose. Oligosaccharide \r\n-- a short chain of monosaccharides, including disaccharides and slightly \r\nlonger chains. Polysaccharide \r\n-- example, starch, cellulose, glycogen. Glycation \r\n-- the attachment of a sugar to a protein. Lipolysis - the liberation \r\nof free fatty acids from triglycerides, the neutral form in which fats \r\nare stored, bound to glycerine. ============================================ In \r\nthe 1920s, diabetes was thought to be a disease of insulin deficiency. \r\nEventually, measurements of insulin showed that diabetics often \r\nhad normal amounts of insulin, or above-normal amounts. There are now \r\ntwo kinds of diabetes, with suggestions that the disease \r\nwill soon be further subdivided. The \r\ndegenerative diseases that are associated with hyperglycemia and commonly \r\ncalled diabetes, are only indirectly related to insulin, and as an approach \r\nto understanding or treating diabetes, the glycemic index of foods \r\nis useless. Physiologically, it has no constructive use, and very little \r\nmeaning. Insulin \r\nis important in the regulation of blood sugar, but its importance has \r\nbeen exaggerated because of the diabetes/insulin industry. Insulin itself \r\nhas been found to account for only about 8% of the \"insulin-like \r\nactivity\" of the blood, with potassium being probably the largest \r\nfactor. There probably isn't any process in the body that doesn't potentially \r\naffect blood sugar. Glucagon, \r\ncortisol, adrenalin, growth hormone and thyroid tend to increase the \r\nblood sugar, but it is common to interpret hyperglycemia as \"diabetes,\" \r\nwithout measuring any of these factors. Even when \"insulin dependent \r\ndiabetes\" is diagnosed, it isn't customary to measure the insulin \r\nto see whether it is actually deficient, before writing a prescription \r\nfor insulin. People resign themselves to a lifetime of insulin injections, \r\nwithout knowing why their blood sugar is high. Insulin release is also stimulated \r\nby amino acids such as leucine, and insulin stimulates cells to absorb \r\namino acids and to synthesize proteins. Since insulin lowers blood sugar \r\nas it disposes of amino acids, eating a large amount of protein without \r\ncarbohydrate can cause a sharp decrease in blood sugar. This leads to \r\nthe release of adrenalin and cortisol, which raise the blood sugar. \r\nAdrenalin causes fatty acids to be drawn into the blood from fat stores, \r\nespecially if the liver's glycogen stores are depleted, and cortisol \r\ncauses tissue protein to be broken down into amino acids, some of which \r\nare used in place of carbohydrate. Unsaturated fatty acids, adrenaline, \r\nand cortisol cause insulin resistance. ============================================ Professional \r\nopinion can be propagated about 10,000 times faster than research \r\ncan evaluate it, or, as C. H. Spurgeon said, \"A lie travels round \r\nthe world while Truth is putting on her boots.\" In \r\nthe 1970s, dietitians began talking about the value of including \"complex \r\ncarbohydrates\" in the diet. Many dietitians (all but one of the \r\nRegistered Dietitians that I knew of) claimed that starches were more \r\nslowly absorbed than sugars, and so should be less disruptive to the \r\nblood sugar and insulin levels. People were told to eat whole grains \r\nand legumes, and to avoid fruit juices. These recommendations, \r\nand their supporting ideology, are still rampant in the culture of the \r\nUnited States, fostered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the \r\nAmerican Dietetic Association and the American Diabetes Association \r\nand innumerable university departments of home economics, dietetics, \r\nor nutrition. Judging \r\nby present and past statements of the American Dietetic Association, \r\nI think some kind of institutional brain defect might account for their \r\nrecommendations. Although the dietetic association now feebly acknowledges \r\nthat sugars don't raise the blood sugar more quickly than starches do, \r\nthey can't get away from their absurd old recommendations, which were \r\nnever scientifically justified:Eat more starches, such as \r\nbread, cereal, and starchy vegetables--6 servings a day or more. Start \r\nthe day with cold (dry) cereal with nonfat/skim milk or a bagel with \r\none teaspoon of jelly/jam. Put starch center stage--pasta with tomato \r\nsauce, baked potato with chili, rice and stir-fried beef and vegetables. \r\nAdd cooked black beans, corn, or garbanzo beans (chickpeas) to salads \r\nor casseroles. The \r\nDietetic Association's association with General Mills, the breakfast \r\ncereal empire, (and Kellog, Nabisco, and many other food industry giants) \r\nmight have something to do with their starchy opinions. Starch-grain \r\nembolisms can cause brain damage, but major money can also make people \r\nsay stupid things. In an old \r\nexperiment, a rat was tube-fed ten grams of corn-starch paste, and then \r\nanesthetized. Ten minutes after the massive tube feeding, the professor \r\ntold the students to find how far the starch had moved along the alimentary \r\ncanal. No trace of the white paste could be found, demonstrating the \r\nspeed with which starch can be digested and absorbed. The very rapid \r\nrise of blood sugar stimulates massive release of insulin, and rapidly \r\nconverts much of the carbohydrate into fat. It was this \r\nsort of experiment that led to the concept of \"glycemic index,\" \r\nthat ranks foods according to their ability to raise the blood sugar. \r\nDavid Jenkins, in 1981, knew enough about the old studies of starch \r\ndigestion to realize that the dietitians had created a dangerous cult \r\naround the complex carbohydrates, and he did a series of measurements \r\nthat showed that starch is more glycemic than sucrose. But he \r\nsimply used the amount of increase in blood glucose during the first \r\ntwo hours after ingesting the food sample, compared to that following \r\ningestion of pure glucose, for the comparison, neglecting the physiologically \r\ncomplex facts, all of the processes involved in causing a certain amount \r\nof glucose to be present in the blood during a certain time. (Even the \r\ntaste of sweetness, without swallowing anything, can stimulate the release \r\nof glucagon, which raises blood sugar.) More \r\nimportant than the physiological vacuity of a simple glycemic measurement \r\nwas the ideology within which the whole issue developed, namely, the \r\nidea that diabetes (conceived as chronic hyperglycemia) is caused by \r\neating too much sugar, i.e., chronic hyperglycemia the illness is caused \r\nby the recurrent hyperglycemia of sugar gluttony. The experiments of \r\nBernardo Houssay (1947 Nobel laureate) in the 1940s, in which sugar \r\nand coconut oil protected against diabetes, followed by Randle's demonstration \r\nof the antagonism between fats and glucose assimilation, and the growing \r\nrecognition that polyunsaturated fatty acids cause insulin resistance \r\nand damage the pancreas, have made it clear that the dietetic obsession \r\nwith sugar in relation to diabetes has been a dangerous diversion that \r\nhas retarded the understanding of degenerative metabolic diseases. Starting \r\nwith the insulin industry, a culture of diabetes and sugar has been \r\nfabulized and expanded and modified as new commercial industries found \r\nways to profit from it. Seed oils, fish oils, breakfast cereals, soybean \r\nproducts, and other things that were never eaten by any animal in millions \r\nof years of evolution have become commonplace as foods, even as \r\nhealth foods. Although \r\nmany things condition the rate at which blood sugar rises after eating \r\ncarbohydrates, and affect the way in which blood glucose is metabolized, \r\nmaking the idea of a glycemic index highly misleading, it is true \r\nthat blood sugar and insulin responses to different foods have some \r\nmeaningful effects on physiology and health. Starch \r\nand glucose efficiently stimulate insulin secretion, and that accelerates \r\nthe disposition of glucose, activating its conversion to glycogen and \r\nfat, as well as its oxidation.Fructose inhibits the stimulation \r\nof insulin by glucose, so this means that eating ordinary sugar, sucrose \r\n(a disaccharide, consisting of glucose and fructose), in place of starch, \r\nwill reduce the tendency to store fat.Eating complex carbohydrates, \r\nrather than sugars, is a reasonable way to promote obesity. Eating starch, \r\nby increasing insulin and lowering the blood sugar, stimulates the appetite, \r\ncausing a person to eat more, so the effect on fat production becomes \r\nmuch larger than when equal amounts of sugar and starch are eaten. The \r\nobesity itself then becomes an additional physiological factor; the \r\nfat cells create something analogous to an inflammatory state. There \r\nisn't anything wrong with a high carbohydrate diet, and even a high \r\nstarch diet isn't necessarily incompatible with good health, but when \r\nbetter foods are available they should be used instead of starches. \r\nFor example, fruits have many advantages over grains, besides the difference \r\nbetween sugar and starch. Bread and pasta consumption are strongly associated \r\nwith the occurrence of diabetes, fruit consumption has a strong inverse \r\nassociation. Although \r\npure fructose and sucrose produce less glycemia than glucose and starch \r\ndo, the different effects of fruits and grains on the health can't be \r\nreduced to their effects on blood sugar. Orange \r\njuice and sucrose have a lower glycemic index than starch or whole wheat \r\nor white bread, but it is common for dietitians to argue against the \r\nuse of orange juice, because its index is the same as that of Coca Cola. \r\nBut, if the glycemic index is very important, to be rational they would \r\nhave to argue that Coke or orange juice should be substituted for white \r\nbread. After \r\ndecades of education to promote eating starchy foods, obesity \r\nis a bigger problem than ever, and more people are dying of diabetes \r\nthan previously. The age-specific incidence of most cancers is increasing, \r\ntoo, and there is evidence that starch, such as pasta, contributes to \r\nbreast cancer, and possibly other types of cancer. The \r\nepidemiology would appear to suggest that complex carbohydrates cause \r\ndiabetes, heart disease, and cancer. If the glycemic index is viewed \r\nin terms of the theory that hyperglycemia, by way of glucotoxicity, \r\ncauses the destruction of proteins by glycation, which is seen in diabetes \r\nand old age, that might seem simple and obvious.

Oxidation \r\nof sugar is metabolically efficient in many ways, including sparing \r\noxygen consumption. It produces more carbon dioxide than oxidizing fat \r\ndoes, and carbon dioxide has many protective functions, including increasing \r\nKrebs cycle activity and inhibiting toxic damage to proteins. The glycation \r\nof proteins occurs under stress, when less carbon dioxide is being produced, \r\nand the proteins are normally protected by carbon dioxide. When \r\nsugar (or starch) is turned into fat, the fats will be either saturated, \r\nor in the series derived from omega -9 monounsaturated fatty acids. \r\nWhen sugar isn't available in the diet, stored glycogen will provide \r\nsome glucose (usually for a few hours, up to a day), but as that is \r\ndepleted, protein will be metabolized to provide sugar. If protein is \r\neaten without carbohydrate, it will stimulate insulin secretion, lowering \r\nblood sugar and activating the stress response, leading to the secretion \r\nof adrenalin, cortisol, growth hormone, prolactin, and other hormones. \r\nThe adrenalin will mobilize glycogen from the liver, and (along with \r\nother hormones) will mobilize fatty acids, mainly from fat cells. Cortisol \r\nwill activate the conversion of protein to amino acids, and then to \r\nfat and sugar, for use as energy.  (If the diet doesn't contain \r\nenough protein to maintain the essential organs, especially the heart, \r\nlungs, and brain, they are supplied with protein from the skeletal muscles. \r\nBecause of the amino acid composition of the muscle proteins, their \r\ndestruction stimulates the formation of additional cortisol, to accelerate \r\nthe movement of amino acids from the less important tissues to the essential \r\nones.) The \r\ndiabetic condition is similar in many ways to stress, inflammation, \r\nand aging, for example in the chronic elevation of free fatty acids, \r\nand in various mediators of inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor \r\n(TNF). Rather \r\nthan the sustained hyperglycemia which is measured for determining the \r\nglycemic index, I think the diabetogenic or carcinogenic \r\naction of starch has to do with the stress reaction that follows the \r\nintense stimulation of insulin release. This is most easily seen after \r\na large amount of protein is eaten. Insulin is secreted in response \r\nto the amino acids, and besides stimulating cells to take up the amino \r\nacids and convert them into protein, the insulin also lowers the blood \r\nsugar. This decrease in blood sugar stimulates the formation of many \r\nhormones, including cortisol, and under the influence of cortisol both \r\nsugar and fat are produced by the breakdown of proteins, including those \r\nalready forming the tissues of the body. At the same time, adrenalin \r\nand several other hormones are causing free fatty acids to appear in \r\nthe blood. Since \r\nthe work of Cushing and Houssay, it has been understood that blood sugar \r\nis controlled by antagonistic hormones:Remove the pituitary \r\nalong with the pancreas, and the lack of insulin doesn't cause hyperglycemia. \r\nIf something increases cortisol a little, the body can maintain normal \r\nblood sugar by secreting more insulin, but that tends to increase cortisol \r\nproduction. A certain degree of glycemia is produced by a particular \r\nbalance between opposing hormones. Tryptophan, \r\nfrom dietary protein or from the catabolism of muscles, is turned into \r\nserotonin which activates the pituitary stress hormones, increasing \r\ncortisol, and intensifying catabolism, which releases more tryptophan. \r\nIt suppresses thyroid function, which leads to an increased need for \r\nthe stress hormones. Serotonin impairs glucose oxidation, and contributes \r\nto many of the problems associated with diabetes. Diabetes \r\nis often the diagnosis, when excess cortisol is the problem. The hormones \r\nhave traditionally not been measured before diagnosing diabetes and \r\nprescribing insulin or other chemical to lower the blood sugar. Some \r\nof the worst effects of diabetes, including retinal damage, are \r\ncaused or exacerbated by insulin itself. Antiserotonin \r\ndrugs can sometimes alleviate stress and normalize blood sugar. Simply \r\neating sucrose was recently discovered to restrain the stress hormone \r\nsystem (A new perspective on glucocorticoid feedback:relation \r\nto stress, carbohydrate feeding and feeling better, J Neuroendocrinol \r\n13(9), 2001, KD Laugero). The \r\nfree fatty acids released by the stress hormones serve as supplemental \r\nfuel, and increase the consumption of oxygen and the production of heat. \r\n(This increased oxygen demand is a problem for the heart when it is \r\nforced to oxidize fatty acids. [A. Grynberg, 2001]) But if the stored \r\nfats happen to be polyunsaturated, they damage the blood vessels and \r\nthe mitochondria, suppress thyroid function, and cause glycation \r\nof proteins. They also damage the pancreas, and impair insulin secretion. A \r\nrepeated small stress, or overstimulation of insulin secretion, gradually \r\ntends to become amplified by the effects of tryptophan and the polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids, with these fats increasing the formation of serotonin, \r\nand serotonin increasing the liberation of the fats. The \r\nname, glycation, indicates the addition of sugar groups to proteins, \r\nsuch as occurs in diabetes and old age, but when tested in a controlled \r\nexperiment,lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids produces \r\nthe protein damage about 23 times faster than the simple sugars do(Fu, et al., 1996). And the oxidation of fats rather than glucose means \r\nthat the proteins won't have as much protective carbon dioxide combined \r\nwith their reactive nitrogen atoms, so the real difference in the organism \r\nis likely to be greater than that seen by Fu, et al. These \r\nproducts of lipid peroxidation, HNE, MDA, acrolein, glyoxal, and other \r\nhighly reactive aldehydes, damage the mitochondria, reducing the ability \r\nto oxidize sugar, and to produce energy and protective carbon dioxide. Fish \r\noil, which is extremely unstable in the presence of oxygen and metals \r\nsuch as iron, produces some of these dangerous products very rapidly.The polyunsaturated essential fatty acids and their products, \r\narachidonic acid and many of the prostaglandin-like materials, also \r\nproduce them. When \r\nglucose can't be oxidized, for any reason, there is a stress reaction, \r\nthat mobiles free fatty acids. Drugs that oppose the hormones (such \r\nas adrenalin or growth hormone) that liberate free fatty acids have \r\nbeen used to treat diabetes, because lowering free fatty acids can restore \r\nglucose oxidation. Brief \r\nexposures to polyunsaturated fatty acids can damage the insulin-secreting \r\ncells of the pancreas, and the mitochondria in which oxidative energy \r\nproduction takes place. Prolonged exposure causes progressive damage. \r\nAcutely, the free polyunsaturated fatty acids cause capillary permeability \r\nto increase, and this can be detected at the beginning of insulin \r\nresistance or diabetes. After chronic exposure, the leakiness \r\nincreases and albumin occurs in the urine, as proteins leak out of the \r\nblood vessels. The retina and brain and other organs are damaged by \r\nthe leaking capillaries. The \r\nblood vessels and other tissues are also damaged by the chronically \r\nincreased cortisol, and at least in some tissues (the immune system \r\nis most sensitive to the interaction) the polyunsaturated fats increase \r\nthe ability of cortisol to kill the cells. When \r\ncells are stressed, they are likely to waste glucose in two ways, turning \r\nsome of it into lactic acid, and turning some into fatty acids, even \r\nwhile fats are being oxidized, in place of the sugar that is available. \r\nGrowth hormone and adrenalin, the stress-induced hormones, stimulate \r\nthe oxidation of fatty acids, as well as their liberation from storage, \r\nso the correction of energy metabolism requires the minimization of \r\nthe stress hormones, and of the free fatty acids. Prolactin, ACTH, and \r\nestrogen also cause the shift of metabolism toward the fatty acids. Sugar \r\nand thyroid hormone (T3, triiodothyronine) correct many parts of the \r\nproblem. The conversion of T4 into the active T3 requires glucose, and \r\nin diabetes, cells are deprived of glucose. Logically, all diabetics \r\nwould be functionally hypothyroid. Providing T3 and sugar tends to shift \r\nenergy metabolism away from the oxidation of fats, back to the oxidation \r\nof sugar. Niacinamide, \r\nused in moderate doses, can safely help to restrain the excessive production \r\nof free fatty acids, and also helps to limit the wasteful conversion \r\nof glucose into fat. There is evidence that diabetics are chronically \r\ndeficient in niacin. Excess fatty acids in the blood probably divert \r\ntryptophan from niacin synthesis into serotonin synthesis. Sodium, \r\nwhich is lost in hypothyroidism and diabetes, increases cellular energy. \r\nDiuretics, that cause loss of sodium, can cause apparent diabetes, with \r\nincreased glucose and fats in the blood.Thyroid, sodium, and glucose \r\nwork very closely together to maintain cellular energy and stability. In \r\nHoussay's experiments, sugar, protein, and coconut oil protected mice \r\nagainst developing diabetes. The saturated fats of coconut oil are similar \r\nto those we synthesize ourselves from sugar. Saturated fats, and the \r\npolyunsaturated fats synthesized by plants, have very different effects \r\non many important physiological processes. In every case I know about, \r\nthe vegetable polyunsaturated fats have harmful effects on our physiology. For \r\nexample, they bind to the receptor proteins for cortisol, progesterone, \r\nand estrogen, and to all of the major proteins related to thyroid function, \r\nand to the vesicles that take up nerve transmitter substances, such \r\nas glutamic acid. They \r\nallow glutamic acid to injure and kill cells through excessive stimulation; \r\nthis process is similar to the nerve damage done by cobra venom, and \r\nother toxins. Excess \r\ncortisol makes nerve cells more sensitive to excitotoxicity, but the \r\ncells are protected if they are provided with an unusually large amount \r\nof glucose. The \r\ncells of the thymus gland are very sensitive to damage by stress or \r\ncortisol, but they too can be rescued by giving them enough extra glucose \r\nto compensate for the cortisol. Polyunsaturated fatty acids have the \r\nopposite effect, sensitizing the thymus cells to cortisol. This partly \r\naccounts for the immunosuppressive effects of the polyunsaturated fats. \r\n(AIDS patients have increased cortisol and polyunsaturated fatty acids \r\nin their blood.[E.A. Nunez, 1988.]) Unsaturated \r\nfatty acids activate the stress hormones, sugar restrains them. Simply \r\nmaking animals deficient in the unsaturated vegetable oils (which \r\nallows them to synthesize their own series of animal polyunsaturated \r\nfats, which are very stable), protects them against autoimmune \r\ndiabetes, and against a variety of other immunological challenges. \r\nThe essential fatty acid deficiency increases the oxidation of \r\nglucose, as it increases the metabolic rate generally. Saturated \r\nfats improve the insulin-secreting response to glucose. The \r\nprotective effects of sugar, and the harmful effects of excessive fat \r\nmetabolism, are now being widely recognized, in every field of physiology. \r\nThe unsaturated vegetable fats, linoleic and linolenic acid and their \r\nderivatives, such as arachidonic acid and the long chain fish oils, \r\nhave excitatory, stress promoting effects, that shift metabolism away \r\nfrom the oxidation of glucose, and finally destroy the respiratory metabolism \r\naltogether. Since cell injury and death generally involve an imbalance \r\nbetween excitation and the ability to produce energy, it is significant \r\nthat the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids seems to consume energy, \r\nlowering cellular ATP (Clejan, et al, 1986). The \r\nbulk of the age-related tissue damage classified as glycation end-products \r\n(or advanced glycation end-products, AGE) is produced by decomposition \r\nof the polyunsaturated fats, rather than by sugars, and this would be \r\nminimized by the protective oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide. Protein \r\nof the right kind, in the right amount, is essential for reducing stress. \r\nGelatin, with its antiinflammatory amino acid balance, helps to regulate \r\nfat metabolism. Aspirin's \r\nantiinflammatory actions are generally important when the polyunsaturated \r\nfats are producing inflammatory and degenerative changes, and aspirin \r\nprevents many of the problems associated with diabetes, reducing vascular \r\nleakiness. It improves mitochondrial respiration (De Cristobal, et al., \r\n2002) and helps to regulate blood sugar and lipids (Yuan, et al., 2001). \r\nAspirin's broad range of beneficial effects is probably analogous to \r\nvitamin E's, being proportional to protection against the broad range \r\nof toxic effects of the polyunsaturated essential fatty acids.

Nepsilon-(Carboxymethyl)lysine \r\n(CML) is an advanced glycation end product formed on protein by combined \r\nnonenzymatic glycation and oxidation (glycoxidation) reactions.

The results suggests \r\nthat the steady state levels of these markers depend on the levels of \r\nthyroid hormones, presumably through theircombined effects on the \r\nrates of protein degradation and oxidative stress,whereas DNA is \r\nmore protected from oxidative damage.

Students, patients, and discoveryFor \r\nthe real world has inexhaustible splendour, the real life is full of \r\nmeaning and abundance, where we grasp it, it is full of miracles and \r\nglory.N. Hartmann\"I \r\nam myself plus my circumstances\"Jose Ortega y \r\nGassetKnowledge \r\nshould be useful and provisional.I \r\nthink comparing the doctor-patient relationship with the teacher-student \r\nrelationship can be useful, and it might suggest ways that both of them \r\ncould be made more productive, with implications for the nature of learning \r\nand knowing.40 \r\nor 50 years ago, advocates of student-centered education were encouraged \r\nby the popularity of psychologist Carl Rogers' client centered therapy. \r\nRogers was interested in what made some therapists successful, and he \r\nfound that their personality and attitude, not their theories or techniques, \r\naccounted for their success. Successful therapists had three essential \r\ntraits. They offered their clients acceptance or unconditional positive \r\nregard and empathic understanding, and they themselves were congruent, \r\nnot presenting a facade of authority or esoteric knowledge. According \r\nto Rogers, accurate diagnosis and specific treatment didn't \r\nhave anything to do with helping the client.Some \r\ntherapists thought Rogers' approach was impractical, others were sure \r\nit was foolish. Medically oriented psychiatrists saw Roger's prestige \r\namong psychologists as evidence that psychology wasn't suited for dealing \r\nwith the mentally ill, who needed authoritative diagnosis and \r\ntreatment--such as drugs, convulsive shock, or surgery. Scientifically, \r\nhowever, Rogers' ideas were supported by evidence, and medical psychiatry \r\nhad no evidence to support many of its diagnostic concepts or their \r\ntherapeutic usefulness.Most \r\nuniversity professors felt that Rogers' ideas were irrelevant to their \r\neducational work, and some clearly saw their own function as being a \r\nsort of Malthusian selection of the fittest, and deliberately designed \r\ntheir classes as barriers that only a few could surmount.When \r\nI taught English composition, instructors were told that they must grade \r\naccording to a standard scoring system for errors of grammar, punctuation, \r\nspelling, and diction. Our success was seen in terms of the number of \r\nfreshmen who had dropped out by the end of the year, as evidence that \r\nthe department had high standards. Knowing that system, most students \r\nchose to write in the style of the first grade See Spot run readers, \r\nhoping that they could handle the mechanics of writing if they reduced \r\nthe complexity and content of their essays. It didn't work, and they \r\ndidn't improve during the weeks when their mistakes were being brought \r\npainfully to their attention. Since I hated reading their meaningless \r\nefforts, I told them that I was going to grade them on content, rather \r\nthan punctuation and spelling, and that they should try to write about \r\nsomething that was important to them. Only their success in communicating \r\nsomething would be graded. Their papers became more readable, and the \r\ninteresting thing was that the mechanical things improved immediately. \r\n(The intention to communicate something is the real source of structure \r\nin language.) I had another teacher score some of their compositions, \r\nand he confirmed that they had improved according to the department's \r\nsystem. The attempt to steer a person can make it hard for them to move, \r\nbecause it inactivates their own guidance system.A \r\nphysics professor would notice that writing classes have a lot in common \r\nwith psychotherapy, and would dismiss the possibility that such an approach \r\ncould be used in serious education.Professors \r\nof medicine see themselves as models of the authority that their students \r\nwill need to apply in dealing with patients, and the physicians trained \r\nin the authoritarian style are likely to see their patients as recipients \r\nof their medical knowledge, rather than as occasions for listening and \r\nlearning something new.Students \r\nentering these disciplines must expect to be disciplined. This means \r\nthat they learn not to ask silly questions about the fundamental assumptions \r\nof their profession. Their common sense of meaning, their original guidance \r\nsystem, must be inactivated to keep them from asking questions such \r\nas is that a disease or a theory? Some patients find that their \r\nphysician has little patience for their questions, but most patients \r\ndon't want to ask questions, because they have been taught to respect \r\nthe authorities.Our \r\nnervous systems are made up of physiology and culture.That \r\ncan be a philosophical problem, because our experience is governed by \r\nour composition. In people like Heraclitus, physiology was in the foreground, \r\nand in people like Plato, culture was in the foreground. (Heraclitus \r\nunderstood that things are always becoming, Plato believed that change \r\nwasn't real.) To change someone's mind, it's necessary to change the \r\nway they experience themselves and the world, and that requires changing \r\ntheir substance.In \r\nthe 1950s a group called Synectics was formed to study the creative \r\nprocess. They found that having an expert in the group could be useful, \r\nbut it could also often stifle the group's ability to find a good solution \r\nto a problem. W.J.J. Gordon described their method as \"trusting \r\nthings that are alien, and alienating things that are trusted.\" \r\nThey used metaphorical thinking to help them to see the complexity and \r\npotentiality of a situation, and to go beyond the existing understanding.Professors \r\nand physicians too often present themselves as having definitive \r\nknowledge about a subject. For people who already have definitive \r\nknowledge about something, anomalous facts (if they are perceived \r\nat all) will simply remain anomalous and will be quickly forgotten. \r\nThe things they produce will be extensions of what already exists. For \r\nothers, things that aren't easily explained have special interest, and \r\ncause them to ask new questions. New perspectives can lead to new possibilities \r\nand new realities.Once \r\nduring a lecture, Alfred Korzybski offered his students some cookies, \r\nwhich they seemed to enjoy, then he showed them a label on the bag, \r\ndog cookies, and some of them felt sick. \"I have just demonstrated \r\nthat people don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste \r\nof the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter.\" Hypnotists \r\nhave often demonstrated that words can have physiological effects.Many \r\nof our institutions use language as a system for preserving culture, \r\nthat is, for preventing change. Korzybski wanted to correct the cultural \r\nhabit of making abstractions seem like objects or elements, by \r\nmaking people aware of the degree of abstraction in their words. This \r\ncan be useful, but his book has been used to promote an extreme linguistic \r\nrelativism in the theory of knowledge and science, placing meaning \r\nentirely within the nervous system.This \r\napproach evades the fact that patterns exist objectively, and that they \r\ncan be perceived as they unfold through time. Although Korzybski thought \r\nhe was teaching people to overcome the limitations of thinking in the \r\nstyle of Aristotle or Plato, he was supporting an attitude that would \r\nmake it impossible to perceive in the style of Heraclitus.If \r\nHeraclitus said it's impossible to step in the same river twice, his \r\ncomment was directed to those who ignore the rich complexity of experience \r\nbecause of stereotyped elemental thinking. He was pointing to \r\nthe abundance of the world, but elemental-concept thinkers have felt \r\nthat he simply negated their objective meanings.To \r\nperceive another person accurately requires the ability to perceive \r\nthe person as a pattern unfolding coherently through time, as a potential \r\nrealizing itself. Carl Rogers' insight was that one's awareness of being \r\nperceived in this way encourages the unfolding of potentials.The \r\nrefusal of institutions or individuals to perceive others in this way \r\nis an imposition of their way of understanding, and is itself a form \r\nof oppression. People who think in terms of professional training \r\noften describe learning in terms of conditioned reflexes, producing \r\na desired response to each stimulus.The \r\nterms conditioned reflex and conditioning were introduced \r\ninto psychology by the behaviorist J. B. Watson, who mistranslated and \r\nmisrepresented Pavlov's ideas, and who insisted that the ideas of consciousness, \r\nvolition, and self should be eliminated from the science of psychology.The \r\norienting reflex, the alertness provoked by something new, was described \r\nby Sechenov in 1863, and explored by Pavlov (who also called it the \r\nwhatisthat? reflex and the exploration reflex) \r\nwho considered it to be our most basic and most powerful reflex. The \r\nfact that novelty powerfully arouses our exploratory systems means that \r\nwe have a mental image of our familiar environment, and that a change \r\nin that environment requires us to investigate the properties of the \r\nnew thing, to see whether it can be explained by the things we already \r\nknow, or whether it requires us to change our basic ideas about our \r\nplace in our surroundings. For Pavlov, the study of psychology or physiology \r\nwithout consciousness was simply crazy.Pavlov \r\nsaid that he studied nutrition to understand consciousness and the nervous \r\nsystem, because eating is our closest interaction with the world. Our \r\nbrain is part of our digestive system. But eating has become highly \r\ninstitutionalized and influenced by our cultural beliefs. If people \r\nbegin to think about the meanings of eating, they are beginning a process \r\nof cultural and philosophical criticism.Helping \r\npeople with physical problems (such as obesity, headaches or joint or \r\nnerve pain, or named diseases) and helping people who want to understand \r\nsomething about the world beyond themselves, are structurally similar, \r\nbut in the issues of health the questions and the potential answers \r\nare more clearly present and immediate.The \r\nSynectics group began with the study of artistic creation, but they \r\nfound that it was easier to evaluate their progress when they concentrated \r\non technical invention. They found, as Pavlov had, that consciousness \r\nand meaning could best be studied in concrete situations. The process \r\nof goal-seeking was to be studied in action.I \r\nsee the therapeutic or educational or productive situation as a goal-directed \r\nbiological and social interaction, and the goal can be either the creation \r\nof something new and better, or simply the preservation and application \r\nof something already existing.Until \r\njust about a generation ago, teleology (especially in biological \r\nexplanation) was considered to be metaphysical and inappropriate for \r\nscience. Norbert Wiener, who coined the word cybernetics (from \r\nGreek for proficient pilot or good steersman) helped to \r\nchange attitudes toward the word when he used the phrase teleological \r\nmechanism to describe cybernetic control systems.A \r\ngoal-directed system is one that senses its actions and makes adaptations \r\nso that its actions can be refined to achieve a purpose. Between 1932 \r\nand 1935, a student and colleague of Pavlov's, P.K. Anokhin, developed \r\nthis idea of self-regulating systems, and originated the concept of \r\nfeedback, in describing the ways organisms guide themselves and their \r\nadaptations. Building on Pavlov's work, and investigating the origins \r\nof innate reflexes, he found principles that would explain the origin \r\nof organs and their functions, and that would also apply to the interactions \r\nbetween individuals. The functional system on any level, in embryology, \r\npsychology, or society, is a sequence of interactions with a useful \r\nresult. Movement towards a goal is adaptive, and the system is shaped \r\nby the adaptations it makes in moving toward the goal. Resources are \r\nmobilized to meet needs, changing the system as it moves towards its \r\ngoal.Since \r\nthere is always novelty in the real world as contexts change, the exploratory \r\nfunction is causing us to continually revise our understanding. Every \r\nquestion forms a functional system, and our brain adapts as we find \r\nanswers.This \r\nkind of systems theory and self-regulation theory developed along with \r\nthe field theories in embryology, psychology, chemistry, and some branches \r\nof physics. Pattern and analogy were central to their approach. The \r\nfunctional systems are processes that occupy time and space.The \r\nfield idea in biology (wholes shaping themselves) can be understood \r\nby considering its opposite, the belief that cells are guided by their \r\ngenes (producing a mosaic of parts). That idea, in its extreme form, \r\nclaimed that cells contained an internal map and an internal clock telling \r\nthem when and where to move and how to change their form and function \r\nas they matured and aged. In reality, cells communicate with surrounding \r\ncells and with the material between cells. The existence of long-range \r\nordering processes between atoms, molecules, and cells threatened some \r\nof the central dogmas of the sciences.Although \r\nNorbert Wiener popularized some aspects of the teleological approach \r\nto regulatory systems in the 1950s, and saw analogies between the teleological \r\nmachines and the way the brain functions in Parkinson's disease, by \r\n1950 the digital approach to information processing, storage, and transmission \r\nwas displacing analog devices in computation and engineering, and was \r\ncompatible with theories of intelligence, such as neo-Kantianism, that \r\nbelieved that human intelligence can be defined precisely, in terms \r\nof discrete rules and operations.  Field thinking in embryology, \r\ncancer theory, psychology, and other sciences effectively disappeared--or \r\nwas disappeared, for ideological reasons.Wiener's \r\ngoal-directed machines, like Anokhin's functional systems, worked in \r\nspace and time, and the idea of steering or guidance assumes a context \r\nof time and space in which the adjustments or adaptations are made. \r\nAnalog computers and control systems in various ways involved formal \r\nparallels with reality. The components of the system, like reality, \r\noccupied space and time.Digital \r\ncomputers, with their different history and functions, for example their \r\nuse for creating or breaking military codes, didn't intrinsically model \r\nreality in any way. Information had to be encoded and processed by systems \r\nof definitions. A sequence of binary digits has meaning only in terms \r\nof someone's arbitrary definitions.Parallel \r\nwith the development of electronic digital computing machines, binary \r\ndigital theories of brain function were being developed, by people who \r\nsubscribed to views of knowledge very different from those of Anokhin \r\nand Wiener. (Anokhin argued against the idea that nerves use a simple \r\nbinary code.) These computer models of intelligence justify educational \r\npractices based on authoritative knowledge and conditioned (arbitrary) \r\nreflexes. Neo-Kantianism has been the dominant academic philosophy in \r\nthe U.S., turning philosophy into epistemology to exclude ontology. \r\n\"Operationism\" and logical positivism share with neo-Kantianism \r\nits elimination of ontology (concern with being itself).In \r\nthe 1960s, Ludwig von Bertalanffy developed a theory of systems, defining \r\na system as an arrayed multitude of inter-linked elements. Although \r\nit was intended as a description of biological systems, it reduced the \r\nteleological factors, needs and goals, to a kind of mechanical inner \r\nprogram, such as regulatory genes. Following old modes of thought, \r\nsome called this orderliness of life 'purposiveness' and sought for \r\nthe 'purpose' of an organ or function. However, in the concept of a \r\n'purpose' a desiring or intending of the goal always appeared to be \r\ninvolved--the type of idea to which the natural scientist is justly \r\nunsympathetic (von Bertalanffy).His \r\nsystem theory was highly compatible with programmed digital computers, \r\nthat could define the interactions of elements, but unlike Anokhin's \r\ndefinition of functional systems, it lacked a pattern-forming mechanism. \r\nIn Anokhin's view, the system is formed by seeking its goal, and perceiving \r\nits progress toward the goal.Carl \r\nRogers' approach to person-centered processes recognized that the interacting \r\ntherapist and client or teacher and student were a formative system, \r\nrather than just an occasion for one to inform the other.In \r\nthe Synectics group, they learned to identify the types of deeply involved \r\ninteraction that would lead to the best inventions. As in Anokhin's \r\nfunctional systems, resources are mobilized or generated as they are \r\nneeded. Like Anokhin, they showed that the process of creating something \r\nnew can be understood and controlled.Every \r\nmeaningful interaction involves formative systems.Stimulation \r\nof sensory nerves can cause cells to move into the stimulated area, \r\ncausing the organ to grow. Environmental enrichment causes brains to \r\nbecome larger, and to metabolize at a higher rate. All of these processes, \r\nfrom the level of energy production to the birth of new cells and the \r\ncreation of new patterns in the brain, are called up in the formation \r\nof a functional system.The \r\nstudies of organismic coherence by Mae-Wan Ho and Fritz Popp appear \r\nto support the idea that even the alignment of molecules in cells is \r\nresponsive to the state of the entire organism.The \r\nreason this seems implausible to most biologists is that cells are commonly \r\nstill seen as analogous to little test-tubes in which chemical processes \r\noccur as the result of random collisions between molecules floating \r\nin water.  But Sidney Bernhard's study of glycolysis showed that \r\nthe reactive sugar molecules are passed individually from one enzyme \r\nto the next, in an orderly manner.In \r\nthis system, the flow of energy, a series of oxidations and reductions \r\nchanging glucose into other substances, effectively pulls the \r\nmolecules through the system, contributing to order on a molecular level. \r\nFunction creates structure, which supports function.Self-regulating \r\nsystems are self-ordering systems. When a person is allowed to function \r\nfreely as a goal-directed, questioning system, the formation of patterns \r\nin the brain will be spontaneous and appropriate, and orderly. Knowing \r\nis the ability to hold patterns in awareness. Knowledge, rather than \r\nbeing stored like money in the bank, is something that is regenerated, \r\nor generated, as we need it.When \r\nour own steering system is commandeered by the authorities, our patterns \r\nof knowledge will be compartmented, and arranged in a fixed pattern. \r\nThis kind of knowledge either deteriorates, or it seeks more of its \r\nown kind.While \r\nself-regulation and the generation of knowledge are pleasurable, having \r\nknowledge imposed isn't.Korzybski \r\nwas right in warning about the dangers of letting names become elements. \r\nThis perception led Paolo Freire to emphasize the educational importance \r\nof critically giving things their appropriate names, rather than just \r\nbanking the names given by an authority. To exist, humanly, \r\nis to name the world, to change it.Once named, the world in its \r\nturn reappears to the namers as a problem and requires of them a new \r\nnaming.Human beings are not built in silence, but in word, in work, \r\nin action-reflection. . . . to speak a true word is to transform \r\nthe world. 'Problem-posing' education, responding to the essence \r\nof consciousness--intentionality--rejects communiques and embodies communication \r\n(Freire, 1993).Having \r\nthe power to assign names is a source of power and wealth. The pharmaceutical \r\nindustry has been accused of inventing new diseases to sell new drugs \r\nfor treating them. Old definitions of cancer are hard to change, when \r\nthe medical profession has invested so much in treatments--radiation \r\nand cytotoxic chemotherapy--which conflict with newer biological understanding \r\nof cancer.The \r\nperson who is learning is critically interacting with both nature and \r\nculture, with practical issues and theories.Applying \r\nthis to practical problems of health and nutrition, a first step is \r\nto begin to think about which things are theories or deductions from \r\ntheories, which are habits, and which things are felt needs or appetites, \r\nand to get in the habit of watching processes or things--such as signs \r\nand symptoms--develop through time.With \r\npractice, people can begin to see themselves as functional systems in \r\ntheir main activities, such as eating, and to watch how their needs \r\ninfluence their actions, and what effects different ways of eating have \r\non their other functions, such as sleeping and working. Do appetites \r\ngovern the timing of meals and the choice of foods? How does the time \r\nof day or time of month affect appetites? People often watch for effects \r\nof foods, but usually only for a few minutes or hours after eating. \r\nSome foods can produce symptoms days after they were eaten, and the \r\nactivation of the digestive system by a recent meal can cause a reaction \r\nto something eaten previously.Our \r\ntraditional cultures, and advertising and schools give us definitions \r\nand expectations relating to foods and symptoms and physiology, and \r\nthey teach us to think of our bodies in terms of an immune system, \r\nendocrine system, digestive system, nervous system, \r\nand circulatory system, which are mainly anatomical concepts that \r\nare more useful to the drug companies than to the consumer of culture. \r\nBoth conventional and alternative approaches to medicine and health \r\nare likely to let those arbitrary ideas of systems cause them to overlook \r\nreal, but unnamed, processes.When \r\nthe organism is seen as a mosaic of parts, rather than as a system of \r\ndeveloping fields, medical treatments for one part, such as the circulatory \r\nsystem, are likely to cause problems in other systems, because \r\nthe parts being treated don't exist as such in the real organism, \r\nwith the result that the treatments are seldom biologically reasonable.Besides \r\nlearning to perceive one's own physiology and becoming aware of the \r\nprocesses of perceiving and knowing so that they can be improved, it's \r\nimportant to seek information to expand the interpretive framework, \r\nand to look for new contexts and implications.Reading \r\nwith a critical imagination is as important for science as it is for \r\nliterature or advertising. Good literature often opens expansive new \r\nways of seeing the world, and good science writing can do that too, \r\nbut too often scientific publications have ulterior motives, and should \r\nbe read the way advertising propaganda is read.Some \r\npublications now require authors to state their conflicts of interest \r\n(such as receiving money from a drug company while testing a drug), \r\nbut editors and publishers, who choose which studies will be published, \r\nseldom reveal their conflicts of interest. As Marcia Angell showed, \r\neditorial choices can turn statistical randomness into statistical significance. \r\nPrivate ownership of science journals permits control of their content.Besides \r\nbeing aware of the conflicts of interest and the frequent insignificance \r\nof statistical significance, it's possible to recognize some features \r\nof the style of argument which is often used in science propaganda. \r\nA deductive style, rather than a descriptive and inductive style is \r\nextremely common in technical writing, and it should always lead the \r\nreader to question the principle from which deductions are made.Membranes \r\nare made from Essential Fatty Acids, therefore those fatty acids are \r\nnutritionally essential. But cells can multiply in a culture medium \r\nthat provides no fats. In biology, the most popular principles \r\nare simply dogmatic beliefs about genes and membranes.In \r\nphysics, where testable inferences can be drawn from arbitrary assumptions \r\nor doctrines, predictions that may be made based on different assumptions \r\nare often ignored for ideological reasons. This ideological quality \r\nof physics can permeate the other sciences when they use reductionist \r\nexplanations.Korzybski \r\nfelt he was helping humanity to escape word magic and to advance \r\nto a mathematical view of the world. But the same processes that caused \r\npeople to confuse words with things can cause people to confuse \r\nmathematical descriptions with reality.Chaos \r\ntheory, which was a faddish excitement about the ability to generate \r\nunpredictable output from a simple rule (which could be endlessly repeated \r\nby a computer), has been suggested to explain many things in biology, \r\nincluding heart rate variability. It doesn't. Instead, it has probably \r\nhad a slightly harmful effect, by distracting attention from real biological \r\npattern- forming processes.Real \r\nsubstance can sometimes be modeled by descriptions of randomness, but \r\nsubstances at all levels have intrinsic pattern-forming tendencies, \r\nand context-dependent histories. Water, for example, has structure and \r\nstructural memory that can affect even simple chemical reactions, and \r\neven gases have internal complexities that are often ignored. Real observations \r\nshouldn't be displaced by theories. The ideal and identical atoms of \r\nthe reductionists are a crude fantasy, invented, more or less consciously, \r\nto serve their ideological purposes. One purpose has been to justify \r\ntheir abstract models of reality. A particularly noxious way of modeling \r\nreality has been based on the assumption of randomness, justifying a \r\nstatistical view of all things.The \r\nneo-Kantian philosophy that has dominated US universities for more than \r\na century argues that our senses (even when extended instrumentally) \r\nare limited, so our knowledge must be limited--we can only speak of \r\ntheories or interpretations, not of being. The world we see is, according \r\nto them, only an artifact of our senses. A popular example is that the \r\nflower a bee sees is different from the flower a human sees, because \r\nthe bee's eye is sensitive to ultraviolet light. (The triviality of \r\nthe example is shown by the fact that when a person's lens is removed \r\nbecause of a cataract, ultraviolet light becomes visible, because it \r\nis no longer blocked by the tissue that is many times thicker than a \r\nbee's lens.) There is a straw-man quality to their arguments against \r\nphilosophical realism and empirical science:No one claims that our senses deliver complete knowledge all at once. \r\nWhat the realists claim is that interacting with the world is an endless \r\nsource of valid knowledge.When \r\nreading science articles, or listening to lectures, and even while privately \r\nthinking about experiences, it can be useful to watch for the improper \r\nuse of assumptions. Our understanding has been shaped by the assumptions \r\nof our culture, and these assumptions present an attitude toward the \r\nnature of the world, in some cases even about the ontology that our \r\nphilosophers have said is beyond our reach. Evolution is shaped by \r\nrandom mutations, nuclear decay is random, the universe \r\nis expanding, entropy only increases, DNA controls inheritance, \r\nmembrane pumps keep cells alive, and all of the negative assumptions \r\nthat have for so long denied the systematic generation of order.Every \r\ncommunicative interaction is an opportunity for the discovery of new \r\nmeanings and potentials.===========Aristotelian \r\nmotto: If the knower and the known form a functional system they are \r\nsubstantially the same.===========REFERENCESP.K. \r\nAnokhin: 1975,The essays on physiology of functional systems.1978,Philosophical aspects of the theory of functional systems.1998,Cybernetics of functional systems: Selected works,Moscow, \r\nMedicine, 400 p., (in Russian).Pedagogy \r\nof the Oppressed,by Paulo Freire.

Hartmann \"I \r\nam myself plus my circumstances\"Jose Ortega y \r\nGasset Knowledge \r\nshould be useful and provisional. I \r\nthink comparing the doctor-patient relationship with the teacher-student \r\nrelationship can be useful, and it might suggest ways that both of them \r\ncould be made more productive, with implications for the nature of learning \r\nand knowing. 40 \r\nor 50 years ago, advocates of student-centered education were encouraged \r\nby the popularity of psychologist Carl Rogers' client centered therapy. \r\nRogers was interested in what made some therapists successful, and he \r\nfound that their personality and attitude, not their theories or techniques, \r\naccounted for their success. Successful therapists had three essential \r\ntraits. They offered their clients acceptance or unconditional positive \r\nregard and empathic understanding, and they themselves were congruent, \r\nnot presenting a facade of authority or esoteric knowledge. According \r\nto Rogers, accurate diagnosis and specific treatment didn't \r\nhave anything to do with helping the client. Some \r\ntherapists thought Rogers' approach was impractical, others were sure \r\nit was foolish. Medically oriented psychiatrists saw Roger's prestige \r\namong psychologists as evidence that psychology wasn't suited for dealing \r\nwith the mentally ill, who needed authoritative diagnosis and \r\ntreatment--such as drugs, convulsive shock, or surgery. Scientifically, \r\nhowever, Rogers' ideas were supported by evidence, and medical psychiatry \r\nhad no evidence to support many of its diagnostic concepts or their \r\ntherapeutic usefulness. Most \r\nuniversity professors felt that Rogers' ideas were irrelevant to their \r\neducational work, and some clearly saw their own function as being a \r\nsort of Malthusian selection of the fittest, and deliberately designed \r\ntheir classes as barriers that only a few could surmount. When \r\nI taught English composition, instructors were told that they must grade \r\naccording to a standard scoring system for errors of grammar, punctuation, \r\nspelling, and diction. Our success was seen in terms of the number of \r\nfreshmen who had dropped out by the end of the year, as evidence that \r\nthe department had high standards. Knowing that system, most students \r\nchose to write in the style of the first grade See Spot run readers, \r\nhoping that they could handle the mechanics of writing if they reduced \r\nthe complexity and content of their essays. It didn't work, and they \r\ndidn't improve during the weeks when their mistakes were being brought \r\npainfully to their attention. Since I hated reading their meaningless \r\nefforts, I told them that I was going to grade them on content, rather \r\nthan punctuation and spelling, and that they should try to write about \r\nsomething that was important to them. Only their success in communicating \r\nsomething would be graded. Their papers became more readable, and the \r\ninteresting thing was that the mechanical things improved immediately. \r\n(The intention to communicate something is the real source of structure \r\nin language.) I had another teacher score some of their compositions, \r\nand he confirmed that they had improved according to the department's \r\nsystem. The attempt to steer a person can make it hard for them to move, \r\nbecause it inactivates their own guidance system. A \r\nphysics professor would notice that writing classes have a lot in common \r\nwith psychotherapy, and would dismiss the possibility that such an approach \r\ncould be used in serious education. Professors \r\nof medicine see themselves as models of the authority that their students \r\nwill need to apply in dealing with patients, and the physicians trained \r\nin the authoritarian style are likely to see their patients as recipients \r\nof their medical knowledge, rather than as occasions for listening and \r\nlearning something new. Students \r\nentering these disciplines must expect to be disciplined. This means \r\nthat they learn not to ask silly questions about the fundamental assumptions \r\nof their profession. Their common sense of meaning, their original guidance \r\nsystem, must be inactivated to keep them from asking questions such \r\nas is that a disease or a theory? Some patients find that their \r\nphysician has little patience for their questions, but most patients \r\ndon't want to ask questions, because they have been taught to respect \r\nthe authorities. Our \r\nnervous systems are made up of physiology and culture. That \r\ncan be a philosophical problem, because our experience is governed by \r\nour composition. In people like Heraclitus, physiology was in the foreground, \r\nand in people like Plato, culture was in the foreground. (Heraclitus \r\nunderstood that things are always becoming, Plato believed that change \r\nwasn't real.) To change someone's mind, it's necessary to change the \r\nway they experience themselves and the world, and that requires changing \r\ntheir substance. In \r\nthe 1950s a group called Synectics was formed to study the creative \r\nprocess. They found that having an expert in the group could be useful, \r\nbut it could also often stifle the group's ability to find a good solution \r\nto a problem. W.J.J. Gordon described their method as \"trusting \r\nthings that are alien, and alienating things that are trusted.\" \r\nThey used metaphorical thinking to help them to see the complexity and \r\npotentiality of a situation, and to go beyond the existing understanding. Professors \r\nand physicians too often present themselves as having definitive \r\nknowledge about a subject. For people who already have definitive \r\nknowledge about something, anomalous facts (if they are perceived \r\nat all) will simply remain anomalous and will be quickly forgotten. \r\nThe things they produce will be extensions of what already exists. For \r\nothers, things that aren't easily explained have special interest, and \r\ncause them to ask new questions. New perspectives can lead to new possibilities \r\nand new realities. Once \r\nduring a lecture, Alfred Korzybski offered his students some cookies, \r\nwhich they seemed to enjoy, then he showed them a label on the bag, \r\ndog cookies, and some of them felt sick. \"I have just demonstrated \r\nthat people don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste \r\nof the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter.\" Hypnotists \r\nhave often demonstrated that words can have physiological effects. Many \r\nof our institutions use language as a system for preserving culture, \r\nthat is, for preventing change. Korzybski wanted to correct the cultural \r\nhabit of making abstractions seem like objects or elements, by \r\nmaking people aware of the degree of abstraction in their words. This \r\ncan be useful, but his book has been used to promote an extreme linguistic \r\nrelativism in the theory of knowledge and science, placing meaning \r\nentirely within the nervous system. This \r\napproach evades the fact that patterns exist objectively, and that they \r\ncan be perceived as they unfold through time. Although Korzybski thought \r\nhe was teaching people to overcome the limitations of thinking in the \r\nstyle of Aristotle or Plato, he was supporting an attitude that would \r\nmake it impossible to perceive in the style of Heraclitus. If \r\nHeraclitus said it's impossible to step in the same river twice, his \r\ncomment was directed to those who ignore the rich complexity of experience \r\nbecause of stereotyped elemental thinking. He was pointing to \r\nthe abundance of the world, but elemental-concept thinkers have felt \r\nthat he simply negated their objective meanings. To \r\nperceive another person accurately requires the ability to perceive \r\nthe person as a pattern unfolding coherently through time, as a potential \r\nrealizing itself. Carl Rogers' insight was that one's awareness of being \r\nperceived in this way encourages the unfolding of potentials. The \r\nrefusal of institutions or individuals to perceive others in this way \r\nis an imposition of their way of understanding, and is itself a form \r\nof oppression. People who think in terms of professional training \r\noften describe learning in terms of conditioned reflexes, producing \r\na desired response to each stimulus. The \r\nterms conditioned reflex and conditioning were introduced \r\ninto psychology by the behaviorist J. B. Watson, who mistranslated and \r\nmisrepresented Pavlov's ideas, and who insisted that the ideas of consciousness, \r\nvolition, and self should be eliminated from the science of psychology. The \r\norienting reflex, the alertness provoked by something new, was described \r\nby Sechenov in 1863, and explored by Pavlov (who also called it the \r\nwhatisthat? reflex and the exploration reflex) \r\nwho considered it to be our most basic and most powerful reflex. The \r\nfact that novelty powerfully arouses our exploratory systems means that \r\nwe have a mental image of our familiar environment, and that a change \r\nin that environment requires us to investigate the properties of the \r\nnew thing, to see whether it can be explained by the things we already \r\nknow, or whether it requires us to change our basic ideas about our \r\nplace in our surroundings. For Pavlov, the study of psychology or physiology \r\nwithout consciousness was simply crazy. Pavlov \r\nsaid that he studied nutrition to understand consciousness and the nervous \r\nsystem, because eating is our closest interaction with the world. Our \r\nbrain is part of our digestive system. But eating has become highly \r\ninstitutionalized and influenced by our cultural beliefs. If people \r\nbegin to think about the meanings of eating, they are beginning a process \r\nof cultural and philosophical criticism. Helping \r\npeople with physical problems (such as obesity, headaches or joint or \r\nnerve pain, or named diseases) and helping people who want to understand \r\nsomething about the world beyond themselves, are structurally similar, \r\nbut in the issues of health the questions and the potential answers \r\nare more clearly present and immediate. The \r\nSynectics group began with the study of artistic creation, but they \r\nfound that it was easier to evaluate their progress when they concentrated \r\non technical invention. They found, as Pavlov had, that consciousness \r\nand meaning could best be studied in concrete situations. The process \r\nof goal-seeking was to be studied in action. I \r\nsee the therapeutic or educational or productive situation as a goal-directed \r\nbiological and social interaction, and the goal can be either the creation \r\nof something new and better, or simply the preservation and application \r\nof something already existing. Until \r\njust about a generation ago, teleology (especially in biological \r\nexplanation) was considered to be metaphysical and inappropriate for \r\nscience. Norbert Wiener, who coined the word cybernetics (from \r\nGreek for proficient pilot or good steersman) helped to \r\nchange attitudes toward the word when he used the phrase teleological \r\nmechanism to describe cybernetic control systems. A \r\ngoal-directed system is one that senses its actions and makes adaptations \r\nso that its actions can be refined to achieve a purpose. Between 1932 \r\nand 1935, a student and colleague of Pavlov's, P.K. Anokhin, developed \r\nthis idea of self-regulating systems, and originated the concept of \r\nfeedback, in describing the ways organisms guide themselves and their \r\nadaptations. Building on Pavlov's work, and investigating the origins \r\nof innate reflexes, he found principles that would explain the origin \r\nof organs and their functions, and that would also apply to the interactions \r\nbetween individuals. The functional system on any level, in embryology, \r\npsychology, or society, is a sequence of interactions with a useful \r\nresult. Movement towards a goal is adaptive, and the system is shaped \r\nby the adaptations it makes in moving toward the goal. Resources are \r\nmobilized to meet needs, changing the system as it moves towards its \r\ngoal. Since \r\nthere is always novelty in the real world as contexts change, the exploratory \r\nfunction is causing us to continually revise our understanding. Every \r\nquestion forms a functional system, and our brain adapts as we find \r\nanswers. This \r\nkind of systems theory and self-regulation theory developed along with \r\nthe field theories in embryology, psychology, chemistry, and some branches \r\nof physics. Pattern and analogy were central to their approach. The \r\nfunctional systems are processes that occupy time and space. The \r\nfield idea in biology (wholes shaping themselves) can be understood \r\nby considering its opposite, the belief that cells are guided by their \r\ngenes (producing a mosaic of parts). That idea, in its extreme form, \r\nclaimed that cells contained an internal map and an internal clock telling \r\nthem when and where to move and how to change their form and function \r\nas they matured and aged. In reality, cells communicate with surrounding \r\ncells and with the material between cells. The existence of long-range \r\nordering processes between atoms, molecules, and cells threatened some \r\nof the central dogmas of the sciences. Although \r\nNorbert Wiener popularized some aspects of the teleological approach \r\nto regulatory systems in the 1950s, and saw analogies between the teleological \r\nmachines and the way the brain functions in Parkinson's disease, by \r\n1950 the digital approach to information processing, storage, and transmission \r\nwas displacing analog devices in computation and engineering, and was \r\ncompatible with theories of intelligence, such as neo-Kantianism, that \r\nbelieved that human intelligence can be defined precisely, in terms \r\nof discrete rules and operations.  Field thinking in embryology, \r\ncancer theory, psychology, and other sciences effectively disappeared--or \r\nwas disappeared, for ideological reasons. Wiener's \r\ngoal-directed machines, like Anokhin's functional systems, worked in \r\nspace and time, and the idea of steering or guidance assumes a context \r\nof time and space in which the adjustments or adaptations are made. \r\nAnalog computers and control systems in various ways involved formal \r\nparallels with reality. The components of the system, like reality, \r\noccupied space and time. Digital \r\ncomputers, with their different history and functions, for example their \r\nuse for creating or breaking military codes, didn't intrinsically model \r\nreality in any way. Information had to be encoded and processed by systems \r\nof definitions. A sequence of binary digits has meaning only in terms \r\nof someone's arbitrary definitions. Parallel \r\nwith the development of electronic digital computing machines, binary \r\ndigital theories of brain function were being developed, by people who \r\nsubscribed to views of knowledge very different from those of Anokhin \r\nand Wiener. (Anokhin argued against the idea that nerves use a simple \r\nbinary code.) These computer models of intelligence justify educational \r\npractices based on authoritative knowledge and conditioned (arbitrary) \r\nreflexes. Neo-Kantianism has been the dominant academic philosophy in \r\nthe U.S., turning philosophy into epistemology to exclude ontology. \r\n\"Operationism\" and logical positivism share with neo-Kantianism \r\nits elimination of ontology (concern with being itself). In \r\nthe 1960s, Ludwig von Bertalanffy developed a theory of systems, defining \r\na system as an arrayed multitude of inter-linked elements. Although \r\nit was intended as a description of biological systems, it reduced the \r\nteleological factors, needs and goals, to a kind of mechanical inner \r\nprogram, such as regulatory genes. Following old modes of thought, \r\nsome called this orderliness of life 'purposiveness' and sought for \r\nthe 'purpose' of an organ or function. However, in the concept of a \r\n'purpose' a desiring or intending of the goal always appeared to be \r\ninvolved--the type of idea to which the natural scientist is justly \r\nunsympathetic (von Bertalanffy). His \r\nsystem theory was highly compatible with programmed digital computers, \r\nthat could define the interactions of elements, but unlike Anokhin's \r\ndefinition of functional systems, it lacked a pattern-forming mechanism. \r\nIn Anokhin's view, the system is formed by seeking its goal, and perceiving \r\nits progress toward the goal. Carl \r\nRogers' approach to person-centered processes recognized that the interacting \r\ntherapist and client or teacher and student were a formative system, \r\nrather than just an occasion for one to inform the other. In \r\nthe Synectics group, they learned to identify the types of deeply involved \r\ninteraction that would lead to the best inventions. As in Anokhin's \r\nfunctional systems, resources are mobilized or generated as they are \r\nneeded. Like Anokhin, they showed that the process of creating something \r\nnew can be understood and controlled. Every \r\nmeaningful interaction involves formative systems. Stimulation \r\nof sensory nerves can cause cells to move into the stimulated area, \r\ncausing the organ to grow. Environmental enrichment causes brains to \r\nbecome larger, and to metabolize at a higher rate. All of these processes, \r\nfrom the level of energy production to the birth of new cells and the \r\ncreation of new patterns in the brain, are called up in the formation \r\nof a functional system. The \r\nstudies of organismic coherence by Mae-Wan Ho and Fritz Popp appear \r\nto support the idea that even the alignment of molecules in cells is \r\nresponsive to the state of the entire organism. The \r\nreason this seems implausible to most biologists is that cells are commonly \r\nstill seen as analogous to little test-tubes in which chemical processes \r\noccur as the result of random collisions between molecules floating \r\nin water.  But Sidney Bernhard's study of glycolysis showed that \r\nthe reactive sugar molecules are passed individually from one enzyme \r\nto the next, in an orderly manner. In \r\nthis system, the flow of energy, a series of oxidations and reductions \r\nchanging glucose into other substances, effectively pulls the \r\nmolecules through the system, contributing to order on a molecular level. \r\nFunction creates structure, which supports function. Self-regulating \r\nsystems are self-ordering systems. When a person is allowed to function \r\nfreely as a goal-directed, questioning system, the formation of patterns \r\nin the brain will be spontaneous and appropriate, and orderly. Knowing \r\nis the ability to hold patterns in awareness. Knowledge, rather than \r\nbeing stored like money in the bank, is something that is regenerated, \r\nor generated, as we need it. When \r\nour own steering system is commandeered by the authorities, our patterns \r\nof knowledge will be compartmented, and arranged in a fixed pattern. \r\nThis kind of knowledge either deteriorates, or it seeks more of its \r\nown kind. While \r\nself-regulation and the generation of knowledge are pleasurable, having \r\nknowledge imposed isn't. Korzybski \r\nwas right in warning about the dangers of letting names become elements. \r\nThis perception led Paolo Freire to emphasize the educational importance \r\nof critically giving things their appropriate names, rather than just \r\nbanking the names given by an authority. To exist, humanly, \r\nis to name the world, to change it.Once named, the world in its \r\nturn reappears to the namers as a problem and requires of them a new \r\nnaming.Human beings are not built in silence, but in word, in work, \r\nin action-reflection. . . . to speak a true word is to transform \r\nthe world. 'Problem-posing' education, responding to the essence \r\nof consciousness--intentionality--rejects communiques and embodies communication \r\n(Freire, 1993). Having \r\nthe power to assign names is a source of power and wealth. The pharmaceutical \r\nindustry has been accused of inventing new diseases to sell new drugs \r\nfor treating them. Old definitions of cancer are hard to change, when \r\nthe medical profession has invested so much in treatments--radiation \r\nand cytotoxic chemotherapy--which conflict with newer biological understanding \r\nof cancer. The \r\nperson who is learning is critically interacting with both nature and \r\nculture, with practical issues and theories. Applying \r\nthis to practical problems of health and nutrition, a first step is \r\nto begin to think about which things are theories or deductions from \r\ntheories, which are habits, and which things are felt needs or appetites, \r\nand to get in the habit of watching processes or things--such as signs \r\nand symptoms--develop through time. With \r\npractice, people can begin to see themselves as functional systems in \r\ntheir main activities, such as eating, and to watch how their needs \r\ninfluence their actions, and what effects different ways of eating have \r\non their other functions, such as sleeping and working. Do appetites \r\ngovern the timing of meals and the choice of foods? How does the time \r\nof day or time of month affect appetites? People often watch for effects \r\nof foods, but usually only for a few minutes or hours after eating. \r\nSome foods can produce symptoms days after they were eaten, and the \r\nactivation of the digestive system by a recent meal can cause a reaction \r\nto something eaten previously. Our \r\ntraditional cultures, and advertising and schools give us definitions \r\nand expectations relating to foods and symptoms and physiology, and \r\nthey teach us to think of our bodies in terms of an immune system, \r\nendocrine system, digestive system, nervous system, \r\nand circulatory system, which are mainly anatomical concepts that \r\nare more useful to the drug companies than to the consumer of culture. \r\nBoth conventional and alternative approaches to medicine and health \r\nare likely to let those arbitrary ideas of systems cause them to overlook \r\nreal, but unnamed, processes. When \r\nthe organism is seen as a mosaic of parts, rather than as a system of \r\ndeveloping fields, medical treatments for one part, such as the circulatory \r\nsystem, are likely to cause problems in other systems, because \r\nthe parts being treated don't exist as such in the real organism, \r\nwith the result that the treatments are seldom biologically reasonable. Besides \r\nlearning to perceive one's own physiology and becoming aware of the \r\nprocesses of perceiving and knowing so that they can be improved, it's \r\nimportant to seek information to expand the interpretive framework, \r\nand to look for new contexts and implications. Reading \r\nwith a critical imagination is as important for science as it is for \r\nliterature or advertising. Good literature often opens expansive new \r\nways of seeing the world, and good science writing can do that too, \r\nbut too often scientific publications have ulterior motives, and should \r\nbe read the way advertising propaganda is read. Some \r\npublications now require authors to state their conflicts of interest \r\n(such as receiving money from a drug company while testing a drug), \r\nbut editors and publishers, who choose which studies will be published, \r\nseldom reveal their conflicts of interest. As Marcia Angell showed, \r\neditorial choices can turn statistical randomness into statistical significance. \r\nPrivate ownership of science journals permits control of their content. Besides \r\nbeing aware of the conflicts of interest and the frequent insignificance \r\nof statistical significance, it's possible to recognize some features \r\nof the style of argument which is often used in science propaganda. \r\nA deductive style, rather than a descriptive and inductive style is \r\nextremely common in technical writing, and it should always lead the \r\nreader to question the principle from which deductions are made. Membranes \r\nare made from Essential Fatty Acids, therefore those fatty acids are \r\nnutritionally essential. But cells can multiply in a culture medium \r\nthat provides no fats. In biology, the most popular principles \r\nare simply dogmatic beliefs about genes and membranes. In \r\nphysics, where testable inferences can be drawn from arbitrary assumptions \r\nor doctrines, predictions that may be made based on different assumptions \r\nare often ignored for ideological reasons. This ideological quality \r\nof physics can permeate the other sciences when they use reductionist \r\nexplanations. Korzybski \r\nfelt he was helping humanity to escape word magic and to advance \r\nto a mathematical view of the world. But the same processes that caused \r\npeople to confuse words with things can cause people to confuse \r\nmathematical descriptions with reality. Chaos \r\ntheory, which was a faddish excitement about the ability to generate \r\nunpredictable output from a simple rule (which could be endlessly repeated \r\nby a computer), has been suggested to explain many things in biology, \r\nincluding heart rate variability. It doesn't. Instead, it has probably \r\nhad a slightly harmful effect, by distracting attention from real biological \r\npattern- forming processes. Real \r\nsubstance can sometimes be modeled by descriptions of randomness, but \r\nsubstances at all levels have intrinsic pattern-forming tendencies, \r\nand context-dependent histories. Water, for example, has structure and \r\nstructural memory that can affect even simple chemical reactions, and \r\neven gases have internal complexities that are often ignored. Real observations \r\nshouldn't be displaced by theories. The ideal and identical atoms of \r\nthe reductionists are a crude fantasy, invented, more or less consciously, \r\nto serve their ideological purposes. One purpose has been to justify \r\ntheir abstract models of reality. A particularly noxious way of modeling \r\nreality has been based on the assumption of randomness, justifying a \r\nstatistical view of all things. The \r\nneo-Kantian philosophy that has dominated US universities for more than \r\na century argues that our senses (even when extended instrumentally) \r\nare limited, so our knowledge must be limited--we can only speak of \r\ntheories or interpretations, not of being. The world we see is, according \r\nto them, only an artifact of our senses. A popular example is that the \r\nflower a bee sees is different from the flower a human sees, because \r\nthe bee's eye is sensitive to ultraviolet light. (The triviality of \r\nthe example is shown by the fact that when a person's lens is removed \r\nbecause of a cataract, ultraviolet light becomes visible, because it \r\nis no longer blocked by the tissue that is many times thicker than a \r\nbee's lens.) There is a straw-man quality to their arguments against \r\nphilosophical realism and empirical science:No one claims that our senses deliver complete knowledge all at once. \r\nWhat the realists claim is that interacting with the world is an endless \r\nsource of valid knowledge. When \r\nreading science articles, or listening to lectures, and even while privately \r\nthinking about experiences, it can be useful to watch for the improper \r\nuse of assumptions. Our understanding has been shaped by the assumptions \r\nof our culture, and these assumptions present an attitude toward the \r\nnature of the world, in some cases even about the ontology that our \r\nphilosophers have said is beyond our reach. Evolution is shaped by \r\nrandom mutations, nuclear decay is random, the universe \r\nis expanding, entropy only increases, DNA controls inheritance, \r\nmembrane pumps keep cells alive, and all of the negative assumptions \r\nthat have for so long denied the systematic generation of order. Every \r\ncommunicative interaction is an opportunity for the discovery of new \r\nmeanings and potentials. =========== Aristotelian \r\nmotto: If the knower and the known form a functional system they are \r\nsubstantially the same. =========== REFERENCES P.K. \r\nAnokhin: 1975,The essays on physiology of functional systems. 1978,Philosophical aspects of the theory of functional systems. 1998,Cybernetics of functional systems: Selected works,Moscow, \r\nMedicine, 400 p., (in Russian).

        "chunk_html": "Intelligence and metabolism================================ Appropriate \r\nstimulation is an essential part of the developmental process. Inappropriate \r\nstimulation is a stress that deforms the process of growth. Mediators \r\nof stress, such as serotonin, can cause persistent distortions of physiology \r\nand behavior. Education \r\ncan either activate or suppress mental energy. If it is mainly obedience \r\ntraining, it suppresses energy. If it creates social dislocations, it \r\ndisturbs mental and emotional energy. Stress \r\nearly in life can impair learning, cause aggressive or compulsive behavior, \r\nlearned helplessness, shyness, alcoholism, and other problems. Serotonin \r\nactivates the glucocorticoid system, which can produce brain atrophy. \r\nAntiserotonin agents protect against brain atrophy and many other effects \r\nof stress. The brain-protecting neurosteroids, including pregnenolone \r\nand progesterone, which are increased by some kinds of stimulation, \r\nare decreased by isolation stress, and in their absence, serotonin and \r\nthe glucocorticoids are relatively unopposed. Since \r\nexcess serotonin can cause thrombosis and vasospasms, and the excess \r\ncortisol resulting from hyperserotonemia can weaken blood vessels and \r\nthe immune system, a person's longevity is likely to be shortened if \r\nsomething doesn't intervene to alter the patterns induced by stress \r\nearly in life. ================================ Baroness \r\nBlatch: My Lords, the levels of achievement are well above the national \r\naverage of our own state schools. This \r\nis a school which attained 75 per cent A to C passes in 1998, and 63.9 \r\nper cent in 1999. Those figures are well above national averages. There \r\nis no truancy; and there is the highest possible level of parental satisfaction \r\nwith the school. When those parents are paying their money and know \r\nwhat they are paying for, who are we to take a different view about \r\nthe philosophy of education in a private school? Comment \r\nduring debate in House of Lords, June 30, 1999, on Chief Inspector of \r\nSchools Woodhead's threat to close Summerhill, a democratic school which \r\nhad been started in 1921. In \r\n1927, the government inspectors had recommended that 'all educationalists' \r\nshould come to Summerhill to see its 'invaluable' research, which demonstrated \r\nthat students' development is better when they regulate themselves and \r\nare not required to attend lessons. ================================ Having \r\nwritten about animal intelligence, and the ways in which it is similar \r\nto human intelligence, now I want those ideas to serve as a context \r\nfor thinking about human intelligence without many of the usual preconceptions. Intelligence \r\nis an interface between physiology and the environment, so it's necessary \r\nto think about each aspect in relation to the other. Things, both biochemical \r\nand social, that enhance intelligence enhance life itself, and vice \r\nversa. Psychologists \r\nhave tried to give their own definitions to words like idiot, imbecile, \r\nmoron, and genius, but they have just been refining the clichés of \r\nthe culture, in which dummy is one of the first words that kids \r\nin the U.S. learn. Many psychologists have tried to create culture-free \r\ntests of intelligence, making it clear that they believe in something \r\nlike innate animal intelligence, though they usually call it genetic \r\nintelligence. Other psychometrists have transcended not only biology \r\nbut even rationality, and have catalogued thepreferencesof people that they define as intelligent, and designed I.Q. tests \r\nbased on the selection of things that were preferred by intelligent \r\npeople. This behavior is remarkably similar to the psychometry \r\nof the general culture, in which smart people are those who do \r\nthings the right way. About \r\nthirty years ago, someone found that the speed with which the iris contracts \r\nin response to a flash of light corresponds very closely to the I.Q. \r\nmeasured by a psychologist using a standard intelligence test. The devices \r\nused to measure reaction time in drivers' education courses also give \r\na good indication of a person's intelligence, but so does measuring \r\ntheir heart rate, or taking their temperature. Colleges would probably \r\nbe embarrassed to admit students on the basis of their temperature (though \r\nthey commonly award scholarships on the basis of the ability to throw \r\na ball). Colleges, to the extent that they are serious about the business \r\nof education, are interested in the student's ability to master the \r\nculture. The \r\nway a person has learned during childhood can shape that person's manner \r\nof grasping the culture. To simply accelerate the learning of a standard \r\ncurriculum will increase that person's I.Q. on a conventional \r\ntest, but the important issue is whether it is really intelligent to \r\nlearn and to value the things taught in those curricula. Some educators \r\nsay that their purpose is to socialize and indoctrinate the students \r\ninto their discipline, others believe their purpose is to help their \r\nstudents to develop their minds. Both of these approaches may operate \r\nwithin the idea that the culture is something like a museum, and \r\nthat students should become curators of the collection, or of some part \r\nof it. If we see the culture metaphorically as a mixture of madhouse, \r\nprison, factory, and theater, the idea of developing the student's \r\nmind will suggest very different methods and different attitudes \r\ntoward the curriculum Even \r\nsophisticated people can fall into stereotyped thinking when they write \r\nabout issues of intelligence. For example, no one considers it a sign \r\nof genius when a slum kid is fluent in both Spanish and English, but \r\nwhen some of history's brightest people are discussed, the fact that \r\nthey learned classical Greek at an early age is always mentioned. No \r\none mentions whether they were competent in idiomatic Spanish. One \r\nof the old cultural stereotypes is that child prodigies always burn \r\nout, as if they were consuming a fixed amount of mental energy at \r\nan accelerated rate. (This idea of burn-out is isomorphic with the other \r\ncultural stereotypes relating aging to the rate of living, for \r\nexample that people with slow heart beats will live longer.) Some of \r\nthe men who have been considered as the world's brightest have, in fact, \r\ngone through a crisis of depression, and Terman's long-term study of \r\nbright people found that maladjustment did increase with I.Q., \r\nespecially among women. But the facts don't support the concept of burn-out \r\nat all. I think the facts reveal instead a deep flaw in our ideas of \r\neducation and professional knowledge. In a world \r\nrun by corporation executives, university presidents (football is \r\ncentral to the university's mission), congressmen, bankers, oilmen, \r\nand agency bureaucrats, people with the intelligence of an ant (a warm \r\nant) might seem outlandishly intelligent. This is because the benighted \r\nself-interest of the self-appointed ruling class recognizes that objective \r\nreality is always a threat to their interests. If people, for example, \r\nrealized that estrogen therapy and serotonin-active drugs and x-rays \r\nand nuclear power and atomic bomb tests were beneficial only to those \r\nwhose wealth and power derive from them, the whole system would lose \r\nstability. Feigned stupidity becomes real stupidity. But apart from \r\nideologically institutionalized stupidity, there are real variations \r\nin the ability to learn, to remember and to apply knowledge, and to \r\nsolve problems. These variations are generally metabolic differences, \r\nand so will change according to circumstances that affect metabolism. \r\nEveryday social experiences affect metabolism, stimulating and supporting \r\nsome kinds of brain activity, suppressing and punishing others. All \r\nof the activities in the child's environment are educational, in one \r\nway or another. Some \r\nof the famous prodigies of history illustrate the importance of ideology \r\nin the development of intellect. Family ideology, passing on the philosophical \r\norientations of parents and their friends, shapes the way the children \r\nare educated. Some \r\nof these family traditions can be traced by considering who the child's \r\ngodfather was.  Jeremy Bentham was John Stuart Mill's godfather, \r\nMill was Bertrand Russell's; Ralph Waldo Emerson was William James' \r\n\r\ngodfather, James was W. J. Sidis's. Willy Sidis was educated by his \r\nparents to demonstrate their theory of education, which grew out of \r\nthe philosophies of Emerson and James. His father, Boris Sidis, was \r\na pioneer in the study of hypnosis, and he believed that suggestion \r\ncould mobilize the mind's reserve energy. Willy learned several \r\nlanguages and advanced mathematics at an early age. After he graduated \r\nfrom Harvard at the age of 16, he tried teaching math at Rice Institute, \r\nbut he was displeased by the attitudes of his students and of the newspaper \r\nand magazine writers who made a profession of mocking him. He attended \r\nlaw school at Harvard, and would have been imprisoned as a conscientious \r\nobjector if the war hadn't ended. Antisemitism \r\nprobably played a role in his sense of isolation when he was at Harvard \r\nand Rice. In 1912 Henry Goddard, a pioneer in intelligence testing (and \r\nauthor ofThe Kallikak Family: A Study in the Heredity of Feeble- \r\nMindedness), administered intelligence tests to immigrants and \r\ndetermined that 83 percent of Jews and 87 percent of Russians were feeble-minded. \r\nBy the standards of the time, it was highly inappropriate for the child \r\nof extremely poor Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe to be so bright. Sidis \r\nhid from the press, and worked as a bookkeeper and clerk, while he studied \r\nand wrote. During his years of obscurity, he wrote books on philosophy \r\nand American history. Eventually, the journalists discovered him again, \r\nand after prolonged lawsuits against the magazines for invasion of privacy \r\nand slander, he died of a stroke at the age of 46. Sidis \r\nis probably the culture's favorite example of the child prodigy who \r\nburns out, but people (Robert Persig, Buckminster Fuller) who have read \r\nhis books have said favorable things about them. The journalists' emphasis \r\non the fact that Sidis never held a prestigious job nicely illustrates \r\ntheir cliché mentality: If you're so smart, why aren't you rich? \r\nBut throughout history, intelligent nonconformists have supported themselves \r\nas craft-workers or technicians--Socrates as a stone mason, Spinoza \r\nas a lens grinder, Blake as an engraver, Einstein as a patent examiner, \r\nfor example. In \r\nconventional schools (as in conventional society) 10,000 questions go \r\nunanswered, not only because a teacher with many students has no time \r\nto answer them, but also because most teachers wouldn't know most of \r\nthe answers. The \r\nparents of W. J. Sidis and J. S. Mill were remarkably well educated \r\npeople who, because they dissented from society's ideology, chose to \r\nspend much of their time educating their children. Whenever a question \r\nabout Euclidean geometry or Greek grammar occurred to the child, it \r\ncould be answered immediately. It was only natural that progress would \r\nbe fast, but there were more important differences. When \r\nquestions are answered, curiosity is rewarded, and the person is enlivened. \r\nIn school, when following instructions and conforming to a routine is \r\nthe main business, many questions must go unanswered, and curiosity \r\nis punished by the dulling emptiness of the routine. Some \r\nschools are worse than others. For example, slum children were given \r\nI.Q. tests when they started school, and each subsequent year, and their \r\nI.Q.s dropped with each year of school. In a stimulating environment, \r\nthe reverse can happen, the I.Q. can rise each year. Since the tests \r\naren't culture free, their scores reflected the material that \r\nthey were being taught, but they undoubtedly also reflected the increasing \r\nboredom and despair of the children in a bad school, or the increasing \r\nliveliness of the children in the stimulating environment. I \r\nhave spoken with people in recent years who still held the idea of a \r\nfixed genetic mental potential, who believe that poor children fall \r\nbehind because they are reaching their genetic limit. For them, \r\nthe I.Q. represents an index of intrinsic quality, and is as important \r\nas distinguishing between caviar and frogs' eggs. The rat research of \r\nMarion Diamond and others at the University of California, however, \r\nshowed that the structure, weight, and biochemistry of a rat's brain \r\nchanges, according to the amount of environmental stimulation and opportunity \r\nfor exploration. This improvement of brain structure and function is \r\npassed on to the next generation, giving it a head-start. It isn't likely \r\nthat rats are more disposed than humans to benefit from mental activity, \r\nand in the years since Diamond's research there have been many discoveries \r\nshowing that brains of all sorts complexify structurally and functionally \r\nin response to stimulation. Rats \r\nisolated in little boxes, generation after generation--the normal laboratory \r\nrats--were the standard, but now it's known that isolation is a stress \r\nthat alters brain chemistry and function. Willy Sidis and John Stuart Mill were being stimulated and allowed to \r\ndevelop in one direction, but they were being isolated from interaction \r\nwith their peers. When Mill was twenty he went into a depression, and \r\nlater he wrote that it was because he discovered that he was unable \r\ntofeel.He had developed only part of his personality. Bertrand \r\nRussell (1872-1970), orphaned at the age of four, went to live with \r\nhis grandmother, who chose not to send him to school, but provided tutors. \r\nHe didn't experience a sense of academic pressure, and was able to read \r\nwhatever he wanted in his late grandfather's library. He didn't realize \r\nthat he was unusually bright until he went to Cambridge. The unusual \r\nfreedom of his childhood must have contributed to his willingness to \r\nhold unpopular opinions. In 1916 he was fined, and in 1918 imprisoned \r\nfor 6 months, for opposing the war. In \r\n1927, Russell and his wife, Dora Black, started a school. He later wrote \r\nthat, although the average student at the school was very bright, an \r\nexceptionally bright student was likely to be ostracized by the less \r\nbright students. He commented on the harm done to the brightest students \r\nby their social isolation, probably thinking about his own education \r\nin relative isolation. A psychologist (Leta Hollingworth, 1942) has \r\nmade similar observations about the isolation that can be produced by \r\na large difference of I.Q. She did a series of studies of very bright \r\nchildren, beginning in 1916, including working with some of them in \r\na program she designed in a New York public school. Her empathy allowed \r\nher to discover things that weren't apparent to her contemporaries. During \r\nthis time Lewis Terman was studying bright children, and wanted to disprove \r\nsome of the popular stereotypes about intelligent people, and to support \r\nhis ideology of white racial superiority. In 1922 he got a large grant, \r\nand sorted out about 1500 of the brightest children from a group of \r\n250,000 in California. He and his associates then monitored them for \r\nthe rest of their lives (described inGenetic Studies of Genius). \r\nHis work contradicted the stereotype of bright people as being sickly \r\nor frail, but, contrary to his expectation, there was an association \r\nbetween maladjustment and higher I.Q.; the incidence of neurotic fatigue, \r\nanxiety, and depression increased along with the I.Q. The least bright \r\nof his group were more successful in many ways than the most bright. \r\nHe didn't really confront the implications of this, though it seriously \r\nchallenged his belief in a simple genetic racial superiority of physique, \r\nintellect, and character. I.Q. \r\ntesting originated in a historical setting in which its purpose was \r\noften to establish a claim of racial superiority, or to justify sterilization \r\nor euthanasia, or to exclude immigrants. More recently, the tests \r\nhave been used to assign students to certain career paths. Because of \r\ntheir use by people in power to control others, the I.Q. tests have \r\nhelped to create misunderstanding of the nature of intelligence. A person's \r\nI.Q. now has very strong associations with the ideology of schooling \r\nas a road to financial success, rather than to enrichment of a shared \r\nmental life. If \r\na bad school resembles, on the intellectual level, a confining rat box, \r\nthe educational isolation of Mill, Russell, and Sidis was emotionally \r\nlimiting, almost like solitary confinement. Once when Willy Sidis was \r\narrested for marching in a May Day parade, his father was able to keep \r\nhim from going to prison, but Willy apparently would have preferred \r\nthe real prison to life with his parents. None \r\nof these three famous intellects was known for youthful playfulness, \r\nthough playfulness is a quality that's closely associated with intelligence \r\nin mammals and birds. (Russell, however, in middle age developed many \r\nnew interests, such as writing short stories, and had many new loves \r\neven in old age.) Stress early in life, such as isolation, reduces the \r\nplayfulness of experimental animals. Playfulness is contagious, but \r\nso is the inability to play. In \r\nschools like Summerhill, which was founded in 1921 by A. S. Neill, students \r\naren't required to attend classes when they would rather do something \r\nelse, but at graduation they usually do better on their standardized \r\nnational examinations than students who have dutifully attended classes \r\nfor years. For students, as for rats, freedom and variety are good for \r\nthe brain, and tedious conformity is harmful. When a school is very \r\ngood, it can spread a contagion of playfulness along with an interest \r\nin learning. An \r\nenvironment that fosters optimal intelligence will necessarily promote \r\nthe development of emotional health, and will almost certainly foster \r\ngood physical health and longevity, because no part of the physiological \r\nsystem can thrive at the expense of another part. And within the boundaries \r\nof life-enriching environments, there are infinite possibilities for \r\nvariety. There \r\nis a common belief in the rigidity of the adult nervous system, in analogy \r\nwith feral cats or dogs, that supposedly can't be tamed if they have \r\ngrown up without knowing humans. But people who have had the inclination \r\nto understand wild animals have found that, even when the animals have \r\nbeen captured as adults, they can become as sociable as if they had \r\ngrown up in domestication. The horse whisperer demonstrated this \r\nsort of empathetic approach to animals. Sometimes, these people have \r\na similar ability to communicate with people who are retarded, or autistic, \r\nor demented, but the professionalization of society has made it increasingly \r\nunlikely that people with the need for intuitive help will encounter \r\nsomeone who is able to give it. The closest psychology has come to professionally \r\nrecognizing the importance of empathy was in Carl Rogers' work, e.g.,Client-Centered Therapy. Rogers \r\nshowed that a sense of solidarity must exist between therapist and client \r\nfor the therapy to be helpful. A similar solidarity has to exist between \r\nteacher and student, for education to be successful. If ordinary family \r\nand social contacts could occur within such an atmosphere of mutual \r\nrespect, psychopathology (including learning difficulties) would be \r\nmuch less common. Although \r\nthree individuals don't prove an argument, I think the lives and situations \r\nof Sidis, Mill, and Russell are usefully symbolic. Sidis, who grew up \r\nunder intense pressure and social isolation and in extreme poverty, \r\ndied at the age of 46. Mill, who was educated mainly by his father, \r\nin secure financial circumstances, experienced social isolation and \r\nmoderate pressure, and lived about 20 years longer than Sidis did. Russell, \r\nwho grew up in the highest circles of the ruling class, experienced \r\nno pressure, and only the mild kind of social isolation that wasn't \r\nexceptional for his class. He lived to be 97. The \r\npsychopathology of social isolation has been studied in a variety of \r\nanimals, and many features are similar across species, including humans. \r\nAggression, helplessness, and reduced ability to learn are typically \r\nproduced in animals by social isolation, and it's clear that certain \r\nkinds of family environment produce the same conditions in children. \r\nSchools seldom help, and often hinder, recovery from such early experiences. Vital \r\nexhaustion, decreased slow wave sleep, and anger, which are associated \r\nwith the type A personality and with circulatory and heart disease, \r\nappear to have their origin in childhood experiences. Low income and \r\nfinancial insecurity are strongly associated with anger, sleep disturbances, \r\nand circulatory disease.  In animals stressed by social isolation, \r\nsimilar features emerge, under the influence of decreased neurosteroids, \r\nand increased serotonin and activity of the glucocorticoid system. The \r\nsmart drug culture has generally been thinking pharmaceutically \r\nrather than biologically. Behind that pharmaceutical orientation there \r\nis sometimes the idea that the individual just isn't trying hard enough, \r\nor doesn't have quite the right genes to excel mentally. Many stimulants--amphetamine and estrogen, for example--can increase \r\nalertness temporarily, but at the expense of long range damage. The \r\nfirst principle of stimulation should be to avoid a harmful activation \r\nof the catabolic stress hormones. Light, play, environmental variety \r\nand exploratory conversations stimulate the whole organism in an integral \r\nway, stimulating repair processes and developmental processes. Any \r\nchemical support for intelligence should take into account the mind-damaging \r\nstresses that our culture can impose, and provide defense against those. \r\nIn darkness and isolation, for example, the stress hormones increase, \r\nand the brain-protective steroids decrease. The memory improvement that \r\nresults from taking pregnenolone or thyroid (which is needed for synthesizing \r\npregnenolone from cholesterol) is the result of turning off the dulling \r\nand brain-dissolving stress hormones, allowing normal responsiveness \r\nto be restored. If \r\nwe know that rats nurtured in freedom, in an interesting environment, \r\ngrow more intelligent, then it would seem obvious that we should experiment \r\nwith similar approaches for children--if we are really interested in \r\nfostering intelligence. And since violence and mental dullness are created \r\nby the same social stresses, even the desire to reduce school violence \r\nmight force the society to make some improvements that will, as a side \r\neffect, foster intelligence.

Learned helplessness, \r\na behavioral depression caused by exposure to inescapable stress, is \r\nconsidered to be an animal model of human depressive disorder. Like \r\nhuman depression, learned helplessness has been associated with a defect \r\nin serotonergic function, but the nature of this relationship is not \r\nentirely clear. We have used in vivo microdialysis brain perfusion to \r\nmeasure serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) in extracellular space \r\nof medial frontal cortex in conscious, freely moving rats. Basal 5HT \r\nlevels in rats perfused before exposure to tail-shock stress did not \r\nthemselves correlate with subsequent learned helplessness behavior. \r\nHowever, 5HT release after stress showed a significant increase with \r\nhelpless behavior.These data support the hypothesis that a cortical \r\nserotonergic excess is causally related to the development of learned \r\nhelplessness. Pharmacol Biochem \r\nBehav 1994 Jul;48(3):671-6.Does learned helplessness induction by \r\nhaloperidol involve serotonin mediation?Petty F, Kramer G, Moeller \r\nM Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Dallas 75216. Learned helplessness \r\n(LH) is a behavioral depression following inescapable stress. Helpless \r\nbehavior was induced in naive rats by the dopamine D2 receptor blocker \r\nhaloperidol (HDL) in a dose-dependent manner, with the greatest effects \r\nseen at 20 mg/kg (IP). Rats were tested 24 h after injection. Haloperidol \r\n(IP) increased release of serotonin (5-HT) in medial prefrontal cortex \r\n(MPC) as measured by in vivo microdialysis. Perfusion of HDL through \r\nthe probe in MPC caused increased cortical 5-HT release, as did perfusion \r\nof both dopamine and the dopamine agonist apomorphine. Our previous \r\nwork found that increased 5-HT release in MPC correlates with the development \r\nof LH. The present work suggests that increased DA release in MPC, known \r\nto occur with both inescapable stress and with HDL, may play a necessary \r\nbut not sufficient role in the development of LH. Also, this suggests \r\nthat increased DA activity in MPC leads to increased 5-HT release in \r\nMPC and to subsequent behavioral depression. Arzneimittelforschung \r\n1975 Nov; 25(11):1737-44.

BACKGROUND: \r\nWe do not fully understand the mechanisms for neuronal damage following \r\ncerebral arterial occlusion by a thrombus that consists mainly of platelets. \r\nThe view that certain endogenous substances, such as glutamate, may \r\nalso contribute to neuronal injury is now reasonably well established. \r\nBlood platelets are known to contain and secrete a number of substances \r\nthat have been associated with neuronal dysfunction. Therefore, we hypothesize \r\nthat a high concentration (approximately several thousand-fold higher \r\nthan in plasma, in our estimation) of locally released platelet secretory \r\nproducts derived from the causative thrombus may contribute to neuronal \r\ninjury and promote reactive gliosis. SUMMARY OF COMMENT: We have recently \r\nbeen able to report some direct support for this concept. When organotypic \r\nspinal cord cultures were exposed to platelet and platelet products, \r\na significant reduction in the number and the size of the surviving \r\nneurons occurred in comparison with those in controls. We further observed \r\nthat serotonin, a major platelet product, has neurotoxic properties. \r\nThere may be other platelet components with similar effect.CONCLUSIONS: \r\nThe hypothesis of platelet-mediated neurotoxicity gains some support \r\nfrom these recent in vitro findings. The concept could provide a new \r\narea of research in stroke, both at the clinical and basic levels.

Results of a multicenter, multinational therapeutic \r\ntrial].Kamoun A, Delalleau B, Ozun M The classical biochemical \r\nhypothesis of depression posits a functional deficit in central neurotransmitter \r\nsystems particularly serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline. The major role \r\nsuggested for 5-HT in this theory led to the development of a large \r\nnumber of compounds which selectively inhibit 5-HT uptake. Numerous \r\nclinical trials have demonstrated the antidepressant efficacy of such \r\ntypes of serotoninergic agents, supporting 5-HT deficit as the main \r\norigin of depression.Therefore, everything seemed clear: depression \r\nwas caused by 5-HT deficit. Tianeptine is clearly active in classical \r\nanimal models predictive of antidepressant activity, and is also active \r\nin behavioral screening tests: it antagonizes isolation induced aggression \r\nin mice and behavioral despair in rats.Biochemical studies have \r\nrevealed that in contrast to classical tricyclic antidepressant,tianeptine stimulates 5-HT uptakein vivo in the rat brain. This somewhat surprising property was observed \r\nin the cortex and the hippocampus following both acute and chronic administrations. \r\nThis increase in 5-HT uptake has also been confirmed in rat platelets \r\nafter acute andchronic administrations. Moreover, in humans, a study \r\nin depressed patients demonstrated that tianeptine significantly increased \r\nplatelet 5-HT uptake after a single administration as well as after \r\n10 and 28 days of treatment. The antidepressant activity of tianeptine \r\nhas been evaluated in controlled studies versus reference antidepressants. \r\nAnother study aiming to compare the antidepressant efficacy of tianeptine \r\nversus placebo and versus imiporamine ispresented. 186 depressed \r\npatients were included in this trial. They presented with either Major \r\nDepression, single episode (24.6%) or Major Depression recurrent (66.8%) \r\nor Bipolar Disorder (depressed) (8.6%).

McEwen BS, Conrad CD, Kuroda Y, Frankfurt \r\nM, Magarinos AM, McKittrick C. Atrophy and dysfunction of the human \r\nhippocampus is a feature of aging in some individuals, and this dysfunction \r\npredicts later dementia. There is reason to believe that adrenal glucocorticoids \r\nmay contribute to these changes, since the elevations of glucocorticoids \r\nin Cushing's syndrome and during normal aging are associated with atrophy \r\nof the entire hippocampal formation in humans and are linked to deficits \r\nin short-term verbal memory. We have developed a model of stress-induced \r\natrophy of the hippocampus of rats at the cellular level, and we have \r\nbeen investigating underlying mechanisms in search of agents that will \r\nblock the atrophy. Repeated restraint stress in rats for 3 weeks causes \r\nchanges in the hippocampal formation that include suppression of 5-HT1A \r\nreceptor binding and atrophy of dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons, \r\nas well as impairment of initial learning of a radial arm maze task.Because serotonin is released by stressors and may play a role in the \r\nactions of stress on nerve cells, we investigated the actions of agents \r\nthat facilitate or inhibit serotonin reuptake.Tianeptine is known \r\nto enhance serotonin uptake, and we compared it with fluoxetine, an \r\ninhibitor of 5-HT reuptake, as well as with desipramine.Tianeptine \r\ntreatment (10 mg/kg/day) prevented the stress-induced atrophy of dendrites \r\nof CA3 pycamidal neurons,whereas neither fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day) \r\nnor desipramine (10 mg/kg/day) had any effect.Tianeptine treatment \r\nalso prevented the stress-induced impairment of radial maze learning.Becausecorticosterone- and stress-induced atrophy of CA3 dendrites \r\nis also blocked by phenytoin, an inhibitor of excitatory amino acid \r\nrelease and actions, these results suggest that serotonin released by \r\nstress or corticosterone may interact pre- or post-synaptically with \r\nglutamate released by stress or corticosterone, and that the final common \r\npath may involve interactive effects between serotonin and glutamate \r\nreceptors on the dendrites of CA3 neurons innervated by mossy fibers \r\nfrom the dentate gyrus. We discuss the implications of these findings \r\nfor treating cognitive impairments and the risk for dementia in the \r\nelderly. © Ray Peat Ph.D. 2009.

Variations of consciousness, such \r\nas dementia, depression, delusion, or insight, originality, curiosity \r\nhave to be understood biologically.To \r\nunderstand our ability to know and discover, I think it's valuable to \r\nconsider foolishness along with wisdom, since \"knowledge\" \r\n\r\nconsists of both. Scientists have been notorious for opposing new discoveries, \r\nbut the mental rigidity of old age is so general, and well known, that \r\nmany people have believed that it was caused by the death of brain cells. \r\nIndividual cells do tend to become less adaptive with aging, and metabolism \r\ngenerally slows down with aging, but even relatively young and mentally \r\nquick people are susceptible to losing their ability to understand new \r\nideas.I \r\nthink our use of language is both the means by which understanding can \r\nbe preserved, encapsulated, and disseminated, and a great impediment \r\nto understanding. At first, words are continuous with the intuitive \r\nframework in which they are learned, but they gradually become relatively \r\nindependent and abstract. Things can be learned without directly experiencing \r\nthem. Even though words gradually change through use, the simple fact \r\nthat they have a degree of dependability allows them to function even \r\nwhen there is no active thought. Uncritical listening is possible, and \r\nif a person can say something, it seems to be easy to believe that it's \r\ntrue. By the age of 25, our language has usually given us many assumptions \r\nabout the nature of the world.Verbal \r\nformulations of one sort are given up for new verbal formulations, in \r\nthe process called education. Sometimes graduate students seem to have \r\nlost all common sense. It's as if their hard-drive had been reformatted \r\nto allow their professors to download onto it. But common sense, usually, \r\nis just what Einstein called it, an accumulation of prejudices.Children \r\nlearn language so easily that many people have seriously believed that \r\na certain language was inherited by people of each ethnic group. Bilingual \r\npeople were thought to be intellectually inferior (though it turned \r\nout that bilingualism actually increases a person's mental abilities--possibly \r\nbecause of the brain development known to be produced by learning1.) \r\nEventually, people learned that the children of immigrants were as capable \r\nof learning the language of the new country as the native children were.Then, \r\nexplaining the mystery of language learning took a new form, that didn't \r\nseem foolish to most professional anthropologists and linguists. The \r\nfirst and most important step in the new theory was to declare that \r\nsimple learning theory was inadequate to explain the development of \r\nlanguage. Language developed, just as the silly racial theory had thought, \r\nout of our genetic endowment, except that what we inherited was now \r\nsaid to be a Universal Language, with its Universal Rules embedded in \r\nour chromosomes. Then, the speed with which children learn language \r\nwas to be explained as the \"innateness\" of all of the complex \r\nstuff of language, with only a few things needing to be actually learned--those \r\nminor details that distinguish English from Eskimo or Zapotec.Although \r\nthe phrase \"genetic epistemology\" was coined by Jean Piaget, \r\na major philosophical and scientific theme of the 20th century has been \r\nthe idea that the \"forms\" of knowledge, for perceiving space, \r\nor logical relations, or language patterns, are derived from our genes, \r\nand that they are somehow built into the arrangement of our brain cells \r\nso that we spontaneously think in certain ways, and don't have the capacity \r\nto transcend the nature of our inherited brain. In that view, children \r\nhave their own pre-logical way of thinking, and their thought (and language \r\ndevelopment) must proceed through certain stages, each governed by some \r\n\"structural\" process in the nervous system. The only thing \r\nwrong with the idea of innate knowledge is that people use it to tell \r\nus what we can't know, in other words, to rationalize stupidity. Of \r\ncourse, they wouldn't like to phrase it that way, because they consider \r\ntheir \"genetic epistemology of symbolic forms\" to be the essence \r\nand the totality of intelligence, and that people who allow their thoughts \r\nto be structured entirely by experience are just confused.Years \r\nago, I had been criticizing Noam Chomsky's theory of language so much, \r\nthat I thought I might have misjudged or inappropriately depreciated \r\nhis general attitude toward consciousness, so I asked him some questions \r\nabout the intelligence of animals. His response confirmed my view that \r\nhe subscribed to the most extreme form of \"genetic epistemology\":\"I \r\ndon't know whether there is a common animal ability to manipulate images \r\nand generalize. In fact, I doubt it very much. Thus the kind of \"generalization\" \r\nthat leads to knowledge of lanugage from sensory experience seems to \r\nme to involve principles such as those of universal grammar as an innate \r\nproperty, for reasons I have explained elsewhere, and I see no reason \r\nto believe that these principles underlie generalization in other animals. \r\nNor do I think that the kinds of generalization that lead a bird to \r\ngain knowledge of how to build a nest, or to sing its song, or to orient \r\nitself spatially, are necessarily part of the human ability to generalize.\"All \r\nof the textbooks that I have seen that discuss the issue of animal intelligence \r\nhave taken a position like that of Chomsky--that any knowledge animals \r\nhave is either rigidly instinctual, or else is just a set of movements \r\nthat have been mechanically learned. In other words, there isn't anything \r\nintelligent about the complex things that animals may do. Konrad Lorenz \r\nand the ethologists explained animal behavior in terms of chains of \r\nreflexes that are \"triggered\" by certain sensations or perceptions. \r\nThis claim that animals' behavior just consists of mechanical chains \r\nof reflexes strictly follows Descartes' doctrine, and Chomsky has consistently \r\nacknowledged that his theory is Cartesian. The claim that children have \r\ntheir own non-logical way of understanding things is very similar to \r\nthe doctrine about animals, in the way it limits real rational understanding \r\nto adult human beings.The \r\nawareness of young animals is particularly impressive to me, because \r\nwe know the short time they have had in which to learn about the world. \r\nAny instance in which a young animal understands a completely novel \r\nsituation, in a way that is fully adequate and workable, demonstrates \r\nthat it is capable of intellectual generalization.Beyond \r\nthat, I think animal inventiveness can teach us about our own capacity \r\nfor inventiveness, which both the genetic and the behaviorist theories \r\nof knowledge totally fail to explain.Spiders that \r\nbuild architecturally beautiful webs have been favorite subjects for \r\ntheorizing about the instinctive mechanisms of behavior. When spiders \r\nwere sent up on an orbiting satellite, they were in a situation that \r\nspiders had never experienced before. Spiders have always taken advantage \r\nof gravity for building their webs, and at first, the orbiting spiders \r\nmade strange little muddled arrangements of filaments, but after just \r\na few attempts, they were able to build exactly the same sort of elegant \r\nstructures that spiders normally build. (My interpretation of that was \r\nthat spiders may be more intelligent than most neurobiologists.)Nesting \r\nbirds often swoop at people or animals who get too close to their nest. \r\nEarly last summer, I had noticed some blue jays that seemed to be acting \r\ndefensive whenever I went into one part of the yard. On a very hot day \r\nat the end of summer, a couple of plump jays were squawking and apparently \r\ntrying to get my attention while I was watering the front yard, and \r\nI idly wondered why they would be acting that way so late in the year. \r\nI had gone around the house to water things in the back yard, and the \r\nbirds came over the house, and were still squawking, and trying to get \r\nmy attention. I realized that their excitement didn't have anything \r\nto do with their nest, and looking more carefully, I saw that they were \r\nyoung birds.  As it dawned on me that they were interested in the \r\nwater squirting out of the hose, I aimed the stream up towards them, \r\nand they got as close to it as they could. Since the force of the stream \r\nmight have hurt them, I put on a nozzle that made a finer spray, and \r\nthe birds immediately came down to the lowest tip of the branch, where \r\nthey could get the full force of the mist, holding out their wings, \r\nand leaning into the spray so that it ruffled their breast feathers.  \r\nTheir persistence had finally paid off when they got me to understand \r\nwhat they wanted, and they were enjoying the cool water. As new young \r\nbirds, I don't know how they understood hoses and squirting water, but \r\nit was clear that they recognized me as a potentially intelligent being \r\nwith whom they could communicate.For \r\na person, that wouldn't have seemed like a tremendously inventive response \r\nto the hot weather, but for young birds that hadn't been out of the \r\nnest for long, it made it clear to me that there is more inventive intelligence \r\nin the world than is apparent to most academic psychologists and ethologists.Early \r\nporpoise researchers were surprised when a porpoise understood a sequence \r\nin which one tone was followed by two, and then by three, and answered \r\nby producing a series of four tones.  The porpoise had discovered \r\nthat people knew how to count.Experiments \r\nwith bees show the same sort of understanding of numbers and intentions. \r\nAn experimenter set out dishes of honey in a sequence, doubling the \r\ndistance each time. After the first three dishes had been found by scouts, \r\nthe bees showed up at the fourth location before the honey arrived, \r\nextrapolating from the experimenter's previous behavior and inferring \r\nhis intentions.Once \r\nI noticed that an ant seemed to be dozing at the base of every maple \r\nleaf, and that there were several aphids on each leaf. I was getting \r\nvery close, trying to understand why the ant was sitting so quietly. \r\nApparently my odor gave the ant a start, and he leaped into activity, \r\nracing up the leaf, and giving each aphid a tap as he passed. When he \r\nhad reached the end of the leaf and had touched every aphid, his agitation \r\nsuddenly disappeared, and he returned to his spot at the base of the \r\nleaf. Although I knew that ants could count very well, as demonstrated \r\nby experiments in which an ant had to describe a complex route to a \r\ndish of honey, it was the apparent emotion that interested me. It reminded \r\nme of the hostess who counted her dishes before the guests left.When \r\nthe brains of such different kinds of animal work in such similar ways, \r\nin situations that contain many new components, I don't think it's possible \r\nto conclude anything except that intelligence is a common property of \r\nanimals, and that it comprises \"generalization\" and much more.  \r\nIt's obvious that they grasp the situation in a realistic way. The situation \r\nhas structured their awareness.  Some people might say that they \r\nhave \"modeled the situation in their mind,\" but it's enough \r\nto say that they understand what's going on. With that understanding, \r\nmotivations and intentions form part of the perception, since the situation \r\nis a developing process. Ordinarily, we say that we \"infer\" \r\n\r\nmotivations and intentions and \"deduce\" probable outcomes, \r\nbut that implies that the situation is static, rather than continuous \r\nwith its origin and outcome. In reality, these understandings and expectations \r\nare part of the direct perception. It isn't a matter of \"intelligence\" \r\noperating upon \"sensations,\" but of intelligence inhering \r\nin the grasping of the situation. (In Latin,intelligomeant \"I perceive.\" I suspect that a Roman might have perceived \r\nthe wordintelligensas being derived from roots such \r\nastele--from Greek, ortela,web, warp thread--andligo or lego, connoting the binding in or gathering of what \r\nis distant or extended.)This \r\nview of a generalized animal intelligence wouldn't seem strange, except \r\nthat the history of official western philosophy, the doctrine of genetic \r\ndeterminism in biology, and the habits that form with the rigid uses \r\nof language, have offered another way of looking at it. The simple intelligence \r\nof an animal would disrupt all of that important stuff, so it has become \r\nmandatory to dismiss all examples of intelligent behavior by animals \r\nas \"mere anthropomorphizing.\" Sadly, this has also meant that \r\nmost intelligent behavior by humans has also been dismissed.The \r\ncellular development of an organism used to be described as a process \r\nin which everything is predetermined by the genes, but the interactions \r\nbetween an embryo and its environment are now known to be crucial in \r\nshaping the process of maturation, so that the real organism (the phenotype) \r\ndoesn't necessarily reflect its genetic make-up (genotype); the term \r\n\"phenocopy\" acknowledges this process.London \r\ntaxi drivers were recently found to have an enlargement of part of the \r\nhippocampus, compared to the brains of other people, and the difference \r\nwas greater, in proportion to the time they had been driving taxis. \r\nTheir brains have been shaped by their activities.If \r\nthe brain's cellular anatomy is so radically affected by activity even \r\nin adulthood, then the concept of awareness as a process in which consciousness \r\ntakes its form from the situation shouldn't be problematic. If a bee \r\nand a porpoise can draw similar conclusions from similar experiences, \r\nthen the world is being grasped by both in an objective way.The \r\nenvironment shapes the organism's response, and the momentary response \r\ncontributes to the development of the supporting processes and apparatuses.  \r\nSo the ability to respond is the basic question. If the richly grasped \r\nsituation contains its own implications, there is no need for explaining \r\nthe ability to perceive those implications in terms of some prearranged \r\nneurological code, except for the ability to respond complexly and appropriately. \r\nAny specific interpretation or behavior which is predetermined is going \r\nto function as an impediment to understanding. Verbal formulations often \r\nhave the function of creating a stereotyped and inappropriate response.The \r\n\"genetic epistemologists\" confuse their own verbal interpretations \r\nwith the real ways that understanding develops, and when a child doesn't \r\nyet know all of the connotations of a specific word, the psychologist \r\nascribes a pre-logical brain function to the child.3 The similar failure \r\nto perceive and to communicate accounts for the foolish things ethologists \r\nhave said about animal intelligence.The \r\nprocess in which an organism responds to a situation is continuous with \r\nthe process of communication.  The organism understands that in \r\ncertain situations a response can be elicited, and so it acts accordingly.Communication \r\nis a response that is directed toward eliciting a response from another. \r\nThe idea that an animal might have an intention, or a desire to communicate \r\nor respond, has been obsessively denied by most official western philosophers, \r\nwho see that as a uniquely human quality, but some philosophers have \r\neven denied that quality to humans. For them, consciousness is a passive \r\nreceptacle for units of meaning and logic, like a mail bin at the post-office, \r\nwhere letters are received, sorted, and distributed. Maybe computers \r\nwork that way, but there is nothing in living substance that works like \r\nthat.Consciousness \r\nis participation, in the sense that there is a response of an organism \r\nto events. Even dreams and hallucinations have their implied reference \r\nto something real.If \r\na violin has been soaked in water, it will sound very odd when it's \r\nplayed. Its various parts won't resonate properly. Similarly, the living \r\nsubstance has to be in a particular state to resonate properly with \r\nits environment.People \r\nhave proposed that visual experience involves the luminescence of nerves \r\nin the optical system. Presumably, similar analogs of events could occur \r\nin various tissues when we are conscious of sounds, tastes, smells, \r\netc. But whether or not our auditory nerves are singing when we experience \r\nmusic, no one questions the existence of some sort of responsive activity \r\nwhen we are being conscious of something. Activating certain brain areas \r\nwill make us conscious of certain things, and that activation can be \r\na response to sensory nerve impulses, or to brain chemicals produced \r\nin dreaming or drug-induced hallucinations, or to electrical stimulation, \r\nor to the act of remembering.The \r\nhistory of the prefrontal leukotomy or lobotomy, in which undesirable \r\nbehaviors were surgically removed, was closely associated with the development \r\nof surgical treatments for epilepsy.Natalya \r\nBekhtereva was exploring alternative treatments for epilepsy, implanting \r\nfine wire electrodes into the abnormal parts of the brain, and surrounding \r\nareas, to discover the nature of the electrical events that were associated \r\nwith the seizures. In the process, she discovered that meanings and \r\nintentions corresponded to particular electrical patterns. She found \r\nthat giving certain kinds of stimulation to healthy parts of the brain \r\ncould stimulate the development of ways of functioning that by-passed \r\nthe seizure-prone parts of the brain. Extending this, seeing that creating \r\nnew patterns of nervous activity could overcome sickness, she proposed \r\nthat creativity, the activation of the brain in new ways, would itself \r\nbe therapeutic. Some people, such as Stanislav Grof, advocated the therapeutic \r\nuse of LSD with a rationale that seems similar, for example to overcome \r\nchronic pain by changing its meaning, putting it into a different relation \r\nto the rest of experience. \"In general, psychedelic therapy seems \r\nto be most effective in the treatment of alcoholics, narcotic-drug addicts, \r\ndepressed patients, and individuals dying of cancer.\" 2 Since LSD \r\nshifts the balance away from serotonin dominance toward dopamine dominance, \r\nits effect can be to erase the habits of learned helplessness. Stress \r\nand pain also leave their residue in the endorphin system, and the anti-opiates \r\nsuch as naloxone can relieve depression, improve memory, and restore \r\ndisturbed pituitary functions, for example leading to the restoration \r\nof menstrual rhythms interrupted by stress or aging. The amazing speed \r\nwith which young animals can solve problems is undoubtedly a reflection \r\nof their metabolic vigor, and it is probably partly because they haven't \r\nyet experienced the paralysis that can result from repeated or prolonged \r\nand inescapable stress. Many of the factors responsible for the metabolic \r\nintensity of youth can be used therapeutically, even after dullness \r\nhas developed. The right balance of amino acids and carbohydrates, and \r\nthe avoidance of the antimetabolic unsaturated fatty acids, can make \r\na great difference in mental functioning, even though we still don't \r\nknow what the ideal formulas are.While \r\nchemical -- nutritional -- hormonal approaches can help to restore creativity, \r\nthe work of people like Bekhtereva shows that the exercise of creativity \r\ncan help to restore biochemical and physiological systems to more normal \r\nfunctioning. Learning new general principles or new languages can be \r\ncreatively restorative.NOTES AND REFERENCES1. \r\nProc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2000 Apr 11;97(8):4398-403.

Structural \r\nMRIs of the brains of humans with extensive navigation experience, licensed \r\nLondon taxi drivers, were analyzed and compared with those of control \r\nsubjects who did not drive taxis. The posterior hippocampi of taxi drivers \r\nwere significantly larger relative to those of control subjects. A more \r\nanterior hippocampal region was larger in control subjects than in taxi \r\ndrivers. Hippocampal volume correlated with the amount of time spent \r\nas a taxi driver (positively in the posterior and negatively in the \r\nanterior hippocampus). These data are in accordance with the idea that \r\nthe posterior hippocampus stores a spatial representation of the environment \r\nand can expand regionally to accommodate elaboration of this representation \r\nin people with a high dependence on navigational skills.

After the TES the protein content \r\nin the biological fluids tended to become normalized and the the range \r\nof low-molecular protein-peptide fractions changed. A high-performance \r\nliquid chromatography, bidimensional electrophoresis and thin-layer \r\nchromatography revealed about 5-6 factors of peptide nature with the \r\nmolecular mass less than 5000 daltons in the CSF and blood after the \r\nTES.

His answer is that the growth of knowledge \r\nis a progressive construction of logically embedded structures superseding \r\none another by a process of inclusion of lower less powerful logical \r\nmeans into higher and more powerful ones up to adulthood. Therefore, \r\nchildren's logic and modes of thinking are initially entirely different \r\nfrom those of adults.\"© Ray Peat Ph.D. 2009. All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com^^^Top^^^ Understanding consciousness \r\nis necessary for understanding life. Variations of consciousness, such \r\nas dementia, depression, delusion, or insight, originality, curiosity \r\nhave to be understood biologically.  To \r\nunderstand our ability to know and discover, I think it's valuable to \r\nconsider foolishness along with wisdom, since \"knowledge\" \r\n\r\nconsists of both. Scientists have been notorious for opposing new discoveries, \r\nbut the mental rigidity of old age is so general, and well known, that \r\nmany people have believed that it was caused by the death of brain cells. \r\nIndividual cells do tend to become less adaptive with aging, and metabolism \r\ngenerally slows down with aging, but even relatively young and mentally \r\nquick people are susceptible to losing their ability to understand new \r\nideas. I \r\nthink our use of language is both the means by which understanding can \r\nbe preserved, encapsulated, and disseminated, and a great impediment \r\nto understanding. At first, words are continuous with the intuitive \r\nframework in which they are learned, but they gradually become relatively \r\nindependent and abstract. Things can be learned without directly experiencing \r\nthem. Even though words gradually change through use, the simple fact \r\nthat they have a degree of dependability allows them to function even \r\nwhen there is no active thought. Uncritical listening is possible, and \r\nif a person can say something, it seems to be easy to believe that it's \r\ntrue. By the age of 25, our language has usually given us many assumptions \r\nabout the nature of the world. Verbal \r\nformulations of one sort are given up for new verbal formulations, in \r\nthe process called education. Sometimes graduate students seem to have \r\nlost all common sense. It's as if their hard-drive had been reformatted \r\nto allow their professors to download onto it. But common sense, usually, \r\nis just what Einstein called it, an accumulation of prejudices. Children \r\nlearn language so easily that many people have seriously believed that \r\na certain language was inherited by people of each ethnic group. Bilingual \r\npeople were thought to be intellectually inferior (though it turned \r\nout that bilingualism actually increases a person's mental abilities--possibly \r\nbecause of the brain development known to be produced by learning1.) \r\nEventually, people learned that the children of immigrants were as capable \r\nof learning the language of the new country as the native children were. Then, \r\nexplaining the mystery of language learning took a new form, that didn't \r\nseem foolish to most professional anthropologists and linguists. The \r\nfirst and most important step in the new theory was to declare that \r\nsimple learning theory was inadequate to explain the development of \r\nlanguage. Language developed, just as the silly racial theory had thought, \r\nout of our genetic endowment, except that what we inherited was now \r\nsaid to be a Universal Language, with its Universal Rules embedded in \r\nour chromosomes. Then, the speed with which children learn language \r\nwas to be explained as the \"innateness\" of all of the complex \r\nstuff of language, with only a few things needing to be actually learned--those \r\nminor details that distinguish English from Eskimo or Zapotec. Although \r\nthe phrase \"genetic epistemology\" was coined by Jean Piaget, \r\na major philosophical and scientific theme of the 20th century has been \r\nthe idea that the \"forms\" of knowledge, for perceiving space, \r\nor logical relations, or language patterns, are derived from our genes, \r\nand that they are somehow built into the arrangement of our brain cells \r\nso that we spontaneously think in certain ways, and don't have the capacity \r\nto transcend the nature of our inherited brain. In that view, children \r\nhave their own pre-logical way of thinking, and their thought (and language \r\ndevelopment) must proceed through certain stages, each governed by some \r\n\"structural\" process in the nervous system. The only thing \r\nwrong with the idea of innate knowledge is that people use it to tell \r\nus what we can't know, in other words, to rationalize stupidity. Of \r\ncourse, they wouldn't like to phrase it that way, because they consider \r\ntheir \"genetic epistemology of symbolic forms\" to be the essence \r\nand the totality of intelligence, and that people who allow their thoughts \r\nto be structured entirely by experience are just confused. Years \r\nago, I had been criticizing Noam Chomsky's theory of language so much, \r\nthat I thought I might have misjudged or inappropriately depreciated \r\nhis general attitude toward consciousness, so I asked him some questions \r\nabout the intelligence of animals. His response confirmed my view that \r\nhe subscribed to the most extreme form of \"genetic epistemology\": \"I \r\ndon't know whether there is a common animal ability to manipulate images \r\nand generalize. In fact, I doubt it very much. Thus the kind of \"generalization\" \r\nthat leads to knowledge of lanugage from sensory experience seems to \r\nme to involve principles such as those of universal grammar as an innate \r\nproperty, for reasons I have explained elsewhere, and I see no reason \r\nto believe that these principles underlie generalization in other animals. \r\nNor do I think that the kinds of generalization that lead a bird to \r\ngain knowledge of how to build a nest, or to sing its song, or to orient \r\nitself spatially, are necessarily part of the human ability to generalize.\" All \r\nof the textbooks that I have seen that discuss the issue of animal intelligence \r\nhave taken a position like that of Chomsky--that any knowledge animals \r\nhave is either rigidly instinctual, or else is just a set of movements \r\nthat have been mechanically learned. In other words, there isn't anything \r\nintelligent about the complex things that animals may do. Konrad Lorenz \r\nand the ethologists explained animal behavior in terms of chains of \r\nreflexes that are \"triggered\" by certain sensations or perceptions. \r\nThis claim that animals' behavior just consists of mechanical chains \r\nof reflexes strictly follows Descartes' doctrine, and Chomsky has consistently \r\nacknowledged that his theory is Cartesian. The claim that children have \r\ntheir own non-logical way of understanding things is very similar to \r\nthe doctrine about animals, in the way it limits real rational understanding \r\nto adult human beings. The \r\nawareness of young animals is particularly impressive to me, because \r\nwe know the short time they have had in which to learn about the world. \r\nAny instance in which a young animal understands a completely novel \r\nsituation, in a way that is fully adequate and workable, demonstrates \r\nthat it is capable of intellectual generalization. Beyond \r\nthat, I think animal inventiveness can teach us about our own capacity \r\nfor inventiveness, which both the genetic and the behaviorist theories \r\nof knowledge totally fail to explain. Spiders that \r\nbuild architecturally beautiful webs have been favorite subjects for \r\ntheorizing about the instinctive mechanisms of behavior. When spiders \r\nwere sent up on an orbiting satellite, they were in a situation that \r\nspiders had never experienced before. Spiders have always taken advantage \r\nof gravity for building their webs, and at first, the orbiting spiders \r\nmade strange little muddled arrangements of filaments, but after just \r\na few attempts, they were able to build exactly the same sort of elegant \r\nstructures that spiders normally build. (My interpretation of that was \r\nthat spiders may be more intelligent than most neurobiologists.) Nesting \r\nbirds often swoop at people or animals who get too close to their nest. \r\nEarly last summer, I had noticed some blue jays that seemed to be acting \r\ndefensive whenever I went into one part of the yard. On a very hot day \r\nat the end of summer, a couple of plump jays were squawking and apparently \r\ntrying to get my attention while I was watering the front yard, and \r\nI idly wondered why they would be acting that way so late in the year. \r\nI had gone around the house to water things in the back yard, and the \r\nbirds came over the house, and were still squawking, and trying to get \r\nmy attention. I realized that their excitement didn't have anything \r\nto do with their nest, and looking more carefully, I saw that they were \r\nyoung birds.  As it dawned on me that they were interested in the \r\nwater squirting out of the hose, I aimed the stream up towards them, \r\nand they got as close to it as they could. Since the force of the stream \r\nmight have hurt them, I put on a nozzle that made a finer spray, and \r\nthe birds immediately came down to the lowest tip of the branch, where \r\nthey could get the full force of the mist, holding out their wings, \r\nand leaning into the spray so that it ruffled their breast feathers.  \r\nTheir persistence had finally paid off when they got me to understand \r\nwhat they wanted, and they were enjoying the cool water. As new young \r\nbirds, I don't know how they understood hoses and squirting water, but \r\nit was clear that they recognized me as a potentially intelligent being \r\nwith whom they could communicate. For \r\na person, that wouldn't have seemed like a tremendously inventive response \r\nto the hot weather, but for young birds that hadn't been out of the \r\nnest for long, it made it clear to me that there is more inventive intelligence \r\nin the world than is apparent to most academic psychologists and ethologists. Early \r\nporpoise researchers were surprised when a porpoise understood a sequence \r\nin which one tone was followed by two, and then by three, and answered \r\nby producing a series of four tones.  The porpoise had discovered \r\nthat people knew how to count. Experiments \r\nwith bees show the same sort of understanding of numbers and intentions. \r\nAn experimenter set out dishes of honey in a sequence, doubling the \r\ndistance each time. After the first three dishes had been found by scouts, \r\nthe bees showed up at the fourth location before the honey arrived, \r\nextrapolating from the experimenter's previous behavior and inferring \r\nhis intentions. Once \r\nI noticed that an ant seemed to be dozing at the base of every maple \r\nleaf, and that there were several aphids on each leaf. I was getting \r\nvery close, trying to understand why the ant was sitting so quietly. \r\nApparently my odor gave the ant a start, and he leaped into activity, \r\nracing up the leaf, and giving each aphid a tap as he passed. When he \r\nhad reached the end of the leaf and had touched every aphid, his agitation \r\nsuddenly disappeared, and he returned to his spot at the base of the \r\nleaf. Although I knew that ants could count very well, as demonstrated \r\nby experiments in which an ant had to describe a complex route to a \r\ndish of honey, it was the apparent emotion that interested me. It reminded \r\nme of the hostess who counted her dishes before the guests left. When \r\nthe brains of such different kinds of animal work in such similar ways, \r\nin situations that contain many new components, I don't think it's possible \r\nto conclude anything except that intelligence is a common property of \r\nanimals, and that it comprises \"generalization\" and much more.  \r\nIt's obvious that they grasp the situation in a realistic way. The situation \r\nhas structured their awareness.  Some people might say that they \r\nhave \"modeled the situation in their mind,\" but it's enough \r\nto say that they understand what's going on. With that understanding, \r\nmotivations and intentions form part of the perception, since the situation \r\nis a developing process. Ordinarily, we say that we \"infer\" \r\n\r\nmotivations and intentions and \"deduce\" probable outcomes, \r\nbut that implies that the situation is static, rather than continuous \r\nwith its origin and outcome. In reality, these understandings and expectations \r\nare part of the direct perception. It isn't a matter of \"intelligence\" \r\noperating upon \"sensations,\" but of intelligence inhering \r\nin the grasping of the situation. (In Latin,intelligomeant \"I perceive.\" I suspect that a Roman might have perceived \r\nthe wordintelligensas being derived from roots such \r\nastele--from Greek, ortela,web, warp thread--andligo or lego, connoting the binding in or gathering of what \r\nis distant or extended.) This \r\nview of a generalized animal intelligence wouldn't seem strange, except \r\nthat the history of official western philosophy, the doctrine of genetic \r\ndeterminism in biology, and the habits that form with the rigid uses \r\nof language, have offered another way of looking at it. The simple intelligence \r\nof an animal would disrupt all of that important stuff, so it has become \r\nmandatory to dismiss all examples of intelligent behavior by animals \r\nas \"mere anthropomorphizing.\" Sadly, this has also meant that \r\nmost intelligent behavior by humans has also been dismissed. The \r\ncellular development of an organism used to be described as a process \r\nin which everything is predetermined by the genes, but the interactions \r\nbetween an embryo and its environment are now known to be crucial in \r\nshaping the process of maturation, so that the real organism (the phenotype) \r\ndoesn't necessarily reflect its genetic make-up (genotype); the term \r\n\"phenocopy\" acknowledges this process. London \r\ntaxi drivers were recently found to have an enlargement of part of the \r\nhippocampus, compared to the brains of other people, and the difference \r\nwas greater, in proportion to the time they had been driving taxis. \r\nTheir brains have been shaped by their activities. If \r\nthe brain's cellular anatomy is so radically affected by activity even \r\nin adulthood, then the concept of awareness as a process in which consciousness \r\ntakes its form from the situation shouldn't be problematic. If a bee \r\nand a porpoise can draw similar conclusions from similar experiences, \r\nthen the world is being grasped by both in an objective way. The \r\nenvironment shapes the organism's response, and the momentary response \r\ncontributes to the development of the supporting processes and apparatuses.  \r\nSo the ability to respond is the basic question. If the richly grasped \r\nsituation contains its own implications, there is no need for explaining \r\nthe ability to perceive those implications in terms of some prearranged \r\nneurological code, except for the ability to respond complexly and appropriately. \r\nAny specific interpretation or behavior which is predetermined is going \r\nto function as an impediment to understanding. Verbal formulations often \r\nhave the function of creating a stereotyped and inappropriate response. The \r\n\"genetic epistemologists\" confuse their own verbal interpretations \r\nwith the real ways that understanding develops, and when a child doesn't \r\nyet know all of the connotations of a specific word, the psychologist \r\nascribes a pre-logical brain function to the child.3 The similar failure \r\nto perceive and to communicate accounts for the foolish things ethologists \r\nhave said about animal intelligence. The \r\nprocess in which an organism responds to a situation is continuous with \r\nthe process of communication.  The organism understands that in \r\ncertain situations a response can be elicited, and so it acts accordingly. Communication \r\nis a response that is directed toward eliciting a response from another. \r\nThe idea that an animal might have an intention, or a desire to communicate \r\nor respond, has been obsessively denied by most official western philosophers, \r\nwho see that as a uniquely human quality, but some philosophers have \r\neven denied that quality to humans. For them, consciousness is a passive \r\nreceptacle for units of meaning and logic, like a mail bin at the post-office, \r\nwhere letters are received, sorted, and distributed. Maybe computers \r\nwork that way, but there is nothing in living substance that works like \r\nthat. Consciousness \r\nis participation, in the sense that there is a response of an organism \r\nto events. Even dreams and hallucinations have their implied reference \r\nto something real. If \r\na violin has been soaked in water, it will sound very odd when it's \r\nplayed. Its various parts won't resonate properly. Similarly, the living \r\nsubstance has to be in a particular state to resonate properly with \r\nits environment. People \r\nhave proposed that visual experience involves the luminescence of nerves \r\nin the optical system. Presumably, similar analogs of events could occur \r\nin various tissues when we are conscious of sounds, tastes, smells, \r\netc. But whether or not our auditory nerves are singing when we experience \r\nmusic, no one questions the existence of some sort of responsive activity \r\nwhen we are being conscious of something. Activating certain brain areas \r\nwill make us conscious of certain things, and that activation can be \r\na response to sensory nerve impulses, or to brain chemicals produced \r\nin dreaming or drug-induced hallucinations, or to electrical stimulation, \r\nor to the act of remembering. The \r\nhistory of the prefrontal leukotomy or lobotomy, in which undesirable \r\nbehaviors were surgically removed, was closely associated with the development \r\nof surgical treatments for epilepsy. Natalya \r\nBekhtereva was exploring alternative treatments for epilepsy, implanting \r\nfine wire electrodes into the abnormal parts of the brain, and surrounding \r\nareas, to discover the nature of the electrical events that were associated \r\nwith the seizures. In the process, she discovered that meanings and \r\nintentions corresponded to particular electrical patterns. She found \r\nthat giving certain kinds of stimulation to healthy parts of the brain \r\ncould stimulate the development of ways of functioning that by-passed \r\nthe seizure-prone parts of the brain. Extending this, seeing that creating \r\nnew patterns of nervous activity could overcome sickness, she proposed \r\nthat creativity, the activation of the brain in new ways, would itself \r\nbe therapeutic. Some people, such as Stanislav Grof, advocated the therapeutic \r\nuse of LSD with a rationale that seems similar, for example to overcome \r\nchronic pain by changing its meaning, putting it into a different relation \r\nto the rest of experience. \"In general, psychedelic therapy seems \r\nto be most effective in the treatment of alcoholics, narcotic-drug addicts, \r\ndepressed patients, and individuals dying of cancer.\" 2 Since LSD \r\nshifts the balance away from serotonin dominance toward dopamine dominance, \r\nits effect can be to erase the habits of learned helplessness. Stress \r\nand pain also leave their residue in the endorphin system, and the anti-opiates \r\nsuch as naloxone can relieve depression, improve memory, and restore \r\ndisturbed pituitary functions, for example leading to the restoration \r\nof menstrual rhythms interrupted by stress or aging. The amazing speed \r\nwith which young animals can solve problems is undoubtedly a reflection \r\nof their metabolic vigor, and it is probably partly because they haven't \r\nyet experienced the paralysis that can result from repeated or prolonged \r\nand inescapable stress. Many of the factors responsible for the metabolic \r\nintensity of youth can be used therapeutically, even after dullness \r\nhas developed. The right balance of amino acids and carbohydrates, and \r\nthe avoidance of the antimetabolic unsaturated fatty acids, can make \r\na great difference in mental functioning, even though we still don't \r\nknow what the ideal formulas are. While \r\nchemical -- nutritional -- hormonal approaches can help to restore creativity, \r\nthe work of people like Bekhtereva shows that the exercise of creativity \r\ncan help to restore biochemical and physiological systems to more normal \r\nfunctioning. Learning new general principles or new languages can be \r\ncreatively restorative. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1. \r\nProc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2000 Apr 11;97(8):4398-403.

Structural \r\nMRIs of the brains of humans with extensive navigation experience, licensed \r\nLondon taxi drivers, were analyzed and compared with those of control \r\nsubjects who did not drive taxis. The posterior hippocampi of taxi drivers \r\nwere significantly larger relative to those of control subjects. A more \r\nanterior hippocampal region was larger in control subjects than in taxi \r\ndrivers.

        "chunk_html": "Lactate vs. CO2 in wounds, sickness, and aging; the other approach to cancer=========================================== GLOSSARY Aerobic \r\nglycolysis,the conversion of glucose to lactic acid even in the \r\npresence of oxygen. The presence of oxygen normally restrains glycolysis \r\nso that glucose is converted to carbon dioxide instead of lactic acid. Anaerobic \r\nglycolysis,the increased conversion of glucose to lactic acid when \r\nthe supply of oxygen isn't sufficient, which is a normal event during \r\nintense muscle action. \"Warburg \r\nEffect\"refers to Otto Warburg's observation that cancer cells \r\nproduce lactic acid even in the presence of adequate oxygen. Cancer \r\ncells don't \"live on glucose,\" since they are highly adapted \r\nto survive on protein and fats. Pasteur \r\nEffect,the normal response of cells to restrain glycolysis in the \r\npresence of adequate oxygen. Crabtree \r\nEffect,observed originally in yeast, refers to the inhibition of \r\nrespiration in the presence of glucose. This occurs in cancers (e.g., \r\nMiralpeix, et al., 1990) and in rapidly proliferating normal cells (e.g., \r\nGuppy, et al., 1993). \"Cancer \r\nmetabolism\"or stress metabolism typically involves an excess \r\nof the adaptive hormones, resulting from an imbalance of the demands \r\nmade on the organism and the resources available to the organism. Excessive \r\nstimulation depletes glucose and produces lactic acid, and causes cortisol \r\nto increase, causing a shift to the consumption of fat and protein rather \r\nthan glucose. Increased cortisol activates the Randle effect (the inhibition \r\nof glucose oxidation by free fatty acids), accelerates the breakdown \r\nof protein into amino acids, and activates the enzyme fatty acid synthase, \r\nwhich produces fatty acids from amino acids and pyruvate, to be oxidized \r\nin a \"futile cycle,\" producing heat, and increasing the liberation \r\nof ammonia from the amino acids. Ammonia suppresses respiratory, and \r\nstimulates glycolytic, activity. =========================================== The \r\npresence of lactic acid in our tissues is very meaningful, but it is \r\nnormally treated as only an indicator, rather than as a cause, of biological \r\nproblems. Its presence in rosacea, arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, \r\nneurological diseases and cancer has been recognized, and recently it \r\nis being recognized that suppressing it can be curative, after fifty \r\nyears of denial. The \r\ninfluence of politics on science is so profound that neither historians \r\nnor scientists often care to consider it honestly and in depth. From \r\nthe 19th century until the second quarter of the 20th century, cancer \r\nwas investigated mainly as a metabolic problem. This work, understanding \r\nthe basic chemistry of metabolism, was culminating in the 1920s in the \r\nwork of Otto Warburg and Albert Szent-Gyorgyi on respiration. Warburg \r\ndemonstrated as early as 1920 that a respiratory defect, causing aerobic \r\nglycolysis, i.e., the production of lactic acid even in the presence \r\nof oxygen, was an essential feature of cancer. (The formation of lactic \r\nacid is normal and adaptive when the supply of oxygen isn't adequate \r\nto meet energy demands, for example when running.) Many \r\npeople recognized that this was likely to be the key to the \"cancer \r\nproblem.\" But in the US, several factors came together to block \r\nthis line of investigation. The \r\nworld wars contributed to the isolation of German scientists, and Warburg, \r\nof the famous Jewish banking family, continued his work in Germany with \r\nthe support of the government, despite his open opposition to Nazism. \r\nIn the years after the war, nothing positive could be said in the US \r\nabout his work on cancer. The \r\nmetabolic interpretation of disease that had been making progress for \r\nseveral decades was suddenly submerged when government research financing \r\nbegan concentrating on genetic and viral interpretations of disease. If \r\nan apparently non-infectious disease couldn't be explained on the basis \r\nof an inherited tendency---insanity, epilepsy, diabetes, toxemia of \r\npregnancy, and cancer, for example---then genetic changes occurring \r\nin the individual, as a result of chance or a virus, were invoked. Nutrition \r\nand other conditions of life were until fairly recently said to have \r\nno influence on health if the person consumed sufficient calories and \r\na minimum amount of the essential vitamins, minerals, and protein. The \r\ncult of genetic determinism was so powerful that it wasn't affected \r\nby the facts. In \r\n1932, a pediatrician, Alexis Hartmann (with M. Senn) in St. Louis, injected \r\nintravenously a solution of sodium lactate into patients with metabolic \r\nacidosis, and several of them survived---despite the fact that some \r\nof them were already suffering from an excess of lactate. The subsequent \r\nwidespread use of lactate solutions in hospitals has contributed to \r\nthe general denial of its toxicity. Hartmann \r\nand Senn used racemic lactate, that is, a mixture of D-lactate and L-lactate. \r\nOur own tissues produce mostly L-lactate, but they can produce small \r\namounts of D-lactate; larger amounts are produced by diabetics. Intestinal \r\nbacteria can produce large amounts of it, and it has many toxic effects. \r\nMethylglyoxal can be formed from either form of lactate, and it is an \r\nimportant factor in the glycation of proteins. It can also be formed \r\nfrom MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation. Protein glycation is an important \r\nfactor in diabetes and aging, but glucose, rather than lactate and polyunsaturated \r\nfats, is commonly said to be the cause. About \r\n50 years ago, lactate was known to induce the formation of new blood \r\nvessels, and for a much longer time it has been known to cause vasodilation \r\nand edema. In 1968, it was shown to stimulate collagen synthesis. Normally, \r\ncollagen synthesis and neovascularization are caused by lack of oxygen, \r\nbut lactate can cause them to occur even in the presence of oxygen. \r\nMaintenance of a normal extracellular matrix is essential for normal \r\nfunctioning and cellular differentiation. Abnormally stimulated collagen \r\nsynthesis probably accelerates tumor growth (Rajkumar, et al., 2006). Nervous \r\nand hormonal factors can cause lactate to accumulate, even without prior \r\ndamage to the mitochondria (e.g., B. Levy, et al., 2003). Psychological, \r\nas well as physical, stress and overactivation of glutamate receptors \r\ncan cause harmful accumulation of lactate in the brain (Uehara, et al., \r\n2005). Rather than just being \"associated with\" tissue damage, \r\nlactate directly contributes to the damage, for example in the brain, \r\ncausing nerve cell loss by increasing the release of excitotoxic glutamate \r\n(Xiang, et al, 2004). When a panic reaction is produced by sodium lactate, \r\nthe reduction of protective neurosteroids appears to contribute to the \r\nexcitatory state (Eser, et al. 2006); this would make the brain more \r\nsusceptible to damage. Lactate increases blood viscosity, mimics stress, causes inflammation, \r\nand contributes to shock. Lactated Ringer's solution contributes to \r\nthe tissue damage caused by shock, when it's used to resuscitate shock \r\nvictims (Deree, et al., 2007, 2008): it contributes to the inflammatory \r\nprocesses associated with shock, unlike the use of hypertonic saline \r\nand other solutions. Lactate contributes to diabetes, inhibiting the \r\nability to oxidize glucose. It promotes endothelial cell migration and \r\nleakiness, with increased vascular permeability factor (VPF or vascular \r\nendothelial growth factor, VEGF) (Nagy, et al. 1985): this can lead \r\nto breakdown of the \"blood-brain barrier.\" In \r\nthe brain, lactate can cause nerve damage, increasing intracellular \r\nfat accumulation, chromatin clumping, and mitochondrial swelling (Norenberg, \r\net al., 1987). The \r\nlactate in peritoneal dialysis solution impairs differentiation and \r\nmaturation of (immune, monocyte derived) dendritic cells; according \r\nto the authors of the study, \"These findings have important implications \r\nfor the initiation of immune responses under high lactate conditions, \r\nsuch as those occurring within tumor tissues or after macrophage activation\"(Puig-Kröger, et al., 2003). Lactate \r\nalso causes macrophages and synovial fibroblasts to release PGE2, which \r\ncan contribute to inflammation and bone resorption (Dawes and Rushton, \r\n1994). This is the prostaglandin known to activate the formation of \r\nestrogen (Haffty, et al., 2008). Hartmann's \r\nlactated solution has been widely used in hospitals for resuscitation \r\nand for patients after heart surgery and other stressful procedures, \r\nbut until recently only a few people have objected to its use, and most \r\nof the objection has been to the use of racemic lactate, rather than \r\nto lactate itself. In recent years several studies have compared hypertonic \r\nsaline (lacking the minerals considered essential since Sydney Ringer \r\nformulated his solution around 1885), and have found it in some cases \r\nsuperior to the \"balanced\" lactate solution. Even hypertonic \r\nglucose, without minerals, has produced good results in some studies. A \r\nsolution containing a large amount of lactate has been used for peritoneal \r\ndialysis when there is kidney failure, but several studies have compared \r\nsolutions using bicarbonate instead of lactate, and found that they \r\ndon't cause the severe damage that always happened with the traditional \r\nsolution. While \r\nWarburg was investigating the roles of glycolysis and respiration in \r\ncancer,a physician with a background in chemistry, W.F. Koch, \r\nin Detroit, was showing that the ability to use oxygen made the difference \r\nbetween health and sickness, and that the cancer metabolism could be \r\ncorrected by restoring the efficient use of oxygen. He argued that a \r\nrespiratory defect was responsible for immunodeficiency, allergy, and \r\ndefective function of muscles, nerves, and secretory cells, as well \r\nas cancer. Koch's idea of cancer's metabolic cause and its curability \r\ndirectly challenged the doctrine of the genetic irreversibility of cancer \r\nthat was central to governmental and commercial medical commitments. Albert \r\nSzent-Gyorgyi respected Koch's work, and spent years investigating the \r\ninvolvement of the lactate metabolites, methylgyoxal and glyoxal, in \r\ncell physiology, but since the government's campaign against Koch was \r\nstill active when Szent-Gyorgyi came to the U.S., he worked out many \r\nof the implications of Koch's work relating to cellular oxidation without \r\nmentioning his name. Lactate \r\nformation from glucose is increased when anything interferes with respiratory \r\nenergy production, but lactate, through a variety of mechanisms, can \r\nitself suppress cellular respiration. (This has been called the Crabtree \r\neffect.) Lactate can also inhibit its own formation, slowing glycolysis. \r\nIn the healthy cell, the mitochondrion keeps glycolysis working by consuming \r\npyruvate and electrons (or \"hydrogens\") from NADH, keeping \r\nthe cell highly oxidized, with a ratio of NAD+/NADH of about 200. When \r\nthe mitochondrion's ability to consume pyruvate and NADH is limited, \r\nthe pyruvate itself accepts the hydrogen from NADH, forming lactic acid \r\nand NAD+ in the process. As long as lactate leaves the cell as fast \r\nas it forms, glycolysis will provide ATP to allow the cell to survive. \r\nOxygen and pyruvate are normally \"electron sinks,\" regenerating \r\nthe NAD+ needed to produce energy from glucose. But \r\nif too much lactate is present, slowing glycolytic production of ATP, \r\nthe cell with defective respiration will die unless an alternative electron \r\nsink is available. The synthesis of fatty acids is such a sink, if electrons \r\n(hydrogens) can be transferred from NADH to NADP+, forming NADPH, which \r\nis the reducing substance required for turning carbohydrates and pyruvate \r\nand amino acids into fats. This \r\ntransfer can be activated by the transhydrogenase enzymes in the mitochondria, \r\nand also by interactions of some dehydrogenase enzymes. The \r\nenzyme, fatty acid synthase (FAS), normally active in the liver and \r\nfat cells and in the estrogen-stimulated uterus, is highly active in \r\ncancers, and its activity is an inverse indicator of prognosis.  \r\nInhibiting it can cause cancer cells to die, so the pharmaceutical industry \r\nis looking for drugs that can safely inhibit it. This enzyme is closely \r\nassociated with the rate of cell proliferation, and its activity is \r\nincreased by both cortisol and estrogen. The \r\nfirst biochemical event when a cell responds to estrogen is the synthesis \r\nof fat. Estrogen can activate transhydrogenases, and early studies of \r\nestrogen's biological effects provided considerable evidence that its \r\nactions were the result of the steroid molecule's direct participation \r\nin hydrogen transfers, oxidations and reductions. E.V. Jensen's claim \r\nthat estrogen acts only through a \"receptor protein\" which \r\nactivated gene transcription was based on his experimental evidence \r\nindicating that estrogen doesn't participate in oxidation and reduction \r\nprocesses in the uterus, but subsequently his claim has turned out to \r\nbe false. Glycolysis \r\nis very inefficient for producing usable energy compared to the respiratory \r\nmetabolism of the mitochondria, and when lactate is carried to the liver, \r\nits conversion to glucose adds to the energy drain on the organism. The \r\nhypoglycemia and related events resulting from accelerated glycolysis \r\nprovide a stimulus for increased activity of the adaptive hormones, \r\nincluding cortisol. Cortisol helps to maintain blood sugar by increasing \r\nthe conversion of protein to amino acids, and mobilizing free fatty \r\nacids from fat stores. The free fatty acids inhibit the use of glucose, \r\nso the stress metabolism relies largely on the consumption of amino \r\nacids. This increases the formation of ammonia, yet the combination \r\nof glycolysis and fat oxidation provides less carbon dioxide, which \r\nis needed for the conversion of ammonia to urea. Ammonia stimulates \r\nthe formation of lactate, while carbon dioxide inhibits it. Starving \r\nan animal with a tumor increases the stress hormones, providing free \r\nfatty acids and amino acids, and accelerates the tumor's growth (Sauer \r\nand Dauchy, 1987); it's impossible to \"starve a tumor,\" by \r\nthe methods often used. Preventing the excessive breakdown of protein \r\nand reducing the release of fatty acids from fat cells would probably \r\ncause many cancer cells to die, despite the availability of glucose, \r\nbecause of lactate's toxic effects, combined with the energy deficit \r\ncaused by the respiratory defect that causes their aerobic glycolysis. \r\nRecently, the intrinsically high rate of cell death in tumors has been \r\nrecognized. The tumor is maintained and enlarged by the recruitment \r\nof \"stem cells.\" These cells normally would repair or regenerate \r\nthe tissue, but under the existing metabolic conditions, they fail to \r\ndifferentiate properly. The \r\nextracellular matrix in the tumor is abnormal, as well as the metabolites \r\nand signal substances being produced there, and the new cells fail to \r\nreceive the instructions needed to restore the normal functions to the \r\ndamaged tissue. These abnormal conditions can cause abnormal differentiation, \r\nand this cellular state is likely to involve chemical modification of \r\nproteins, including remodeling of the chromosomes through acetylation \r\nof the histones (Alam, et al., 2008; Suuronen, et al., 2006). The protein-protective \r\neffects of carbon dioxide are replaced by the protein-damaging effects \r\nof lactate and its metabolites. The \r\nability of lactic acid to displace carbon dioxide is probably involved \r\nin its effects on the blood clotting system. It contributes to disseminated \r\nintravascular coagulation and consumption coagulopathy, and increases \r\nthe tendency of red cells to aggregate, forming \"blood sludge,\" \r\nand makes red cells more rigid, increasing the viscosity of blood and \r\nimpairing circulation in the small vessels. (Schmid-Schönbein, 1981; \r\nKobayashi, et al., 2001; Martin, et al., 2002; Yamazaki, et al., 2006.) The \r\nfeatures of the stress metabolism include increases of stress hormones, \r\nlactate, ammonia, free fatty acids, and fat synthesis, and a decrease \r\nin carbon dioxide. Factors that lower the stress hormones, increase \r\ncarbon dioxide, and help to lower the circulating free fatty acids, \r\nlactate, and ammonia, include vitamin B1 (to increase CO2 and reduce \r\nlactate), niacinamide (to reduce free fatty acids), sugar (to reduce \r\ncortisol, adrenaline, and free fatty acids), salt (to lower adrenaline), \r\nthyroid hormone (to increase CO2). Vitamins D, K, B6 and biotin are \r\nalso closely involved with carbon dioxide metabolism. Biotin deficiency \r\ncan cause aerobic glycolysis with increased fat synthesis (Marshall, \r\net al., 1976). A \r\nprotein deficiency, possibly by increasing cortisol, is likely to contribute \r\nto increased FAS and fat synthesis (Bannister, et al., 1983), but the \r\ndietary protein shouldn't provide an excess of tryptophan, because of \r\ntryptophan's role as serotonin precursor--serotonin increases inflammation \r\nand glycolysis (Koren-Schwartzer, et al., 1994). Incidental \r\nstresses, such as strenuous exercise combined with fasting (e.g., running \r\nor working before eating breakfast) not only directly trigger the production \r\nof lactate and ammonia, they also are likely to increase the absorption \r\nof bacterial endotoxin from the intestine. Endotoxin is a ubiquitous \r\nand chronic stressor. It increases lactate and nitric oxide, poisoning \r\nmitochondrial respiration, precipitating the secretion of the adaptive \r\nstress hormones, which don't always fully repair the cellular damage. Aspirin \r\nprotects cells in many ways, interrupting excitotoxic processes by blocking \r\nnitric oxide and prostaglandins, and consequently it inhibits cell proliferation, \r\nand in some cases inhibits glycolysis, but the fact that it can inhibit \r\nFAS (Beynen, et al., 1982) is very important in understanding its role \r\nin cancer. There \r\nare several specific signals produced by lactate that can promote growth \r\nand other features of cancer, and it happens that aspirin antagonizes \r\nthose: HIF, NF-kappaB, the kinase cascades, cyclin D1, and heme oxygenase. Lactate \r\nand inflammation promote each other in a vicious cycle (Kawauchi, et \r\nal., 2008). The \r\ntoxic mechanism of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) involves \r\ninappropriate stimulation (Wang and White, 1999) of cells, followed \r\nby inflammation and mitochondrial inhibition. The stimulation seems \r\nto be a direct \"biophysical\" action on cells, causing them \r\nto take up water (Minutoli, et al., 2008), which is especially interesting, \r\nsince estrogen's immediate excitatory effect causes cells to take up \r\nwater. Hypoosmolarity \r\nitself is excitatory and anabolic. It stimulates lipolysis and fat oxidation \r\n(Keller, et al. 2003), and osmotic swelling stimulates glycolysis and \r\ninhibits mitochondrial respiration (Levko, et al., 2000). Endotoxin \r\ncauses hyponatremia (Tyler, et al., 1994), and a hypertonic salt solution \r\nis protective, lactate solutions are harmful. Other stresses and inflammations \r\nalso cause hyponatremia. One \r\nof the effects of endotoxin that leads to prolonged cellular excitation \r\nis its inhibition of the glucuronidation system (Bánhegyi, et al., \r\n1995), since this inhibition allows excitatory estrogen to accumulate. In \r\nwomen and rats, antibiotics were found to cause blood levels of estrogen \r\nand cortisol to decrease, while progesterone increased. This effect \r\napparently resulted from the liver's increased ability to inactivate \r\nestrogen and to maintain blood sugar when the endotoxin stress was decreased. Now \r\nthat hog farmers' use of antibiotics to stimulate growth has been discouraged, \r\nthey have sought vegetables that have a natural antibiotic effect, reducing \r\nthe formation and absorption of the intestinal toxins. The human diet \r\ncan be similarly adjusted, to minimize the production and absorption \r\nof the bacterial toxins. In \r\n2007, two Canadian researchers announced that they were investigating \r\nthe drug dichloroacetate, which blocks glycolysis, stopping the production \r\nof lactic acid, as a cancer treatment, with success. The drug (dichloroacetate) \r\nhas toxic side effects, but it is useful in several other conditions \r\ninvolving over-production of lactic acid. Other drugs that inhibit glycolysis \r\nhave also shown anticancer effects in animals, but are in themselves \r\nvery toxic. On the theoretical level, it would be better to inhibit \r\nonly aerobic glycolysis, rather than inhibiting enzymes that are essential \r\nfor all glycolysis. Since \r\nendotoxemia can produce aerobic glycolysis in an otherwise healthy person \r\n(Bundgaard, et al., 2003), a minimally \"Warburgian\" approach--i.e,, \r\na merely reasonable approach--would involve minimizing the absorption \r\nof endotoxin. Inhibiting bacterial growth, while optimizing intestinal \r\nresistance, would have no harmful side effects. Preventing excessive \r\nsympathetic nervous activity and maintaining the intestine's energy \r\nproduction can be achieved by optimizing hormones and nutrition. Something \r\nas simple as a grated carrot with salt and vinegar can produce major \r\nchanges in bowel health, reducing endotoxin absorption, and restoring \r\nconstructive hormonal functions. Medical \r\ntradition and inertia make it unlikely that the connection between cancer \r\nand bowel toxins will be recognized by the mainstream of medicine and \r\ngovernemt. In another article I will describe some of the recent history \r\nrelating to this issue. It's \r\nnice that some cancer researchers are now remembering Warburg, but unfortunately \r\nthey are usually just fitting the fact of cancer's aerobic glycolysis \r\ninto the genetic mutant cell paradigm, thinking of the respiratory defect \r\nas just another opportunity for killing the evil deviant cancer cell, \r\nrather than looking for the causes of the respiratory defect. Warburg, \r\nKoch, and Szent-Gyorgyi had a comprehensive view of biology, in which \r\nthe aerobic production of lactate, resulting from a respiratory defect, \r\nitself was functonally related to the nature of cancer. A \r\nfocus on correcting the respiratory defect would be relevant for all \r\nof the diseases and conditions (including heart disease, diabetes, dementia) \r\ninvolving inflammation and inappropriate excitation, not just for cancer.

From the early petrochemical Green Revolution \r\nto the contemporary imposition of genetically altered seeds, the accumulated \r\neconomic power of the food industry has taken control of the food culture.In \r\nevaluating each research publication relating to nutrition and health, \r\nwe should ask what alternative possibilities are being neglected, for \r\npractical reasons, cultural preferences, and business interests.Some \r\npeople with an ecological concern have argued that grains and beans \r\ncan most economically provide the proteins and calories that people \r\nneed, but good nutrition involves much more than the essential nutrients.Efficient \r\nindustrial agriculture has been concerned with cheaply producing those \r\nimportant nutrients, and their critics have focussed on their use of \r\ntoxic chemicals, on the social damage they produce, the degradation \r\nof the soil, the toxic effects of genetic modification, their unsustainable \r\nuse of petroleum, and occasionally on the lower nutritional value of \r\nchemically stimulated crops.I \r\nthink far too little attention is being given to the effects of abnormal \r\nand stressful growth conditions on the plants' natural defense systems. \r\nPlants normally synthesize some toxins and inhibitors of digestive enzymes \r\nto discourage attacks by bacteria, fungi, insects, and other predators. \r\nWhen a plant is injured or otherwise stressed, it produces more of the \r\ndefensive substances, and very often they communicate their stress to \r\nother plants, and the resulting physiological changes can cause changes \r\nin seeds that affect the resistance of the progeny. (Agrawal, 2001)One \r\nof many substances produced by plants in response to injury is chitinase, \r\nan enzyme that breaks down chitin, a polysaccharide that is a structural \r\ncomponent of fungi and insects. Chitinase, which is produced by bacteria \r\nand humans, as well as by plants and other organisms, is involved in \r\ndevelopmental processes as well as in the innate immune system. In plants, \r\nthe enzyme is induced by ethylene and salicylate, in animals by estrogen, \r\nlight damage, and infections, and can be demonstrated in polyps and \r\ncancers.The \r\ntwo main classes of plant allergens are the stress-induced chitinases, \r\nand seed storage proteins, such as gluten. The chitinase allergens are \r\nresponsible for reactions to latex (which is secreted by rubber trees \r\nin reaction to a wound), bananas, avocados, many other fruits and vegetables, \r\nand some types of wood and other plant materials. Intensive agricultural \r\nmethods are increasing the formation of the defensive chemicals, and \r\nthe industrialized crops are responsible for the great majority of the \r\nnew allergies that have appeared in the last 30 years.The \r\npresence of the chitinase family of proteins in humans was first discovered \r\nin the inflamed asthmatic lung. It was then found at high levels in \r\nthe uterine endometrium at the time of implantation of the embryo (an \r\ninflammation-like situation) and in the uterus during premature labor. \r\nSince estrogen treatment is known to increase the incidence of asthma \r\nand other inflammations, the appearance of chitinase also in the uterus \r\nin estrogen dominated conditions is interesting, especially when the \r\nrole of estrogen in celiac disease (in effect an allergy to gluten) \r\nis considered. Celiac disease is more prevalent among females, and it \r\ninvolves the immunological cross-reaction to an antigen in the estrogen-regulated \r\ntransglutaminase enzyme and the gluten protein. The (calcium-regulated) \r\ntransglutaminase enzyme is involved in the cross-linking of proteins \r\nin keratinized cells, in fibrotic processes in the liver, and in cancer. \r\n(People with celiac disease often suffer from osteoporosis and urinary \r\nstone deposition, showing a general problem with calcium regulation.)This \r\nmeans that estrogen and stress cause the appearance of antigens in the \r\nhuman or animal tissues that are essentially the same as the stress-induced \r\nand defensive proteins in plant tissues. A crocodile might experience \r\nthe same sort of allergic reaction when eating estrogen-treated women \r\nand when eating commercial bananas.The \r\nvarious states of the innate immune system have been neglected by immunologists, \r\nfor example in relation to organ transplantation. The major histocompatibility \r\nantigens are matched, but organ transplants still sometimes fail. A \r\nstudy found that the livers from young men had a high survival rate \r\nwhen transplanted into either men or women, but the livers of older \r\nwomen donors were rejected at a high rate when transplanted into either \r\nmen or women. Exposure to estrogen increases intracellular calcium and \r\nthe unsaturation of fatty acids in tissue lipids, and the expression \r\nof enzymes such as chitinase and transglutaminase, and the various enzymes \r\nin the structure-sensitive estrogen-controlled metabolic pathways.Estrogen's \r\nactions are closely and pervasively involved with the regulation of \r\ncalcium, and these changes affect the basic tissue structures and processes \r\nthat constitute the innate immune system. Estrogen's effect in increasing \r\nsusceptibility to autoimmune diseases hasn't yet been recognized \r\nby mainstream medicine.The \r\nchemist Norman Pirie argued convincingly that leaf protein had much \r\nhigher nutritional value than grain and bean proteins, and that it had \r\nthe potential to be much more efficient economically, if it could be \r\nseparated from the less desirable components of leaves.The \r\namino acid composition and nutritional value of leaf protein is similar \r\nto milk protein, which is understandable since cows produce milk from \r\nthe amino acids produced in their rumens by bacteria digesting the leaves \r\nthe cows have eaten. The bacteria perform the refining processes that \r\nPirie believed could be done technologically, and they also degrade \r\nor detoxify the major toxins and allergens.The \r\nnutrients produced in the cow's rumen are selectively absorbed into \r\nthe cow's bloodstream, where the liver can further filter out any toxins \r\nbefore the amino acids and other nutrients are absorbed by the udder \r\nto be synthesized into milk. If cows are fed extremely bad diets, for \r\nexample with a very large amount of grain, the filtering process is \r\nless perfect, and some allergens can reach the milk, but since sick \r\ncows are less profitable than healthy cows, dairies usually feed their \r\ncows fairly well.In \r\na recent study of 69,796 hospitalized newborns, a diagnosis of cow's \r\nmilk allergy was made in 0.21% of them. Among those whose birthweight \r\nhad been less than a kilogram, 0.35% of them were diagnosed with the \r\nmilk allergy. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the main reason for the \r\ndiagnosis, but a challenge test to confirm the diagnosis was used in \r\nonly 15% of the participating hospitals, and a lymphocyte stimulation \r\ntest was used in only 5.5% of them (Miyazawa, et al., 2009). There are \r\nmany publications about milk allergies, but they generally involve a \r\nsmall group of patients, and the tests they use are rarely evaluated \r\non healthy control subjects.Several \r\nsurveys have found that of children who have a diagnosed milk allergy, \r\nabout 2/3 of them grow out of the allergy.People \r\nwho have told me that they have had digestive problems with milk have \r\nsometimes found that a different brand of milk doesn't cause any problem.Milk \r\nwith reduced fat content is required by US law to have vitamins D and \r\nA added. The vehicle used in the vitamin preparation, and the industrial \r\ncontaminants in the pure vitamins themselves, are possible sources \r\nof allergens in commercial milk, so whole milk is the most likely to \r\nbe free of allergens.A \r\nthickening agent commonly used in milk products, carrageenan, is a powerful \r\nallergen that can cause a pseudo-latex allergy (Tarlo, et al., \r\n1995). It is a sulfated polysaccharide, structurally similar to heparin. \r\nThere are good reasons to think that its toxic effects are the result \r\nof disturbance of calcium metabolism (see for example Abdullahi, et \r\nal., 1975; Halici, et al., 2008; Janaswamy and Chandrasekaran, 2008).Besides \r\nthe idea of milk allergy, the most common reason for avoiding milk is \r\nthe belief that the genes of some ethnic groups cause them to lack the \r\nenzyme, lactase, needed to digest milk sugar, lactose, and that this \r\ncauses lactose intolerance, resulting in gas or diarrhea when milk is \r\nconsumed. Tests have been reported in which a glass of milk will cause \r\nthe lactase deficient people to have abdominal pain. However, when intolerant \r\npeople have been tested, using milk without lactose for comparison, \r\nthere were no differences between those receiving milk with lactose \r\nor without it. The intolerant people consistently tolerate having \r\na glass with each meal.When \r\na group of lactase deficient people have been given some milk every \r\nday for a few weeks, they have adapted, for example with tests showing \r\nthat much less hydrogen gas was produced from lactose by intestinal \r\nbacteria after they had adapted (Pribila, et al., 2000).Bacterial \r\novergrowth in the small intestine can be caused by hypothyroidism (Lauritano, \r\net al., 2007), and the substances produced by these bacteria can damage \r\nthe lining of the small intestine, causing the loss of lactase enzymes \r\n(Walshe, et al., 1990).Another \r\nhormonal condition that probably contributes to lactase deficiency is \r\nprogesterone deficiency, since a synthetic progestin has been found \r\nto increase the enzyme (Nagpaul, et al., 1990). The particular progestin \r\nthey used lacks many of progesterone's effects, but it does protect \r\nagainst some kinds of stress, including high estrogen and cortisol. \r\nThis suggests that stress, with its increased ratio of estrogen and \r\ncortisol to progesterone, might commonly cause the enzyme to decrease.Two \r\nother ideas that sometimes cause people to avoid drinking milk and eating \r\ncheese are that they are fattening foods, and that the high calcium \r\ncontent could contribute to hardening of the arteries.When \r\nI traveled around Europe in 1968, I noticed that milk and cheese were \r\nhard to find in the Slavic countries, and that many people were fat. \r\nWhen I crossed from Russia into Finland, I noticed there were many stores \r\nselling a variety of cheeses, and the people were generally slender. \r\nWhen I lived in Mexico in the 1960s, good milk was hard to find in the \r\ncities and towns, and most women had fat hips and short legs. Twenty \r\nyears later, when good milk was available in all the cites, there were \r\nmany more slender women, and the young people on average had much longer \r\nlegs. The changes I noticed there reminded me of the differences I had \r\nseen between Moscow and Helsinki, and I suspect that the differences \r\nin calcium intake were partly responsible for the changes of physique.In \r\nrecent years there have been studies showing that regular milk drinkers \r\nare less fat than people who don't drink it. Although the high quality \r\nprotein and saturated fat undoubtedly contribute to milk's anti-obesity \r\neffect, the high calcium content is probably the main factor.The \r\nparathyroid hormone (PTH) is an important regulator of calcium metabolism. \r\nIf dietary calcium isn't sufficient, causing blood calcium to decrease, \r\nthe PTH increases, and removes calcium from bones to maintain a normal \r\namount in the blood. PTH has many other effects, contributing to inflammation, \r\ncalcification of soft tissues, and decreased respiratory energy production.When \r\nthere is adequate calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium in the diet, PTH \r\nis kept to a minimum. When PTH is kept low, cells increase their formation \r\nof the uncoupling proteins, that cause mitochondria to use energy at \r\na higher rate, and this is associated with decreased activity of the \r\nfatty acid synthase enzymes.These \r\nchanges are clearly related to the anti-obesity effect of calcium, but \r\nthose enzymes are important for many other problems.The \r\nmetabolic syndrome, that involves diabetes, hypertension, and \r\nobesity, is associated with high PTH (Ahlström, et al., 2009; Hjelmesaeth, \r\net al., 2009).Alzheimer's \r\ndisease involves decreased mitochondrial activity and low levels of \r\nthe uncoupling proteins. There is evidence that milk drinkers are protected \r\nagainst dementia (Yamada, et al., 2003). Cancer involves increased activity \r\nof the fatty acid synthase enzymes. Increased calcium consumption beneficially \r\naffects both sets of enzymes, uncoupling proteins and fatty acid synthase.Multiple \r\nsclerosis relapses consistently occur at times of high PTH, and remissions \r\nconsistently occur at times of low PTH (Soilu-Hänninen, et al., 3008). \r\nPTH increases the activity of nitric oxide synthase, and nitric oxide \r\nis a factor in the vascular leakiness that is so important in MS.There \r\nare components of milk that might protect against tooth decay by inhibiting \r\nthe binding of bacteria to teeth (Danielsson, et al., 2009).David \r\nMcCarron has published a large amount of evidence showing how calcium \r\ndeficiency contributes to high blood pressure. The chronic elevation \r\nof PTH caused by calcium deficiency causes the heart and blood vessels \r\nto retain calcium, making them unable to relax fully.Intravenous \r\ninfusion of calcium can relax blood vessels and improve heart function. \r\nThe suppression of PTH is probably the main mechanism.PTH \r\n(like estrogen) causes mast cells to release promoters of inflammation, \r\nincluding histamine and serotonin. Serotonin and nitric oxide contribute \r\nto increasing PTH secretion.Removal \r\nof the parathyroid gland has reduced heart problems and mortality (Costa-Hong, \r\net al., 2007) and insomnia (Esposito, et al., 2008; Sabbatini, et al., \r\n2002) in people with kidney disease and excess PTH.Increased \r\ncarbon dioxide, for example when adapted to high altitude, can greatly \r\ndecrease PTH. Frequent, but smaller, meals can reduce PTH.Cancer \r\ncells often secrete PTH and related proteins with similar effects on \r\ncalcium, and the PTH stimulates the growth and invasiveness of prostate \r\ncancer (DaSilva, et al., 2009) cells, and seems to be as closely involved \r\nwith breast cancer. The PTH-related protein is associated with calcification \r\nin breast cancer (Kanbara, et al., 1994). Microscopic calcium crystals \r\nthemselve produce inflammation (Denko and Whitehouse, 1976).Besides \r\nbeing an ecologically favorable source of calcium, protein, sugar, and \r\nfat, the composition of milk causes it to be digested efficiently, supporting \r\nthe growth of bacteria that are relatively safe for the intestine and \r\nliver, and reducing the absorption of endotoxin.Dividing \r\nany food into smaller meals can lower the PTH, and milk is a convenient \r\nfood to use in small amounts and frequently.Some \r\namino acids directly stimulate insulin secretion, decreasing blood sugar \r\nand leading to the secretion of cortisol in reaction to the depression \r\nof blood glucose. The presence of lactose in milk, and of fat, to slow \r\nabsorption of the amino acids, helps to minimize the secretion of cortisol. \r\nThe main protein of milk, casein, seems to have some direct antistress \r\neffects (Biswas, et al., 2003).Since \r\nmilk's primary biological function is to support the growth of a young \r\nanimal, some of its features make it inappropriate as a sole food for \r\nan adult. To support cell division and growth, the methionine and tryptophan \r\ncontent of milk is higher than would be optimal for an adult animal, \r\nand the phosphate might be slightly more than needed, in relation to \r\nthe calcium. Since the fetus stores a large amount of iron during gestation, \r\nthe iron content of milk is low, and when a young animal has used the \r\nstored iron, its continuing growth requires more iron than milk provides. \r\nHowever, for an adult, the low iron content of milk and cheese makes \r\nthese foods useful for preventing the iron overload that often contributes \r\nto the degenerative diseases.Combining \r\nmilk and cheese with fruits adds to the antistress effect. The additional \r\nsugar and potassium and other minerals allow the milk protein to be \r\nused more efficiently, by moderating the secretion of cortisol, and \r\nhelping to inhibit the secretion of PTH.Substances \r\nsuch as PTH, nitric oxide, serotonin, cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, \r\nthyroid stimulating hormone, and prolactin have regulatory and adaptive \r\nfunctions that are essential, but that ideally should act only intermittently, \r\nproducing changes that are needed momentarily. When the environment \r\nis too stressful, or when nutrition isn't adequate, the organism may \r\nbe unable to mobilize the opposing and complementary substances to stop \r\ntheir actions. In those situations, it can be therapeutic to use some \r\nof the nutrients as supplements. Calcium carbonate (eggshell or oyster \r\nshell, for example) and vitamins D and K, can sometimes produce quick \r\nantistress effects, alleviating insomnia, hypertension, edema, inflammations \r\nand allergies, etc., but the regular use of milk and cheese can prevent \r\nmany chronic stress-related diseases.REFERENCESAgents \r\nActions. 1975 Oct;5(4):371-3.Effect of calcitonin on carrageenan \r\nfoot oedema.Abdullahi SE, De Bastiani G, Nogarin L, Velo GP.Am \r\nNat. 2001 May;157(5):555-69.Transgenerational consequences of plant \r\nresponses to herbivory: an adaptive maternal effect?Agrawal AA.Clin \r\nEndocrinol (Oxf). 2009 Nov;71(5):673-8.Correlation between plasma \r\ncalcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) \r\nin a community-based cohort of men and women.Ahlström T, Hagström E, Larsson A, Rudberg C, Lind L, Hellman P.Indian \r\nJ Exp Biol.  2003 Apr;41(4):367-9.Protection of adrenocortical \r\nactivity by dietary casein in ether anaesthetized rats.Biswas NM, \r\nChattopadhyay A, Sarkar M. Ether anaesthesia to 20% casein fed rats \r\ncaused no change in adrenal delta5-3beta-HSD activity and serum corticosterone \r\nlevel when compared with controls fed 20% casein diet.The results \r\nsuggest that high milk protein diet may prevent acute stress effects \r\nby protecting adrenocortical activity.The present investigation \r\nopens up a new area of management of stress.Am \r\nJ Clin Nutr. 2008 Oct;88(4):877-85.Dairy calcium supplementation \r\nin overweight or obese persons: its effect on markers of fat metabolism.Bortolotti M, Rudelle S, Schneiter P, Vidal H, Loizon E, Tappy L, Acheson \r\nKJ.J \r\nAm Coll Nutr. 2005 Dec;24(6 Suppl):569S-73S.The myth of increased \r\nlactose intolerance in African-Americans.Byers KG, Savaiano DA.Exp \r\nEye Res. 2004 Aug;79(2):239-47.Light damage induced changes in mouse \r\nretinal gene expression.Chen L, Wu W, Dentchev T, Zeng Y, Wang \r\nJ, Tsui I, Tobias JW, Bennett J, Baldwin D, Dunaief JL.J \r\nUrol. 2008 Sep;180(3):974-9.

Most attention has been given to theories \r\nabout changes in people, such as the reduction in infectious diseases \r\nand parasites, or vitamin D deficiency, or harmful effects from vaccinations, \r\nand little attention has been given to degradation of the food supply. Our \r\nfood cultures, like linguistic and moral cultures, give us some assumptions \r\nor theories about the way the world should be, and if these beliefs \r\naren't questioned and tested, they can permeate the culture of science, \r\nturning the research process into a rationalization of accepted opinions. In \r\ngeneral, those who pay for research are those with an investment in \r\nor commitment to the preservation and expansion of the existing systems \r\nof production and distribution. Cheap mass production, durability and \r\nlong shelf-life are more important than the effects of foods on health. \r\nThe biggest industries are usually able to keep public attention away \r\nfrom the harm they do. The \r\nhistorical economic importance of cereals and beans is reflected in \r\nthe nutritional and biochemical research literature, which has paid \r\nrelatively little attention to basic questions about human adaptation \r\nto the ecosystems. From the early petrochemical Green Revolution \r\nto the contemporary imposition of genetically altered seeds, the accumulated \r\neconomic power of the food industry has taken control of the food culture. In \r\nevaluating each research publication relating to nutrition and health, \r\nwe should ask what alternative possibilities are being neglected, for \r\npractical reasons, cultural preferences, and business interests. Some \r\npeople with an ecological concern have argued that grains and beans \r\ncan most economically provide the proteins and calories that people \r\nneed, but good nutrition involves much more than the essential nutrients. Efficient \r\nindustrial agriculture has been concerned with cheaply producing those \r\nimportant nutrients, and their critics have focussed on their use of \r\ntoxic chemicals, on the social damage they produce, the degradation \r\nof the soil, the toxic effects of genetic modification, their unsustainable \r\nuse of petroleum, and occasionally on the lower nutritional value of \r\nchemically stimulated crops. I \r\nthink far too little attention is being given to the effects of abnormal \r\nand stressful growth conditions on the plants' natural defense systems. \r\nPlants normally synthesize some toxins and inhibitors of digestive enzymes \r\nto discourage attacks by bacteria, fungi, insects, and other predators. \r\nWhen a plant is injured or otherwise stressed, it produces more of the \r\ndefensive substances, and very often they communicate their stress to \r\nother plants, and the resulting physiological changes can cause changes \r\nin seeds that affect the resistance of the progeny. (Agrawal, 2001) One \r\nof many substances produced by plants in response to injury is chitinase, \r\nan enzyme that breaks down chitin, a polysaccharide that is a structural \r\ncomponent of fungi and insects. Chitinase, which is produced by bacteria \r\nand humans, as well as by plants and other organisms, is involved in \r\ndevelopmental processes as well as in the innate immune system. In plants, \r\nthe enzyme is induced by ethylene and salicylate, in animals by estrogen, \r\nlight damage, and infections, and can be demonstrated in polyps and \r\ncancers. The \r\ntwo main classes of plant allergens are the stress-induced chitinases, \r\nand seed storage proteins, such as gluten. The chitinase allergens are \r\nresponsible for reactions to latex (which is secreted by rubber trees \r\nin reaction to a wound), bananas, avocados, many other fruits and vegetables, \r\nand some types of wood and other plant materials. Intensive agricultural \r\nmethods are increasing the formation of the defensive chemicals, and \r\nthe industrialized crops are responsible for the great majority of the \r\nnew allergies that have appeared in the last 30 years. The \r\npresence of the chitinase family of proteins in humans was first discovered \r\nin the inflamed asthmatic lung. It was then found at high levels in \r\nthe uterine endometrium at the time of implantation of the embryo (an \r\ninflammation-like situation) and in the uterus during premature labor. \r\nSince estrogen treatment is known to increase the incidence of asthma \r\nand other inflammations, the appearance of chitinase also in the uterus \r\nin estrogen dominated conditions is interesting, especially when the \r\nrole of estrogen in celiac disease (in effect an allergy to gluten) \r\nis considered. Celiac disease is more prevalent among females, and it \r\ninvolves the immunological cross-reaction to an antigen in the estrogen-regulated \r\ntransglutaminase enzyme and the gluten protein. The (calcium-regulated) \r\ntransglutaminase enzyme is involved in the cross-linking of proteins \r\nin keratinized cells, in fibrotic processes in the liver, and in cancer. \r\n(People with celiac disease often suffer from osteoporosis and urinary \r\nstone deposition, showing a general problem with calcium regulation.) This \r\nmeans that estrogen and stress cause the appearance of antigens in the \r\nhuman or animal tissues that are essentially the same as the stress-induced \r\nand defensive proteins in plant tissues. A crocodile might experience \r\nthe same sort of allergic reaction when eating estrogen-treated women \r\nand when eating commercial bananas. The \r\nvarious states of the innate immune system have been neglected by immunologists, \r\nfor example in relation to organ transplantation. The major histocompatibility \r\nantigens are matched, but organ transplants still sometimes fail. A \r\nstudy found that the livers from young men had a high survival rate \r\nwhen transplanted into either men or women, but the livers of older \r\nwomen donors were rejected at a high rate when transplanted into either \r\nmen or women. Exposure to estrogen increases intracellular calcium and \r\nthe unsaturation of fatty acids in tissue lipids, and the expression \r\nof enzymes such as chitinase and transglutaminase, and the various enzymes \r\nin the structure-sensitive estrogen-controlled metabolic pathways. Estrogen's \r\nactions are closely and pervasively involved with the regulation of \r\ncalcium, and these changes affect the basic tissue structures and processes \r\nthat constitute the innate immune system. Estrogen's effect in increasing \r\nsusceptibility to autoimmune diseases hasn't yet been recognized \r\nby mainstream medicine. The \r\nchemist Norman Pirie argued convincingly that leaf protein had much \r\nhigher nutritional value than grain and bean proteins, and that it had \r\nthe potential to be much more efficient economically, if it could be \r\nseparated from the less desirable components of leaves. The \r\namino acid composition and nutritional value of leaf protein is similar \r\nto milk protein, which is understandable since cows produce milk from \r\nthe amino acids produced in their rumens by bacteria digesting the leaves \r\nthe cows have eaten. The bacteria perform the refining processes that \r\nPirie believed could be done technologically, and they also degrade \r\nor detoxify the major toxins and allergens. The \r\nnutrients produced in the cow's rumen are selectively absorbed into \r\nthe cow's bloodstream, where the liver can further filter out any toxins \r\nbefore the amino acids and other nutrients are absorbed by the udder \r\nto be synthesized into milk. If cows are fed extremely bad diets, for \r\nexample with a very large amount of grain, the filtering process is \r\nless perfect, and some allergens can reach the milk, but since sick \r\ncows are less profitable than healthy cows, dairies usually feed their \r\ncows fairly well. In \r\na recent study of 69,796 hospitalized newborns, a diagnosis of cow's \r\nmilk allergy was made in 0.21% of them. Among those whose birthweight \r\nhad been less than a kilogram, 0.35% of them were diagnosed with the \r\nmilk allergy. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the main reason for the \r\ndiagnosis, but a challenge test to confirm the diagnosis was used in \r\nonly 15% of the participating hospitals, and a lymphocyte stimulation \r\ntest was used in only 5.5% of them (Miyazawa, et al., 2009). There are \r\nmany publications about milk allergies, but they generally involve a \r\nsmall group of patients, and the tests they use are rarely evaluated \r\non healthy control subjects. Several \r\nsurveys have found that of children who have a diagnosed milk allergy, \r\nabout 2/3 of them grow out of the allergy. People \r\nwho have told me that they have had digestive problems with milk have \r\nsometimes found that a different brand of milk doesn't cause any problem. Milk \r\nwith reduced fat content is required by US law to have vitamins D and \r\nA added. The vehicle used in the vitamin preparation, and the industrial \r\ncontaminants in the pure vitamins themselves, are possible sources \r\nof allergens in commercial milk, so whole milk is the most likely to \r\nbe free of allergens. A \r\nthickening agent commonly used in milk products, carrageenan, is a powerful \r\nallergen that can cause a pseudo-latex allergy (Tarlo, et al., \r\n1995). It is a sulfated polysaccharide, structurally similar to heparin. \r\nThere are good reasons to think that its toxic effects are the result \r\nof disturbance of calcium metabolism (see for example Abdullahi, et \r\nal., 1975; Halici, et al., 2008; Janaswamy and Chandrasekaran, 2008). Besides \r\nthe idea of milk allergy, the most common reason for avoiding milk is \r\nthe belief that the genes of some ethnic groups cause them to lack the \r\nenzyme, lactase, needed to digest milk sugar, lactose, and that this \r\ncauses lactose intolerance, resulting in gas or diarrhea when milk is \r\nconsumed. Tests have been reported in which a glass of milk will cause \r\nthe lactase deficient people to have abdominal pain. However, when intolerant \r\npeople have been tested, using milk without lactose for comparison, \r\nthere were no differences between those receiving milk with lactose \r\nor without it. The intolerant people consistently tolerate having \r\na glass with each meal. When \r\na group of lactase deficient people have been given some milk every \r\nday for a few weeks, they have adapted, for example with tests showing \r\nthat much less hydrogen gas was produced from lactose by intestinal \r\nbacteria after they had adapted (Pribila, et al., 2000). Bacterial \r\novergrowth in the small intestine can be caused by hypothyroidism (Lauritano, \r\net al., 2007), and the substances produced by these bacteria can damage \r\nthe lining of the small intestine, causing the loss of lactase enzymes \r\n(Walshe, et al., 1990). Another \r\nhormonal condition that probably contributes to lactase deficiency is \r\nprogesterone deficiency, since a synthetic progestin has been found \r\nto increase the enzyme (Nagpaul, et al., 1990). The particular progestin \r\nthey used lacks many of progesterone's effects, but it does protect \r\nagainst some kinds of stress, including high estrogen and cortisol. \r\nThis suggests that stress, with its increased ratio of estrogen and \r\ncortisol to progesterone, might commonly cause the enzyme to decrease. Two \r\nother ideas that sometimes cause people to avoid drinking milk and eating \r\ncheese are that they are fattening foods, and that the high calcium \r\ncontent could contribute to hardening of the arteries. When \r\nI traveled around Europe in 1968, I noticed that milk and cheese were \r\nhard to find in the Slavic countries, and that many people were fat. \r\nWhen I crossed from Russia into Finland, I noticed there were many stores \r\nselling a variety of cheeses, and the people were generally slender. \r\nWhen I lived in Mexico in the 1960s, good milk was hard to find in the \r\ncities and towns, and most women had fat hips and short legs. Twenty \r\nyears later, when good milk was available in all the cites, there were \r\nmany more slender women, and the young people on average had much longer \r\nlegs. The changes I noticed there reminded me of the differences I had \r\nseen between Moscow and Helsinki, and I suspect that the differences \r\nin calcium intake were partly responsible for the changes of physique. In \r\nrecent years there have been studies showing that regular milk drinkers \r\nare less fat than people who don't drink it. Although the high quality \r\nprotein and saturated fat undoubtedly contribute to milk's anti-obesity \r\neffect, the high calcium content is probably the main factor. The \r\nparathyroid hormone (PTH) is an important regulator of calcium metabolism. \r\nIf dietary calcium isn't sufficient, causing blood calcium to decrease, \r\nthe PTH increases, and removes calcium from bones to maintain a normal \r\namount in the blood. PTH has many other effects, contributing to inflammation, \r\ncalcification of soft tissues, and decreased respiratory energy production. When \r\nthere is adequate calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium in the diet, PTH \r\nis kept to a minimum. When PTH is kept low, cells increase their formation \r\nof the uncoupling proteins, that cause mitochondria to use energy at \r\na higher rate, and this is associated with decreased activity of the \r\nfatty acid synthase enzymes. These \r\nchanges are clearly related to the anti-obesity effect of calcium, but \r\nthose enzymes are important for many other problems. The \r\nmetabolic syndrome, that involves diabetes, hypertension, and \r\nobesity, is associated with high PTH (Ahlström, et al., 2009; Hjelmesaeth, \r\net al., 2009). Alzheimer's \r\ndisease involves decreased mitochondrial activity and low levels of \r\nthe uncoupling proteins. There is evidence that milk drinkers are protected \r\nagainst dementia (Yamada, et al., 2003). Cancer involves increased activity \r\nof the fatty acid synthase enzymes. Increased calcium consumption beneficially \r\naffects both sets of enzymes, uncoupling proteins and fatty acid synthase. Multiple \r\nsclerosis relapses consistently occur at times of high PTH, and remissions \r\nconsistently occur at times of low PTH (Soilu-Hänninen, et al., 3008). \r\nPTH increases the activity of nitric oxide synthase, and nitric oxide \r\nis a factor in the vascular leakiness that is so important in MS. There \r\nare components of milk that might protect against tooth decay by inhibiting \r\nthe binding of bacteria to teeth (Danielsson, et al., 2009). David \r\nMcCarron has published a large amount of evidence showing how calcium \r\ndeficiency contributes to high blood pressure. The chronic elevation \r\nof PTH caused by calcium deficiency causes the heart and blood vessels \r\nto retain calcium, making them unable to relax fully. Intravenous \r\ninfusion of calcium can relax blood vessels and improve heart function. \r\nThe suppression of PTH is probably the main mechanism. PTH \r\n(like estrogen) causes mast cells to release promoters of inflammation, \r\nincluding histamine and serotonin. Serotonin and nitric oxide contribute \r\nto increasing PTH secretion. Removal \r\nof the parathyroid gland has reduced heart problems and mortality (Costa-Hong, \r\net al., 2007) and insomnia (Esposito, et al., 2008; Sabbatini, et al., \r\n2002) in people with kidney disease and excess PTH. Increased \r\ncarbon dioxide, for example when adapted to high altitude, can greatly \r\ndecrease PTH. Frequent, but smaller, meals can reduce PTH. Cancer \r\ncells often secrete PTH and related proteins with similar effects on \r\ncalcium, and the PTH stimulates the growth and invasiveness of prostate \r\ncancer (DaSilva, et al., 2009) cells, and seems to be as closely involved \r\nwith breast cancer. The PTH-related protein is associated with calcification \r\nin breast cancer (Kanbara, et al., 1994). Microscopic calcium crystals \r\nthemselve produce inflammation (Denko and Whitehouse, 1976). Besides \r\nbeing an ecologically favorable source of calcium, protein, sugar, and \r\nfat, the composition of milk causes it to be digested efficiently, supporting \r\nthe growth of bacteria that are relatively safe for the intestine and \r\nliver, and reducing the absorption of endotoxin. Dividing \r\nany food into smaller meals can lower the PTH, and milk is a convenient \r\nfood to use in small amounts and frequently. Some \r\namino acids directly stimulate insulin secretion, decreasing blood sugar \r\nand leading to the secretion of cortisol in reaction to the depression \r\nof blood glucose. The presence of lactose in milk, and of fat, to slow \r\nabsorption of the amino acids, helps to minimize the secretion of cortisol. \r\nThe main protein of milk, casein, seems to have some direct antistress \r\neffects (Biswas, et al., 2003). Since \r\nmilk's primary biological function is to support the growth of a young \r\nanimal, some of its features make it inappropriate as a sole food for \r\nan adult. To support cell division and growth, the methionine and tryptophan \r\ncontent of milk is higher than would be optimal for an adult animal, \r\nand the phosphate might be slightly more than needed, in relation to \r\nthe calcium. Since the fetus stores a large amount of iron during gestation, \r\nthe iron content of milk is low, and when a young animal has used the \r\nstored iron, its continuing growth requires more iron than milk provides. \r\nHowever, for an adult, the low iron content of milk and cheese makes \r\nthese foods useful for preventing the iron overload that often contributes \r\nto the degenerative diseases. Combining \r\nmilk and cheese with fruits adds to the antistress effect. The additional \r\nsugar and potassium and other minerals allow the milk protein to be \r\nused more efficiently, by moderating the secretion of cortisol, and \r\nhelping to inhibit the secretion of PTH. Substances \r\nsuch as PTH, nitric oxide, serotonin, cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, \r\nthyroid stimulating hormone, and prolactin have regulatory and adaptive \r\nfunctions that are essential, but that ideally should act only intermittently, \r\nproducing changes that are needed momentarily. When the environment \r\nis too stressful, or when nutrition isn't adequate, the organism may \r\nbe unable to mobilize the opposing and complementary substances to stop \r\ntheir actions. In those situations, it can be therapeutic to use some \r\nof the nutrients as supplements. Calcium carbonate (eggshell or oyster \r\nshell, for example) and vitamins D and K, can sometimes produce quick \r\nantistress effects, alleviating insomnia, hypertension, edema, inflammations \r\nand allergies, etc., but the regular use of milk and cheese can prevent \r\nmany chronic stress-related diseases.

I think it is evident that those \r\npeople don't know what would be involved in refuting an argument. They \r\nare annoyed that I have bothered them with some evidence, but not sufficiently \r\nannoyed to cause them to try to marshal some evidence against my arguments. Marketing \r\nand medical claims are intertwined with a view of life that permeates \r\nour culture. I am aware that my criticism of the doctrine of the essentiality \r\nof linoleic acid threatens the large profits of many people, and threatens \r\nthe prestige of the most popular \"theory of cell structure,\" \r\nbut I think it is important to point out that nutritional and medical \r\nadvice depend on the truth of the theory of cell structure and function \r\nwhich supports that advice, and so it is reasonable to see how sound \r\nthat theory is. As \r\nI understand it, the doctrine of the \"essential fatty acids\" \r\n\r\ngoes this way: 1. \r\nThey are essential because they are required for making cell membranes \r\nand prostaglandins. 2. \r\nRats deprived of the unsaturated fatty acids develop a skin disease, \r\nand \"lose water\" through the skin. 3. \r\nHuman skin diseases (etc.) can be cured with polyunsaturated fats. In \r\nfact, rats may get a skin disease when fed a fat-free diet, but the \r\nobservation that vitamin B6 cures it should have laid to rest the issue \r\nof the dietary essentiality of the polyunsaturated oils more than 50 \r\nyears ago. Scientifically, it did, but forces greater than science have \r\nrevivified the monster. Experiments that confirm the disproof are done \r\nperiodically--animals living generation after generation without unsaturated \r\noils in their diet or any evidence of harm, human cells growing in culture-dishes \r\nwithout polyunsaturated fats, for example--without noticeable effect \r\non the doctrine, which is perpetuated in many effective, nonscientific \r\nways--textbooks, advertisements, college courses, for example. Now, \r\ninstead of demonstrating harm from a dietary lack of the \"essential\" \r\nfats, the presence of the Mead acid or omega-9 fatty acids is taken \r\nas evidence of a deficiency. Our cells (and animal cells) produce these \r\nunsaturated fats when their special desaturase enzymes are not suppressed \r\nby the presence of exogenous linoleic or linolenic acids. Normally, \r\nthe inactivation of an enzyme system and the suppression of a natural \r\nbiological process might be taken as evidence of toxicity of the vegetable \r\noils, but here, the occurrence of the natural process is taken as evidence \r\nof a deficiency. To me, this seems very much like the \"disease\" \r\nof having tonsils, an appendix, or a foreskin--if it is there, you have \r\na problem, according to the aggressive surgical mentality. But what \r\nis the \"problem\" in the case of the natural Mead or omega-9 \r\nacids? (I think the \"problem\" is simply that they allow us \r\nto live at a higher energy level, with greater resistance to stress, \r\nbetter immunity, and quicker healing.) There \r\nhave been arguments based on \"membranes\" and on prostaglandins. \r\nThe absence of \"good\" prostaglandins would seem to be an obvious \r\nproblem, except that the \"good\" prostaglandins always turn \r\nout to have some seriously bad effects when examined in other contexts. \r\nAnimals that lack dietary unsaturated fats appear to escape most of \r\nthe problems that are associated with prostaglandins, and I think this \r\nmeans that many of the toxic effects of the unsaturated vegetable oils \r\nresult from the quantity and type of \"eicosanoid\"/lipoxygenase \r\nproducts made from them. One \r\ntype of membrane argument had to do with the fragility of red blood \r\ncells, reasoning, apparently, that the cells are \"held together\" \r\n\r\nby a lipid bilayer membrane. (Just what is the tensile strength of a \r\nlipid bilayer? Why do fatty acids or saponins weaken blood cells, instead \r\nof reinforcing them? If the \"tensile strength\" of a lipid \r\nlayer exists, and is positive rather than negative, it is negligible \r\nin relation to the tensile strength of the cytoplasm.) Another type \r\nof :\"membrane\" argument was that the mitochondria are abnormal \r\nwhen animals don't get the essential fatty acids in their diet, because \r\nthe mitochondria are supposed to be essentially membranous structures \r\ncontaining the essential fatty acids. (Actually, the deficient mitochondria \r\nproduce more ATP than do mitochondria from animals fed the vegetable \r\noils.) Another argument is that \"membrane fluidity\" is a good \r\nthing, and that unsaturated essential fatty acids make the membranes \r\nmore fluid and thus better--by analogy with their lower bulk-phase melting \r\ntemperature. (But the measure of fluidity is a very limited thing on \r\nthe molecular level, and this fluidity may be associated with decreased \r\ncellular function, instead of the postulated increase.) The \r\nmost addled sort of argument about \"membranes\" is that animals \r\non the diet lacking polyunsaturated oils have skin that is unable to \r\nretain water because of \"defective cell membranes.\" The skin's \r\nactual barrier function is the result of mulptile layers of keratinized \r\n(\"cornified,\" horny) cells, which have become specialized \r\nby their massive production of the protein keratin--very much as red \r\nblood cells become specialized by producing the protein, hemoglobin. \r\nSince these cells lose most of their water as they become horny, the \r\nissue of whether they still have a \"plasma membrane\" seems \r\nto have little interest to researchers; the same can be said regarding \r\nthe cells of hair and nails. After the epidermal cells have become keratinized \r\nand inert, the sebaceous glands in the skin secrete oils, which are \r\nabsorbed by the dense, proteinaceous cells, causing increased resistance \r\nto water absorption. The ideas of a plasma membrane on the cell, and \r\nof the water-barrier function of the skin, are two distinct things, \r\nthat have been blurred together in a thoughtless way. It has been suggested \r\nthat vitamin B6 cures the characteristic skin disorder of a vitamin \r\nB6 deficiency by altering fat metabolism, but the vitamin is involved \r\nin cell division and many other processes that affect the skin. Given \r\nthe fact that the \"essential\" oils aren't essential for the \r\ngrowth of cells, they can't be essential for making plasma membranes \r\n(if cells must have plasma membranes), or mitochondrial membranes, or \r\nany kind of membrane, but as long as there is the idea that fats mainly \r\nhave the function of building membranes, someone is going to argue that \r\nmembranes containing vegetable oils are more fluid, or more youthful, \r\nor more sensitive, or better in some way than those containing Mead \r\nacids, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, etc. For \r\nover a century, people have suggested that cells are enclosed in an \r\noily membrane, because there are higher or lower concentrations of many \r\nwater-soluble substances inside cells, than in the blood, lymph, and \r\nother extracellular fluids, and the idea of a membrane was invoked (W. \r\nPfeffer, 1877; E. Overton, 1895, 1902) to explain how that difference \r\ncan persist. (By 1904, the idea of a membrane largely made of lecithin \r\nwas made ludicrous by A. Nathansohn's observation that water-soaked \r\nlecithin loses its oily property, and becomes very hydrophilic; the \r\nmembrane was supposed to exclude water-soluble molecules while admitting \r\noil-soluble molecules.) Inside \r\nthe cell membrane, the cell substance was seen as a watery solution. \r\nBiochemistry, as a profession, was strongly based on the assumption \r\nthat, when a tissue is ground up in water, the dilute extract closely \r\nreflects the conditions that existed in the living cell. Around 1970, \r\nwhen I tried to talk to biochemists about ways to study the chemistry \r\nof cells that would more closely reflected the living state, a typical \r\nresponse was that the idea was ridiculous, because it questioned the \r\nexistence of biochemistry itself as a meaningful science.. But since \r\nthen, there has been a progressive recognition that organization is \r\nmore important in the life of a cell than had been recognized by traditional \r\nbiochemistry. Still, many biochemists thoughtlessly identify the chemistry \r\nof the living cell with their study of the water-soluble enzymes, and \r\nrelegate the insoluble residue of the cell to \"membrane-associated \r\nproteins\" or, less traditionally, to \"structural proteins.\" \r\n\r\nIt has been several decades since the structural/contractile protein \r\nof muscle was found to be an enzyme, an ATPase, but the idea that the \r\ncell itself is a sort of watery solution, in which the water-soluble \r\nenzymes float, randomly mingling with dissolved salts, sugars, etc., \r\npersists, and makes the idea of a semipermeable membrane seem necessary, \r\nto separate a \"watery internal phase\" from the watery external \r\nphase. Physical chemists have no trouble with the fact that a moist \r\nprotein can absorb oil as well as water, and the concept that even water-soluble \r\nenzymes have oil-loving interiors is well established. If that physical-chemical \r\ninformation had existed in Overton's time, there would have been no \r\nurge to postulate an oily membrane around cells, to allow substances \r\nto pass into them, in proportion to their solubility in oil. Because \r\nbiochemists like to study their enzymes in watery test-tube solutions, \r\nthey find it easy to think of the cell-substance as a watery solution. \r\nWith that belief, it is natural that they prefer to think of the primeval \r\nocean as where life originated. Their definitions of chemical reactions \r\nand equilibria in the water-phase (and by extension in cells) ignore \r\nthe alternative reactions and equilibria that would occur in an environment \r\nin which ordinary water was not the dominant medium. By this failure \r\nto consider the alternatives, they have created some problems that are \r\nhard to explain. For example, the polymerization of amino acids into \r\nprotein is energetically expensive in water, but it is spontaneous in \r\na relatively dry environment, and this spontaneous reaction creates \r\nnon-random structures with the capacity for building larger structures, \r\nwith stainable bilayer \"membranes,\" and with catalytic action. \r\n(Sidney Fox, 1965, 1973.) Similarly, the problem of ATP synthesis essentially \r\ndisappears when it is considered in an environment that controls water. \r\nThe scientific basis for the origin of life in a \"primeval soup\" \r\nnever really existed, and more people are now expressing their scepticism. \r\nHowever, biochemists have their commitments: \"In \r\nthe course of biological evolution, one of the first developments must \r\nhave been an oily membrane that enclosed the water-soluble molecules \r\nof the primitive cell, segregating them and allowing them to accumulate \r\nto relatively high concentrations. The molecules and ions contained \r\nwithin a living organism differ in kind and in concentration from those \r\nin the organism's surrounding.\" (Principles of Biochemistry, supposedly \r\nby Lehninger, Nelson, and Cox, though Lehninger is dead and I think \r\nhis name is attached to it to exploit his fame.# Worth Publishers, 1993.) Hair \r\nis composed of thoroughly dead cells, but if it is washed until it contains \r\nno sodium or potassium, and then dipped in serum, or a solution of sodium \r\nand potassium, it takes up much more potassium than sodium, in the way \r\na living cell does, concentrating potassium \"against the gradient.\" \r\nThat is the sort of behavior that led to the postulation of a plasma \r\nmembrane, to maintain the organization that was created by expending \r\nenergy. \"Membrane pumps\" use energy, supposedly, to establish \r\nthe concentration difference, and the barrier membrane keeps the solutes \r\nfrom diffusing away. The lipid bilayer membrane was an early guess, \r\nand the pumps were added later, as needed. Gilbert Ling reviewed the \r\npublished studies on the various \"membrane pumps,\" and found \r\nthat the energy needed to operate them was 15 times greater than all \r\nthe energy the cell could possibly produce. Water \r\nsofteners contain an ion-exchange resin, that uses the same principle \r\nhair does to concentrate ions, which is simply a selectivity based on \r\nthe acidity of the resin, and the size of the ion. The resin binds calcium \r\nmore strongly than it binds sodium, and so the water gives up its calcium \r\nin exchange for sodium.* Gilbert Ling devised many experiments that \r\ndemonstrated the passivity of ion-accumulation by living cells. Usually, \r\ncells are surrounded by and imbedded in materials that they have secreted, \r\nand their surfaces are often covered with materials that, while remaining \r\nanchored to the cell, have a considerable affinity for water. Physically, \r\nmany of the molecules attached to cells are \"surfactants,\" \r\n\r\nmaking the cell wettable, though it isn't customary to describe them \r\nas such. The glycoproteins that give cells their characteristic immunological \r\nproperties are among these materials. At a certain point, there is a \r\ntransition between the \"outside\" of the cell, which is relatively \r\npassive and water-friendly, and the cell itself, in which water is subordinated \r\nto the special conditions of the cell. (The postulated lipid bilayer \r\nmembrane, in contrast, has two phase discontinuities, one where it meets \r\nthe cytoplasm, another where it meets the outside world.) At this phase \r\nboundary, between two different substances, it is normal to find an \r\nelectrical potential difference. When two electrically different substances \r\nare in contact, it isn't surprising to find an electrical double-layer \r\nat the surface. This is a passive process, which doesn't take any energy \r\nto maintain, but it can account for specific arrangements of molecules \r\nin the region of the phase boundary, since they are exposed to the electrical \r\nforce of the electrical double-layer. That is to say that in a completely \r\ninert and homogeneous substance, a \"surface structure\" will \r\nbe generated, as a result of the electrical difference between that \r\nsubstance and the adjoining substance. (This surface structure, if it \r\nis to be described as a membrane, must be called a \"wet membrane,\" \r\nwhile the lipid bilayer would be a \"dry membrane,\" since exclusion \r\nof water is its reason for existing.) Too many biologists still talk \r\nabout \"electrogenic membrane pumps,\" indicating that they \r\nhaven't assimilated the results of Gilbert Ling's research. To \r\nsay it another way, there are several kinds of physical process that \r\nwill govern the behavior of fats, and fats of different types will interact \r\nin different ways with their environments. They interact complexly with \r\ntheir environment, serving in many cases as regulatory signal-substances. \r\nTo describe their role as \"membranes\" is worse than useless. Cells \r\ncan be treated with solvents to remove practically all fats, yet the \r\ncells can still show their characteristic membranes: Plasma membrane, \r\nmitochondrial membranes, even the myelin figures. The proteins that \r\nremain after the extraction of the fats appear to govern the structure \r\nof the cell. A \r\nsmall drop of water can float for a moment on the surface of water; \r\nthis is explained in terms of the organization of the water molecules \r\nnear the surface. No membrane is needed to explain this reluctance to \r\ncoalesce, even though water has a very high affinity for water. People \r\nbelieved in the \"lipid bilayer membrane\" for decades before \r\nthe electron microscope was able to produce an image that could be said \r\nto correspond to that theoretical structure. Osmic acid, which is believed \r\nto stain fats, does produce a double layer at the surface of cells. \r\nHowever, the arrangement of fat molecules in the lipid bilayer is such \r\nthat the fatty tails of the two layers are touching each other, while \r\ntheir acidic heads are pointed away from each other. A lipid bilayer, \r\nin other words, contains a single zone of fat, bounded by two layers \r\nof acid. The \"fat-staining\" property of osmic acid, then, \r\nargues against the lipid bilayer structure. Osmic \r\nacid is very easily reduced electrically, forming a black product. Proteins \r\nwith their sulfur molecules in a reduced state, for example, would cause \r\nan osmium compound to be deposited, and the appearance of two layers \r\nof osmium at the cell's phase boundary would be compatible with the \r\nidea of an electrical double-layer, induced in proteins. Electrically \r\ncharged proteins, which are able to interact with glutathione to increase \r\nor decrease their degree of reduction/electrical charge, distributed \r\nthroughout the cytoplasm, would explain another feature of osmic acid \r\nstaining, which is incompatible with the \"fat-staining\" concept. \r\nAsphyxia increases the stainability of cells with osmic acid, and this \r\nchange seems to represent the availability of electrons, rather than \r\nthe distribution of fats, since the change can appear within 3 minutes. \r\n(C. Peracchia and J. D. Robertson,\"Increase in osmiophilia \r\nof axonal membranes of crayfish as a result of electrical stimulation, \r\nasphyxia, or treatment with reducing agents,\"J. Cell Biol. \r\n51, 223, 1971; N. N. Bogolepov, Ultrastructure of the Brain in Hypoxia, \r\nMir, Moscow, 1983) The amino groups of proteins might also be stained \r\nby osmic acid, though asphyxia would more directly affect the disulfide \r\ngroups. The increased staining with silver in asphyxia similarly suggests \r\nan increase in sulfhydryls. Freezing \r\ncells, and then fracturing them and coating the fragments with metal \r\nor carbon is often used to \"demonstrate the lipid bilayer,\" \r\n\r\nso it is interesting that theosmium compound that \"reveals\" \r\nthe lipid bilayer for the electron microscope destroys the apparent \r\nmembrane in the freezing technique.(R. James and D. Branton, \"The \r\ncorrelation between the saturation of membrane fatty acids and the presence \r\nof membrane fracture faces after osmium fixation,\" Biochim. Biophys. \r\nActa 233, 504-512, 1971; M. V. Nermut and B. J. Ward,\"Effect \r\nof fixatives on fracture plane in red blood cells,\" J. Microsc. \r\n102, 29-39, 1974.) So, \r\nwhen someone says \"we need the essential fatty acids to make cell \r\nmembranes,\" my response is likely to be \"no, we don't, and \r\nlife probably originated on hot lava and has never needed lipid membranes.\" On \r\nthe third argument, that vegetable oils can be used therapeutically, \r\nI am likely to say yes, they do have some drug-like actions, for example, \r\nlinseed oil has been used as a purgative, but as with any drug you should \r\nmake sure that the side effects are going to be acceptable to you. Currently, \r\nit is popular to recommend polyunsaturated oils to treat eczema and \r\npsoriasis. These oils are immunosuppressive, so it is reasonable to \r\nthink that there might be some pleasant consequences if a certain immunological \r\nprocess is suppressed, but they are also intimately involved with inflammation, \r\nsensitivity to ultraviolet light, and many other undesirable things. \r\nThe traditional use of coal tar and ultraviolet light was helpful in \r\nsuppressing eczema and psoriasis, but its tendency to cause cancer has \r\nled many people to forego its benefits to protect their health. If \r\nyou want to use a polyunsaturated oil as a drug, it is worthwhile to \r\nremember that the \"essential fatty acids\" suppress metabolism \r\nand promote obesity; are immunosuppressive; cause inflammation and shock; \r\nare required for alcoholic liver cirrhosis; sensitize to radiation damage; \r\naccelerate formation of aging pigment, cataracts, retinal degeneration; \r\npromote free radical damage and excitoxicity; cause cancer and accelerate \r\nits growth; are toxic to the heart muscle and promote atherosclerosis; \r\ncan cause brain edema, diabetes, excessive vascular permeability, precocious \r\npuberty, progesterone deficiency, skin wrinkling and other signs of \r\naging. Whether \r\nany of the claimed pharmaceutical uses of the polyunsaturated oils, \r\nbesides purgation, turn out to be scientifically valid remains to be \r\nseen. The theoretical bases often used to back up the claimed benefits \r\nare confused or false, or both. People \r\nwho are willing to question the validity of an \"orthodox method,\" \r\nsuch as the glass microelectrode, are in a position to make observations \r\nthat were \"forbidden\" by the method and its surrounding ideology. \r\n(See Davis, et al., 1970.) Their perception is freed in ways that could \r\nlead to new understanding and practical solutions to old problems. But \r\nsometimes experiments seem to be designed as advertising, rather than \r\nscience. Recent studies of the effects of fish oils on night vision \r\nor development of the retina, for example, seem to forget that fish \r\noil contains vitamin A, and that vitamin A has the effects that are \r\nbeing ascribed to the unsaturated fatty acids. With \r\nthe financial cutbacks in university libraries, there is a risk that \r\nthe giant seed-oil organizations will succeed in using governmental \r\npower to regulate the alternative communication of scientific information, \r\nallowing them to control both public and \"scientific\" opinion \r\nmore completely than they do now.

        "chunk_html": "Multiple sclerosis, protein, fats, and progesterone============================================== We \r\nare always subjected to antigenic burdens. The important question has \r\nto do with our ability to limit the inflammatory response to these burdens. In \r\nMS, it is clear that the inflammatory process itself is destructive, \r\nand that estrogen is a major predisposing factor. Unsaturated fatty \r\nacids, and dietary imbalance of amino acids interact closely with hyperestrogenism \r\nand hypothyroidism to produce the autoimmune degenerative diseases. Reduction \r\nof the mediators of inflammation is better than augmenting a single \r\nantiinflammatory agent such as cortisol. Although immunosuppressive \r\ndrugs, including the \"essential fatty acids,\" do alleviate \r\ninflammatory symptoms temporarily, they probably contribute to the underlying \r\npathology. People \r\nwith MS have chronically increased production of cortisol. This creates \r\na distortion of protein assimilation, resembling a nutritional protein \r\ndeficiency. Excessive serotonin and estrogen cause a relatively uncontrolled \r\nproduction of cortisol. A vicious circle of inflammatory mediators and \r\namino acid imbalance can result. Depression, \r\nlupus, migraine, menopause, diabetes, and aging have several important \r\nmetabolic features in common with MS. Popular \r\ntherapies are illogical, and are likely to cause disease progression. High \r\nquality protein, thyroid, pregnenolone and progesterone tend to correct \r\nthe underlying pathology. These are antiinflammatory, but they are not \r\nimmunosuppressive or catabolic. High \r\naltitude and sunny climate are associated with a low incidence of MS. ============================================== Multiple \r\nsclerosis (MS), like other autoimmune diseases, affects women more often \r\nthan men (about 2 to 1), has its onset during the reproductive years \r\n(especially after the age of 30, when estrogen is very high), is often \r\nexacerbated premenstrually, and is sometimes alleviated by pregnancy \r\n(Drew and Chavez, 2000), when progesterone is very high. Women with \r\na high ratio of estrogen to progesterone have been found to have the \r\nmost active brain lesions (Bansil, et al., 1999). Most of the mediators \r\nof inflammation that are involved in MS--mast cells, nitric oxide (NO), \r\nserotonin, prolactin, lipid peroxidation, free fatty acids, prostaglandins \r\nand isoprostanes, and the various cytokines (IL, TNF)--are closely associated \r\nwith estrogen's actions, and in animals, autoimmune diseases can be \r\nbrought on by treatment with estrogen (Ahmed and Talal). The \r\nstrong association of MS with estrogen has led to an illogical, but \r\npopular and well-publicized medical conclusion that estrogen is protective \r\nagainst MS, and some have claimed that estrogen has beneficial therapeutic \r\neffects. This strange way of thinking has its equivalent in the idea \r\nthat, since women are much more likely than men to develop Alzheimer's \r\ndisease, estrogen is protective against it; or that, since women have \r\nmore fragile bones than men do, and their progressive bone loss occurs \r\nduring the times of their greatest exposure to estrogen, estrogen prevents \r\nosteoporosis. In \r\nthis medical environment, close associations between estrogen and degenerative \r\ndiseases are acknowledged, but they are given a meaning contrary to \r\ncommon sense by saying that the association occurs because there isn't \r\nenough estrogen. The stove burns you because it isn't hot enough. As \r\nDave Barry would say, I'm not making this up. Recently well publicized \r\narticles have suggested that estrogen protects the brain (even against \r\nstroke!) because it increases serotonin and NO. There is something almost \r\nesthetically pleasing when so many major errors are concentrated into \r\na single article. Nitric oxide and serotonin are both neurotoxic (Joseph, \r\net al., 1991; Skaper, et al., 1996; Parkinson, et al., 1997; Santiago, \r\net al., 1998; Barger, et al., 2000), as a result of suppressing mitochondrial \r\nrespiration. NO plays a major role in lipid peroxidation and demyelination. \r\nIt's interesting to see serotonin and NO openly associated with estrogen, \r\nwhose mitochondrial toxicity has been carefully hidden from public view. There \r\nare several theories about the cause of MS, old theories about genes \r\nand viruses, and newer theories about bacteria, vitamin deficiencies, \r\noil deficiencies, poisons, and reactions to vaccinations (especially \r\nfor hepatitis B and influenza). The only theory that has been abandoned \r\nis the 19th century psychiatric theory about \"hysterical paralysis,\" \r\n\r\nthough occasionally someone does still talk about emotional causes of \r\nmultiple sclerosis; the term \"female hysteria\" has evolved \r\ninto \"conversion disorder.\" Each \r\nof the main theories has a few facts that seem to support it, but neglects \r\nto account for many other facts. Everyone agrees that the immune system \r\nis involved in MS in some way, but that's really where the problem starts, \r\nbecause of the idea that inflammation is an intrinsic part of immunity. \r\nIf \"inflammation is necessary and good,\" then it becomes a \r\nproblem to define exactly where the boundary is between an appropriate \r\nreaction and a degenerative process. Edema, reduced cellular respiration, \r\nloss of normal functions, fibrosis in its various degrees, each component \r\nof inflammation can be seen in a good light, as part of a \"defensive \r\nimmune reaction.\" When tissue injury leads to repair, it \"must\" \r\n\r\nbe seen as beneficial, even if it leads to the formation of a scar in \r\nplace of functional tissue, because the comparison is between an imagined \r\nworst possible outcome, and an imperfect recovery, rather than comparing \r\nthe inflammatory process with the possibility that a potentially noxious \r\nagent might have done no harm at all. The \r\nsimplest illustration of how inflammation relates to the organism's \r\nresources was an experiment in which blood glucose was varied, while \r\nan animal was exposed to chemicals that varied from mildly irritating \r\nto potentially deadly. When the animal had very low blood sugar, the \r\nmildest irritant could be deadly, but when its blood glucose was kept \r\nvery high, even the deadly antigens were only mildly irritating. Varying \r\nthe blood sodium concentration had similar, but weaker, effects. There \r\nis a tendency to see inflammation not only as a normal part of immunity, \r\nbut to see it as being proportional to the nature of the antigen, except \r\nwhen the immune system has been primed for it by previous contact, in \r\nwhich case the organism will either not react at all (because it has \r\nbecome immune), or it will react much more violently than it did on \r\nthe first exposure, because it has become allergic. But, in reality, \r\nthe mere concentration of glucose and sodium in the blood (and of thyroid, \r\nand many other substances that aren't considered to be part of the immune \r\nsystem) can make a tremendous difference in the degree of \"immunological\" \r\nreaction. In \r\nthe excessively sensitive condition produced by hypoglycemia, several \r\nthings happen that contribute to the maladaptive exaggerated inflammatory \r\nresponse. Adrenaline \r\nincreases in hypoglycemia, and, if the adrenaline fails to convert glycogen \r\ninto glucose, it will provide an alternative fuel by liberating free \r\nfatty acids from fat cells. If \r\nthe liberated fatty acids are unsaturated, they will cause serotonin \r\nto be secreted, and both serotonin and the unsaturated fatty acids will \r\nsuppress mitochondrial respiration, exacerbating the hypoglycemia. They \r\nwill stimulate the release of cytokines, activating a variety of immunological \r\nand inflammatory processes, and they will cause blood vessels to become \r\nleaky, creating edema and starting the first stages of fibrosis. Both \r\nadrenaline and serotonin will stimulate the release of cortisol, which \r\nmobilizes amino acids from tissues such as the large skeletal muscles. \r\nThose muscles contain a large amount of cysteine and tryptophan, which, \r\namong other effects, suppress the thyroid. The increased tryptophan, \r\nespecially in the presence of free fatty acids, is likely to be converted \r\ninto additional serotonin, since fatty acids release tryptophan from \r\nalbumin, increasing its entry into the brain. Free fatty acids and increased \r\nserotonin reduce metabolic efficiency (leading to insulin resistance, \r\nfor example) and promote an inflammatory state. Fats \r\nin the blood-stream have easy access to the brain, and the unsaturated \r\nfree fatty acids produce brain edema (Chan, et al., 1983, 1988).  \r\nWhen brain edema is caused by vascular leakage, proteins that are normally \r\nexcluded can enter. The stimulated, excited and fatigued brain exchanges \r\nglutamine for tryptophan, accelerating its uptake from the blood. When \r\na tissue is injured or stressed, antibodies are formed in response to \r\nthe altered components of that tissue. Therefore, we could call a bruise \r\nor a sprain an autoimmune condition, but there are no commercial tests \r\nfor bruised-shin antibodies. The availability of tests for specific \r\nantibodies seems to be the essential factor in classifying a condition \r\nas autoimmune, as in \"autoimmune thyroiditis.\" Unfortunately, \r\nthis way of using language is nested in a culture that is full of unrealistic \r\nideas of causality, and thousands of people build their careers on the \r\nsearch for the \"mutated genes that are responsible for the disease,\" \r\nand for the drugs that will correct the defect. Early \r\nin the study of immunology, the focus was on antibodies. Even earlier, \r\ninflammation had been conceptualized in terms of the \"humors,\" \r\n\r\nand other prescientific ideas. As soon as multiple sclerosis/hysterical \r\nparalysis was classified as an autoimmune disease, primitive ideas about \r\nthe nature of the immune system, interacting with primitive ideas about \r\nthe nature of the brain and the structure of cells, blended into the \r\nvarious theories of what the disease is. Rather \r\nthan seeing immunological nerve damage as the cause of all the other \r\nfeatures of multiple sclerosis, I think it's important to look at some \r\nof the general features of the condition, as contexts in which to interpret \r\nthe events in the nerves. It \r\nhas been known for a long time that the incidence of MS tends to increase \r\nwith distance from the equator. Incidence is low in sunny dry climates, \r\nand at high altitudes. Two clear dietary influences have been found: \r\neating pork, and horsemeat. People \r\nwith MS don't regulate their body temperature very well. Their nerve \r\nconduction is slow, and in normal people, conduction is faster at higher \r\ntemperatures, but in people with MS the conduction is slower at the \r\nnormal temperature of 98.6O F than at lower temperatures. A subnormal \r\ntemperature is also associated with old age, and with the hot flashes \r\nof menopause. Brain \r\nmetabolism of glucose is very low in multiple sclerosis, and in my own \r\nobservations, the general metabolic rate is subnormal. However, some \r\npeople reason that the hypometabolism is caused by the lesions, rather \r\nthan vice versa. Animals \r\nthat lack the unsaturated fatty acids have a higher metabolic rate and \r\nability to use glucose, converting it to CO2 more readily, have a greater \r\nresistance to toxins (Harris, et al., 1990; even cobra venom: Morganroth, \r\net al., 1989), including endotoxin (Li, et al., 1990)--preventing excessive \r\nvascular leakage--and to immunological damage (Takahashi, et al., 1992), \r\nand to trauma, and their neuromuscular response is accelerated while \r\nfast twitch muscles are less easily fatigued (Ayre and Hulber, 1996). In \r\npeople with MS, the blood is more viscous, and the platelets tend to \r\nclump together more easily. Their cortisol level is higher than normal, \r\nand their pituitary adrenal-cortex-stimulating hormone is harder to \r\nsuppress. This is a condition that is also seen in depression and old \r\nage. Despite the chronically elevated cortisol, people with MS typically \r\nhave hypoglycemia. They are occasionally found to have low blood sodium, \r\nhyponatremia, but this is hard to determine when the blood's water content \r\nis variable. Their prolactin is likely to be high, and this can result \r\nfrom high estrogen, high serotonin, low sodium, or low thyroid. Drinking \r\ntoo much water can increase prolactin, and can damage the nerves' myelin \r\nenclosures; too much serotonin tends to cause excessive drinking. Disturbances \r\nof blood glucose, sodium, and water content can disrupt the brain's \r\nmyelin structure. High estrogen disturbs the blood osmotically, making \r\nit retain too much water in relation to the solutes, and this relates \r\nto many of estrogen's effects; since simple osmotic variations can damage \r\nthe myelin structures, it seems that this mechanism should be investigated \r\nthoroughly before it is assumed that the immunological events are primary. Mast \r\ncells, which promote inflammation by releasing substances such as histamine \r\nand serotonin (and make blood vessels leaky), are more numerous in the \r\nbrain in multiple sclerosis than in normal brains. Since platelet clumping \r\nreleases serotonin, and also because serotonin excess is suggested by \r\nso many other features of MS, serotonin antagonists (ondansetron and \r\nketanserin, for example) have been used therapeutically with success. Estrogen \r\ncauses mast cells to release their inflammatory mediators, and it causes \r\nplatelets to aggregate, releasing their serotonin. Since estrogen dominance \r\nis closely associated with the presence of active brain lesions, antiestrogen \r\ntherapy would seem obvious in MS. Progesterone counteracts estrogen's \r\neffects on both mast cells and platelets. Aspirin \r\nprotects against a variety of inflammatory processes, but it's most \r\nfamous for the inhibition of prostaglandins. While aspirin is often \r\nused to relieve pain in MS, and another inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, \r\nindomethacin, has been used therapeutically in MS, it would seem appropriate \r\nto investigate more carefully aspirin's possible role in preventing \r\nor relieving MS. A \r\nsimple protein deficiency has many surprising effects. It lowers body \r\ntemperature, and suppresses the thyroid, but it increases inflammation \r\nand the tendency of blood to clot. Since the brain and heart and lungs \r\nrequire a continuous supply of essential amino acids if they are to \r\ncontinue functioning, in the absence of dietary protein, cortisol must \r\nbe produced continuously to mobilize amino acids from the expendable \r\ntissues, which are mainly the skeletal muscles. These muscles have a \r\nhigh concentration of tryptophan and cysteine, which suppress the thyroid. \r\nCysteine is excitoxic, and tryptophan is the precursor for serotonin. \r\nPresumably, their presence in, and stress-induced release from, the \r\nmuscles is one of the mechanisms that reduce metabolic activity during \r\ncertain types of stress. When \r\npregnant animals are deprived of protein, the newborn animals have abnormally \r\nhigh levels of serotonin, and the enzymes responsible for that excess \r\ntend to maintain the serotonin excess even when they are grown and have \r\nadequate protein. This is analogous to the effect of excess estrogen \r\nearly in life, which creates a tendency to develop breast or prostate \r\ncancer in adulthood. It would be interesting to study the gestational \r\nexperience, e.g., length of gestation and birth weight, of the people \r\nwho later develop MS. Although \r\npeople in the northern countries aren't normally protein-starved, they \r\ndo tend to get a large part of their protein from the muscle meats. \r\nIn traditional cultures, all parts of the food animals were eaten--chicken \r\nfeet, heads, and necks, animals' ears and eyeballs, etc.--and so the \r\namino acid balance was favorable for maintaining a high metabolic rate \r\nand preventing stress. The \r\nobservation that multiple sclerosis is associated with the consumption \r\nof pork and horsemeat, but not beef, lamb, or goat, is very interesting, \r\nsince the fat of those animals is essentially like the fats of the plant \r\nmaterials that they eat, meaning that it is extremely high in linoleic \r\nand linolenic acids. The rumen of cows, sheep, and goats contains bacteria \r\nthat convert the polyunsaturated fats into more saturated fats. Unsaturated \r\nfats inhibit the enzymes that digest protein, and MS patients have been \r\nreported to have poor digestion of meat (Gupta, et al., 1977). The \r\npolyunsaturated fats are in themselves toxic to mitochondria, and suppress \r\nglucose oxidation, and inhibit the thyroid function, with the same suppressive \r\neffect on the ability to oxidize glucose, but they are also turned, \r\nenzymically, into the prostaglandins, and non-enzymically, by spontaneous \r\nlipid peroxidation, into the toxic isoprostanes. The isoprostanes, and \r\nsome of the prostaglandins, are elevated in the brain and other tissues \r\nof people with MS. Lipid \r\nperoxidation is very high in multiple sclerosis. Nitric oxide (whose \r\nsynthesis is promoted by estrogen in most parts of the brain) is a free \r\nradical that activates peroxidation. Lipid \r\nperoxidation selectively destroys, naturally, the unstable polyunsaturated \r\nfats. In atherosclerosis, the blood vessel plaques contain very little \r\nunsaturated fat. This is because they are peroxidized so rapidly, but \r\ntheir high ratio of saturated to unsaturated fats has been used to argue \r\nthat the polyunsaturated oils are \"heart protective.\" Similar \r\narguments are often made in MS, though some studies don't support the \r\nidea that there is a lack of any of the unsaturated fats. Since lipid \r\nperoxidation is very high, it would be reasonable to assume that there \r\nwas an abundance of polyunsaturated fats being peroxidized through reactions \r\nwith catalysts such as iron (S.M. LeVine, 1997) and nitric oxide and \r\nperoxynitrile. I \r\nbelieve that an important aspect of the intolerance for heat so often \r\nreported in people with MS could be the tendency of relative hyperthermia \r\nto release increased amounts of free fatty acids into the blood stream. \r\nWomen, because of estrogen's effects, usually have much higher levels \r\nof free fatty acids in the blood than men do. Estrogen increases the \r\nrelease of free fatty acids from stored fat, and the unsaturated fats \r\nsynergize with both estrogen and prolactin, increasing their effects. Temperature \r\nregulation apparently involves some nerve cells that sense temperature \r\nvery accurately, and change their activity accordingly. Water has a \r\nremarkably high heat capacity, meaning that it takes a relatively large \r\namount of heat to change its temperature. The \"disappearing heat\" \r\nis being consumed by structural changes in the water. Proteins have \r\nthe same sort of structural complexity as water, and together they can \r\nmake effective temperature transducers, \"thermometers.\" (Other \r\nsubstances tend to undergo major structural changes only as they melt \r\nor vaporize. The famous \"liquid crystals\" have a few distinct \r\nstructural phases, but cytoplasm is like a very subtle liquid crystal.)  \r\nThe \"thermostat cells\" are actually responding to a degree \r\nof internal structure, not to the temperature in the abstract. So things \r\nthat change their internal structure will modify their temperature \"set-point.\" Increased \r\nestrogen causes an animal to lower its temperature, and it probably \r\ndoes this by increasing the \"structural temperature\" of the \r\nthermostat cells, \"melting\" their internal structure. Progesterone \r\ncauses the animal to increase its temperature, and it apparently does \r\nthis by increasing the structure/decreasing the structural temperature \r\nof the thermostat cells. If you put ice in the thermostat, the room \r\ngets hot. A \r\ncell's internal structure is equivalent to its readiness to work. Fatigue \r\nrepresents a slightly \"melted\" state of the cell, in which \r\nstructure appears to have been consumed along with the chemical energy \r\nreserves. Experiments that demonstrated this effect were very clear, \r\nbut they were ignored because they didn't fit people's stereotyped idea \r\nof the cell. With a very sensitive thermometer, it's possible to measure \r\nthe heat produced by a nerve when it is stimulated. That's not surprising. \r\nBut it's surprising that, when the nerve is recovering from the stimulation, \r\nit absorbs heat from its environment, lowering the temperature locally. \r\nThat even violated some people's conception of \"entropy,\" \r\n\r\nbut it can easily be demonstrated that changing the form of some materials \r\nchanges their heat capacity, as when a rubber band is stretched (it \r\ngets hot), or contracts (it gets cooler). The \r\nexcitants, estrogen and cortisol, slow the conduction of nerves, because \r\nthey cause its internal structure to be dissipated. They create a \"pre-fatigued\" \r\nstate in the cell. In \r\nexperiments with rabbit hearts, Szent-Gyorgyi showed that estrogen decreased \r\nthe heart's readiness to work, and that progesterone increased its readiness \r\nto work, and he said it did this by \"building structure.\" \r\nHe pointed out that, for a given drug or other stimulus, cells have \r\na characteristic response, becoming either more activated or more inhibited, \r\nbut he showed that, outside the normal concentration or intensity range \r\nof the stimulus, a cell's response is often reversed. If \r\nthis is the situation in the nerves in MS, it explains the strange behavior, \r\nin which warming the nerve reduces its function. The implication is \r\nthat internal structure (and energy) must be restored to the nerves. \r\nIn experiments that I have described in previous newsletters, increasing \r\nsodium, ATP, carbon dioxide, and progesterone, and increasing the ratio \r\nof magnesium to calcium, have been found to increase cellular energy \r\nand structure. The thyroid hormone is ultimately responsible for maintaining \r\ncells' energy and structure, and responsiveness, but if it is increased \r\nsuddenly without allowing all the other factors to adjust, it will raise \r\nthe temperature too suddenly. It needn't take a long time, but all the \r\nfactors have to be present at the same time. Serotonin, \r\nmelatonin, estrogen, and polyunsaturated fats all tend to lower body \r\ntemperature. Since estrogen and the unsaturated fats are cellular excitants, \r\nthe actual decrease in body temperature helps to offset their excitatory \r\neffects. Both \r\nbright light and high altitude tend to reduce serotonin's effects. The \r\ntissue carbon dioxide retained at high altitude reduces the incidence \r\nof many diseases, and multiple sclerosis might be affected as heart \r\ndisease and cancer are. It is known that carbon dioxide is involved \r\nin myelin's regulation of its own water content. Hyperventilation, by \r\ncausing a loss of carbon dioxide, releases both histamine and serotonin, \r\nmaking blood more viscous, while making blood vessels more permeable, \r\nand causing them to constrict. If \r\npeople with MS have developed it through the interactions of excessive \r\nestrogen, serotonin, unsaturated fats, iron, and water, and deficient \r\nthyroid, and deficient pregnenolone produced in the myelin-forming cells \r\n(oligodendrocytes), there are many things that can be done to stop its \r\nprogress, and possibly to reverse it. Since \r\na sudden increase in temperature will release increased amounts of the \r\npro-inflammatory fats, things should be changed gradually. Increased \r\nsalt is thermogenic, but increased magnesium is protective against hyperthermia, \r\nso increased magnesium (epsom salts baths, for example, coffee, fruits, \r\nsome vegetables and meats) would be helpful. Magnesium is rapidly lost \r\nfrom cells in hypothyroidism. Sugar, when accompanied by fats and minerals, \r\nas in milk, is needed to lower cortisol, and to maintain thyroid activity. \r\nBalanced proteins, such as cheese, potatoes, eggs, and beef- or lamb-broth \r\n(for the gelatin and mineral content in particular) will prevent the \r\ntryptophan excess that suppresses the thyroid and is potentially a nerve \r\ntoxin. Saturated fats, used regularly, reduce the immediate toxic antimetabolic \r\neffects of the stored unsaturated fats, but it takes a long time to \r\nchange the balance of stored fats. Since \r\naspirin lowers temperature, is antiinflammatory, in some situations \r\nantiestrogenic, and is a powerful antioxidant, it is likely that it \r\nwould alleviate symptoms and prevent progression of MS, as it does in \r\nother degenerative diseases. Since platelet aggregation is likely to \r\nbe involved in the focuses of inflammation, aspirin might help to prevent \r\nthe formation of new areas of damage. While \r\nthe glucocorticoids are useful for their antiinflammatory actions, cortisol \r\nis known to promote the killing of brain cells by excitotoxicity. Since \r\nestrogen decreases GABA, and both estrogen and serotonin activate the \r\nexcitatory amino acid transmitters, the addition of synthetic glucocorticoids \r\nto the pre-existing cortisol excess is likely to damage parts of the \r\nbrain in addition to the inflamed areas. The \r\nexcess cortisol of depression, old age, and hyperestrogenism often comes \r\ndown with use of a thyroid supplement, but pregnenolone has a very direct \r\naction (in opposition to serotonin) that can quiet the pituitary, reducing \r\nACTH and cortisol. Progesterone has some similar effects, and is protective \r\nagainst excess cortisol, and is a major factor in nerve and brain restoration. \r\nThyroid, progesterone, and pregnenolone are all involved in the formation \r\nof new myelin, and in the prevention of the edema that damages it. Since \r\nthyroid and progesterone decrease the formation of estrogen in inflamed \r\ntissue, while cortisol stimulates its formation, it would seem wise \r\nto use thyroid and progesterone for their immediate antiinflammatory \r\neffects, which include the inhibition of NO formation (Drew and Chavez, \r\n2000), and their lack of the excitotoxic, estrogen-stimulating effects \r\nof the glucocorticoids.  While the glucocorticoids are catabolic \r\nand liberate cysteine and tryptophan from muscles, thyroid and progesterone \r\nare not catabolic, and protect against the toxic consequences of those \r\namino acids.

Effects of changes in dietary fatty \r\nacids on isolated skeletal muscle functions in rats. Ayre KJ, Hulbert \r\nAJ  The effects of manipulating dietary levels of essential polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids on the function of isolated skeletal muscles in male Wistar \r\nrats were examined. Three isoenergetic diets were used: an essential \r\nfatty acid-deficient diet (EFAD), a diet high in essential (n-6) fatty \r\nacids [High (n-6)], and a diet enriched with essential (n-3) fatty acids \r\n[High (n-3)]. After 9 wk, groups of rats on each test diet were fed \r\na stock diet of laboratory chow for a further 6 wk. Muscle function \r\nwas examined by using a battery of five tests for soleus (slow twitch) \r\nand extensor digitorum longus (EDL; fast twitch). Tests included single \r\nmuscle twitches, sustained tetanic contractions, posttetanic potentiation, \r\nsustained high-frequency stimulation, and intermittent low-frequency \r\nstimulation. Results for muscles from the High (n-6) and High (n-3) \r\ngroups were very similar. However, the EFAD diet resulted in significantly \r\nlower muscular tensions and reduced response times compared with the \r\nHigh (n-6) and High (n-3) diets. Peak twitch tension in soleus muscles \r\nwas 16-21% less in the EFAD group than in the High (n-6) and High (n-3) \r\ngroups, respectively [analysis of variance (ANOVA), P < 0.01). During \r\nhigh-frequency stimulation, EDL muscles from the EFAD rats fatigued \r\n32% more quickly (ANOVA, P < 0.01)]. Also, twitch contraction and \r\nhalf-relaxation times were significantly 5-7% reduced in the EFAD group \r\n(ANOVA, P < 0.01). During intermittent low-frequency stimulation, \r\nsoleus muscles from the EFAD group generated 25-28% less tension than \r\ndid the other groups (ANOVA, P < 0.01), but in EDL muscles from the \r\nEFAD group, endurance was 20% greater than in the High (n-6) group (ANOVA, \r\nP < 0.05). After 6 wk on the stock diet, there were no longer any \r\ndifferences between the dietary groups. Manipulation of dietary fatty \r\nacids results in significant, but reversible, effects in muscles of \r\nrats fed an EFAD diet. Endocr \r\nRes 1999 May;25(2):207-14.

Fatty acids, fibrinogen and \r\nblood flow: a general mechanism for hyperfibrinogenemia and its pathologic \r\nconsequences. Pickart LR, Thaler MM Plasma fibrinogen is elevated in \r\nvarious stressful states and conditions in which active mobilization \r\nof free fatty acids (FFA) occurs. Reduction of plasma FFA by an assortment \r\nof hypolipidemic drugs is consistently followed by a decrease in the \r\naccompanying hyperfibrinogenemia. A direct link between FFA and fibrinogen \r\nhas been demonstrated in animals, and in experiments employing incubated \r\nliver slices. Based on these clinical and experimental observations, \r\nwe postulate that hepatic fibrinogen synthesis is stimulated by FFA. \r\nSince fibrinogen is a major determinant of whole blood viscosity, erythrocyte \r\naggregation, and sludging of red cells in terminal and pre-terminal \r\nblood vessels, we propose that microcirculatory blood flow may be impaired \r\nin the presence of chronically elevated plasma FFA levls. Consequently, \r\nhypolipidemic drugs may be effective in prevention of circulatory complications \r\nassociated with FFA-induced hyperfibrinogenemia. Neurologia \r\n1996 Aug-Sep;11(7):272.

Since it was \nnecessary for fertility and for maintaining a healthy pregnancy, it \nwas called the pro-gestational hormone, and its name sometimes \nleads people to think that it isn't needed when you don't want to get \npregnant. In fact, it is the most protective hormone the body produces, \nand the large amounts that are produced during pregnancy result from \nthe developing baby's need for protection from the stressful environment. \nNormally, the brain contains a very high concentration of progesterone, \nreflecting its protective function for that most important organ. The \nthymus gland, the key organ of our immune system, is also profoundly \ndependent of progesterone. In experiments, progesterone \nwas found to be the basic hormone of adaptation and of resistance to \nstress. The adrenal glands use it to produce their antistress hormones, \nand when there is enough progesterone, they don't have to produce the \npotentially harmful cortisol. In a progesterone deficiency, we produce \ntoo much cortisol, and excessive cortisol causes osteoporosis, aging \nof the skin, damage to brain cells, and the accumulation of fat, especially \non the back and abdomen. Experiments have shown that \nprogesterone relieves anxiety, improves memory, protects brain cells, \nand even prevents epileptic seizures. It promotes respiration, and has \nbeen used to correct emphysema. In the circulatory system, it prevents \nbulging veins by increasing the tone of blood vessels, and improves \nthe efficiency of the heart. It reverses many of the signs of aging \nin the skin, and promotes healthy bone growth. It can relieve many types \nof arthritis, and helps a variety of immunological problems. If progesterone is taken dissolved \nin vitamin E, it is absorbed very efficiently, and distributed quickly \nto all of the tissues. If a woman has ovaries, progesterone helps them \nto regulate themselves and their hormone production. It helps to restore \nnormal functioning of the thyroid and other glands. If her ovaries have \nbeen removed, progesterone should be taken consistently to replace the \nlost supply. A progesterone deficiency has often been associated with \nincreased susceptibility to cancer, and progesterone has been used to \ntreat some types of cancer. It is important to emphasize \nthat progesterone is not just the hormone of pregnancy. To use it only \nto protect the uterus would be like telling a man he doesn't need \ntestosterone if he doesn't plan to father children, except that progesterone \nis of far greater and more basic physiological significance than testosterone. \nWhile men do naturally produce progesterone, and can sometimes benefit \nfrom using it, it is not a male hormone. Some people get that impression, \nbecause some physicians recommend combining estrogen with either testosterone \nor progesterone, to protect against some of estrogen's side effects, \nbut progesterone is the body's natural complement to estrogen. Used \nalone, progesterone often makes it unnecessary to use estrogen for hot \nflashes or insomnia, or other symptoms of menopause. When dissolved in vitamin E, \nprogesterone begins entering the blood stream almost as soon as it contacts \nany membrane, such as the lips, tongue, gums, or palate, but when it \nis swallowed, it continues to be absorbed as part of the digestive process. \nWhen taken with food, its absorption occurs at the same rate as the \ndigestion and absorption of the food. PROGESTERONE SUPPLEMENTATION SYMPTOMATIC: For tendonitis, \nbursitis, arthritis, sunburn, etc., progesterone in vitamin E can be \napplied locally after a little olive oil has been put on the skin to \nmake it easier to spread the progesterone solution. For migraines, it \nhas been taken orally just as the symptoms begin. FOR PMS: The normal pattern \nof progesterone secretion during the month is for the ovaries to produce \na large amount in the 2ndtwo weeks of the menstrual cycle, \n(i.e., day 14 through day 28) beginning at ovulation and ending around \nthe beginning of menstruation, and then to produce little for the following \ntwo weeks. An average person produces about 30 milligrams daily during \nthe 2ndtwo weeks. The solution I have used contains approximately \n3 or 4 milligrams of progesterone per small drop. Three to four drops, \nor about 10 to 15 milligrams of progesterone, is often enough to bring \nthe progesterone level up to normal. That amount can be taken days 14 \nthrough 28 of the menstrual cycle; this amount may be repeated once \nor twice during the day as needed to alleviate symptoms. Since an essential \nmechanism of progesterone's action involves its opposition to estrogen, \nsmaller amounts are effective when estrogen production is low, and if \nestrogen is extremely high, even large supplements of progesterone will \nhave no clear effect; in that case, it is essential to regulate estrogen \nmetabolism, by improving the diet, correcting a thyroid deficiency, \netc. (Unsaturated fat is antithyroid and synergizes with estrogen.) PERIMENOPAUSAL: The symptoms \nand body changes leading up to menopause are associated with decreasing \nproduction of progesterone, at a time when estrogen may be at a lifetime \nhigh. The cyclic use of progesterone, two weeks on, two weeks off, will \noften keep the normal menstrual cycle going. Three to our drops, providing \nten or twelve milligrams of progesterone, is typical for a day, but \nsome women prefer to repeat that amount. Progesterone is always more \neffective when the diet contains adequate protein, and when thee isn't \nan excessive amount of unsaturated fat in the diet.. POSTMENOPAUSAL: Some women \ncontinue the cyclic use of progesterone ater menopause, because the \npituitary gland and brain may continue to cycle long after menstruation \nhas stopped, and progesterone is an important regulator of pituitary \nand brain function. The cycling pituitary affects the adrenal glands \nand other organs, and progesterone tends to protect against the unopposed \nactions of prolactin, cortisol, and adrenal androgenic hormones. Progesterone's \neffects on the pituitary apparently contribute to its protective effect \nagainst osteoporosis, hypertension, hirsutism, etc. But some women prefer \nto use progesterone without interruption after the menopause, for its \nprotective antistress effects. Slender people usually find that two \nor three drops are enough, but this amount may be repeated once or twice \nas needed to relieve symptoms. Adequate protein in the diet and good \nthyroid function help the body to produce its own progesterone; even \nif the ovaries have been removed, the adrenal glands and brain continue \nto produce progesterone. DOSAGE \nOF PROGESTERONE Since progesterone has none \nof the harmful side effects of other hormones (except for alteration \nof the menstrual cycle if it is taken at the wrong time of month), the \nbasic procedure should be to use it in sufficient quantity to make the \nsymptoms disappear, and to time its use so that menstrual cycles are \nnot disrupted. This normally means using it only between ovulation and \nmenstruation unless symptoms are sufficiently serious that a missed \nperiod is not important. The basic idea of giving enough to stop the \nsymptoms can be refined by some information on a few of the factors \nthat condition the need for progesterone. If a person has an enlarged \nthyroid gland, progesterone promotes secretion and unloading of the \nstored colloid, and can bring on a temporary hyperthyroid state. \nThis is a corrective process, and in itself isn't harmful. A thyroid \nsupplement should be used to shrink the goiter before progesterone is \ngiven. Normal amounts of progesterone facilitate thyroid secretion, \nwhile a deficiency, with unopposed estrogen, causes the thyroid to enlarge. \nThe production of euphoria has been mentioned as a side effect, but \nI think euphoria is simply an indication of a good physiological state. \n(The history of official medical attitudes toward euphoria is a subject \nthat deserves more attention.) Very large doses that are given in vitamin \nE solution, allowing complete absorption, can reach the level that is \nsometimes achieved late in pregnancy, producing both euphoria and a \ndegree of anesthesis. To avoid unexpected anesthesia, the correct dose \nshould be determined by taking about 10 mg. at a time allowing it to \nspread into the membranes of the mouth, and repeating the dose after \n10 minutes until the symptoms are controlled. An excessive estrogen/progesterone \nratio is more generally involved in producing or aggravating symptoms \nthan either a simple excess of estrogen or a deficiency of progesterone, \nbut even this ratio is conditioned by other factors, including age, \ndiet, other steroids, thyroid, and other hormones. The relative estrogen \nexcess seems to act by producing tissue hypoxia (as reported in my dissertation, \nUniversity of Oregon, 1972), and this is the result of changes induced \nby estrogen in alveolar diffusion, peripheral vascular changes, and \nintracellular oxygen wastage. Hypoxia in turn produces edema \n(as can be observed in the cornea when it is deprived of oxygen, as \nby a contact lens) and hypoglycemia (e.g., diminished ATP acts like \ninsulin), because glycolysis must increase greatly for even a small \ndeficiency of oxygen. Elevated blood lactic acid is one sign of tissue \nhypoxia. Edema, hypoglycemia, and lactic academia can also be produced \nby other respiratory defects, including hypothyroidism, in which \nthe tissue does not use enough oxygen. In hypoxia, the skin will be \nbluer (in thin places, such as around the eyes), than when low oxygen \nconsumption is the main problem. Low thyroid is one cause of excess \nestrogen, and when high estrogen is combined with low thyroid, the skin \nlooks relatively bloodless. Symptoms in cycling women are \nmost common around ovulation and in the premenstrual week, when the \nestrogen/progesterone ratio is normally highest. At puberty, in the \nearly twenties and in the late thirties and menopause are the ages when \nthe ratio is most often disturbed--and these are also the ages when \nthyroid disorders are commonest in women. The individual who suffers \nfrom one aspect of the progesterone (and/or thyroid) deficiency will \ntend to develop other problems at different times. With cyclic depressions \nor migraine headaches at age 22, there will possibly be breast disease \nlater, and often there will be problems with pregnancy. These people \nwith a history of sever symptoms are the ones most likely to have severe \nproblems around menopause. Prenatal exposure to poorly balanced hormones \nseems to predispose the child to later hormone problems. Excess stress (which can block \nprogesterone synthesis and elevate estrogen) may bring on symptoms in \nsomeone who never had them. Spending a summer in Alaska, with an unusually \nlong day, may relieve the symptoms of a chronic sufferer. Dark cloudy \nwinters in England or the Pacific Northwest are powerful stressors, \nand cause lower production of progesterone in women, and testosterone \nin men. Toxins can produce similar symptoms, as can nutritional deficiencies. \nA very common cause of an estrogen excess is a dietary protein deficiency--the \nliver simply cannot detoxify estrogen when it is under-nourished. With a diet high in protein \n(e.g., at least 70-100 grams per day, including eggs) and vitamin A \n(not carotene), I have found that the dose of progesterone can be reduced \neach month. Using thyroid will usually reduce the amount of progesterone \nneeded. Occasionally, a woman won't feel any effect even from 100 mg. \nof progesterone; I think this indicates that they need to use thyroid \nand diet, to normalize their estrogen, prolactin, and cortisol. Progesterone stimulates the \novaries and adrenals to produce progesterone, and it also activates \nthe thyroid, so one dose can sometimes have prolonged effects. It shouldn't \nbe necessary to keep using progesterone indefinitely, unless the ovaries \nhave been removed. In slender post-menopausal women, 10 mg. per day \nis usually enough to prevent progesterone deficiency symptoms. In a 10% solution of progesterone \nin vitamin E, one drop contains about three milligrams of progesterone. \nNormally, the body produces 10 to 20 milligrams per day. A dose of 3 \nor 4 drops usually brings the blood levels up to the normal range, but \nthis dose can be repeated several times during the day if it is needed \nto control symptoms. For general purposes, it is \nmost economical and effective to take progesterone dissolved in vitamin \nE orally, for example taking a few drops on the lips and tongue, or \nrubbing it into the gums. (It is good for the general health of the \ngums.) These membranes are very thin, and the progesterone quickly enters \nthe blood. When it is swallowed, the vitamin E allows it to be absorbed \nthrough the walls of the stomach and intestine, and it can be assimilated \nalong with food, in the chylomicrons, permitting it to circulate in \nthe blood to all of the organs before being processed by the liver. \nThese droplets are smaller than red blood cells, and some physicians \nseem to forget that red blood cells pass freely through the liver. For the topical treatment of \nsun damaged skin, or acne, wrinkles, etc. the oil can be applied directly \nto the affected area. © Ray Peat Ph.D. 2007. All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com",

        "chunk_html": "The Progesterone \nDeceptionsIn the 1930s, it was demonstrated \nthat estrogen, even in small doses, produced abortions, and that when \nit is given early enough, even a very small dose will prevent implantation \nof the fertilized embryo. Progesterone was known, by the early 1940s, \nto protect against the many toxic effects of estrogen, including abortion, \nbut it was also known as nature's contraceptive, since it can prevent \npregnancy without harmful side-effects, by different mechanisms, including \nprevention of sperm entry into the uterus. That is, progesterone prevents \nthe miscarriages which result from excess estrogen (1,2), but if used \nbefore intercourse, it prevents conception, and thus is a true contraceptive, \nwhile estrogen is an abortifacient, not a contraceptive.In the 1950s, there was a search \nfor chemicals which would prevent ovulation. According to Carl Djerassi \n(), drug companies were extremely reluctant to risk a religious backlash \nagainst their other products, and so hesitated to market contraceptives. \nObviously, the induction of monthly abortions would have been even harder \nto sell.According to Djerassi (3), \nUntil the middle 1940s ti was assumed that progesterone's biological \nactivity was extremely specific and that almost any alteration of the \nmolecule would diminish or abolish its activity. This would obviously \ndiscourage interest from the drug companies, who could patent a substance \nwhich they had chemically modified, but could not patent a simple natural \nsubstance. However, many substances--even non-steroidal chemicals--were \nknown to have estrogenic action. (4)By 1942, Hans Selye had demonstrated \nthat natural steroids retain their activity when administered orally. \nBut every drug company with a steroid patent had an obvious interest \nin having the public believe that there is a reason that the natural \nsteroids cannot be conveniently used. The doctrine that natural steroids \nare destroyed by stomach acid appeared, was promoted, and was accepted--without \nany supporting evidence. In the manufacture of progesterone, the precursor \nsteroid is boiled in hydrochloric acid to free it from its glucose residue. \nNo one seriously believed that stomach acid hurts progesterone, except \nthe public--and the doctors, who had seen the claim in their medical \njournals, and had heard it from drug salesmen.The myth stopped the use of \nthe cheap tablets of progesterone, as tablets of the synthetic progestins \ncame on the market, at a much higher price. Doctors who insisted on \nusing real progesterone were forced to buy it in an injectable form. \nAs a result, solubility became an issue. Progesterone is extremely insoluble \nin water, and, though it is vastly more soluble in vegetable oil than \nin water, it does not stay in solution at room temperature even at the \nlow concentration of 1 part in 1000 parts of a typical vegetable oil.When people speak of an allergy \nto progesterone (or even to penicillin) they generally are not aware \nof the presence of a very toxic solvent.(5) For a time, progesterone \nwas often sold dissolved in benzyl benzoate. The Physician's Desk Reference \nwarned of possible allergic reactions to progesterone. Now, it is supposedly \nsold dissolved in vegetable oil, with about 10% benzyl alcohol as--supposedly--a \nbacteriostatic agent.Bacteriostatic water contains \n0.9% to 1.9% benzyl alcohol, and can irreversibly harm nerves. (6,7) \nIts use in hospitals killed thousands of babies. Awareness of benzyl \nalcohol's toxicity goes back to 1918 at least; it was proposed as an \neffective insecticide, and was found to be toxic to many animal systems. \nThe safe systemic dose (7) is exceeded with an injection of 150 mg. \nof progesterone, yet the local concentration is far higher. It can cause \na severe reaction even when used at a lower concentration, in bacteriostatic \nwater. (5)Other alcohols, including ethanol, \nhave been used as solvents, but since they (ethanol even more than benzyl \nalcohol) have an affinity for water, the solution decomposes in contact \nwith tissue water.In spite of the toxicity of \nthe vehicle, several beneficial effects can be obtained with injected \nprogesterone, in serious conditions such as epilepsy or caner of the \nbreast or uterus. Many researchers have commented on the very obvious \ndifficulty of giving very large amounts of progesterone. (8) My comparisons \nof oral progesterone in tocopherol with other forms and methods of administration \nshow a roughly similar efficiency for oral and inject progesterone, \nand about 1/20 the effect for suppositories. Crystals of progesterone \nare visible in the suppositories I have examined, and this material \nis obviously wasted.An old theory of vitamin E's \nmechanism of action in improving fertility was that it spares progesterone.(9) \nIt is established that some of the effects of vitamin E and progesterone \nare similar, for example, both prevent oxygen waste and appear to improve \nmitochondrial coupling of phosphorylation with respiration. I suspected \nthat if they actually both work at the same mitochondrial site, then \nthey must have a high mutual solubility.Knowing the long-standing problem \nof administering large doses of progesterone without a toxic solvent, \nI applied for and was granted a patent for the composition of progesterone \nin tocopherol. One of my reasons for publishing in the form of patents \nis that I have had many years of experience in having my discoveries \ntaken up by others without acknowledgment, if they are compatible with \nconventional prejudices. Typically, an editor rejects a paper, and then \na few months later publishes a very similar paper by someone else. My \ndissertation research, which established that an estrogen excess kills \nthe embryo by suffocation, and that progesterone protects the embryo \nby promoting the delivery of both oxygen and glucose, didn't strike \na responsive chord in the journals which are heavily influenced by funds \nfrom the drug industry.According to a consultant for \na major medical journal, the idea of dissolving progesterone, \na fat soluble steroid hormone, in vitamin E which is then incorporated \ninto chylomicrons absorbed via the lymphatics, and thus avoids the liver \non the so called first pass is so simple it is amazing that the \npharmaceutical companies have not jumped on it. (A more sophisticated \nwriter might have said stomped on it.)In the powder form, direct \nand intimate contact with a mucous membrane allows lipid phase to lipid \nphase transfer of progesterone molecules. Instead of by-passing the \nliver, much of the progesterone is picked up in the portal circulation, \nwhere a major part of it is glucuronidated, and made water soluble for \nprompt excretion.Since this glucuronide form \ncross-reacts to some extent with the ordinary progesterone in the assay \nprocess, and since 50% of the ordinary free progesterone is carried \ninside the red blood cells (10,11), and 50% is associated with proteins \nin the plasma, while the glucuronide hardly enters the red blood cells \nat all, it is better to judge by clinical efficacy when comparing different \noral forms. My comparisons show several times higher potency in the \ntocopherol composition than in powder form.Since progesterone's use as \na drug antedates the 1938 law requiring special federal approval, its \nlegal status is similar to that of thyroid hormone. Unfortunately, for \nboth thyroid and progesterone, there is a tendency to cut corners for \nthe sake of a bigger profit margin.For example, steroid acetates \nare generally a little cheaper than the simple natural steroid. Some \npeople assume that an acetate or butyrate can be substituted for the \nsteroid itself. This can cause dangerous reactions.Medroxyprogesterone acetate \nis considered a progestin (though it is not supportive of gestation), \nbecause it modifies the uterus in approximately the wasy progesterone \ndoes, but it is luteolytic, and lowers the ovaries' production of progesterone \nwhile progesterone itself has a positive effect on the corpus luteum, \nstimulating progesterone synthesis. Defining progestin in a narrow \nway allows many synthetics to be sold as progestogens, though some of \nthem are strongly estrogenic, allowing them to function as contraceptives--it \nis odd that contraceptives and agents which suppress progesterone synthesis \nshould be officially called supported of pregnancy. It is probably \npartly the acetate group in the medroxyprogesterone acetate molecule \nwhich makes it bind firmly to receptors, yet causes it to block the \nenzymes which would normally be involved in progesterone metabolism. \n(I think testosterone, even, might be a safer progestin than medroxyprogesterone \nacetate.) Pregnenolone acetate similarly blocks the enzymes which normally \nmetabolize pregnenolone. (12) In aspirin, it has been found that it \nis the acetyl group which (by a free radical action) blocks an enzyme \ninvolved in prostaglandin synthesis.If the category called progestogens \nor progestins is to be defined  on the basis of a single \ntissue reaction, then it is possible to classify progesterone with the \ntoxic synthetic substances, but then it becomes highly deceptive to \nimply that progesterone isjusta progestin, or that it \nhas any of theother propertiesof the toxic synthetics, but this continues to be done. The warnings \nabout progestins causing birth defects, for example, cause epileptic \nwomen t use conventional anti-seizure drugs (all of which cause birth \ndefects) during pregnancy, and to avoid natural progesterone, which \ngenerally could control their seizures. Thus, a false message attached \nto progesterone creates precisely the harm it claims to want to prevent. \nIn my communications with the regulatory agencies, I have concluded \nthat their attempts to deceive are too blatant to ascribe to incompetence. \nWhether it's the Forest Service the FDA, the principle is the same: \nThe regulatory agencies have been captured by the regulated industries.Another place to cut costs \nis in the tocopherol. Tocopherol acetate does have vitamin E activity, \nbut sine it is only about half as efficiently absorbed as the simple \ntocopherol (13), it is a mistake to save a few dollars an ounce, at \nthe expense of losing half of the therapeutic effect. People who have \ncompared natural progesterone in natural tocopherols with other compositions \nhave insisted that the other compositions must not contain progesterone.The taste of natural vitamin \nE is stronger than that of the synthetic forms, but since the mixture \nis absorbed by any tissue it contacts, including various parts of the \nbowel, it can be taken in a capsule. If a small amount of olive oil \nis used with it, absorption through the skin is very rapid. Many women \nuse it vaginally, spread onto a diaphragm, to hold it in contact with \nthe membranes. The efficiency of absorption by all routes is so high \nthat patients should be warned against its anesthetic effect, until \ntheir dosage requirement is known approximately. Some physicians prefer \nconcentrations higher than 10%, but the risk of accidental drunkenness \nor anesthesia is higher with the stronger solutions.It is an indication of the \ntocopherol solution's high availability that medical researchers such \nas Roy Hertz (8), who thought they were administering maximal doses \nby combining injections with suppositories, never mentioned the problem \nof an anesthetic effect from an overdose. Similarly, it si evidence \nof the extremely poor availability of the micropulverized progesterone \nthat the researchers have administered hundreds of milligrams per day, \nwithout mentioning the symptoms of an overdose. Because of the difficulties \ninvolved in scientifically studying the clinical effectiveness of various \nformulations, I think the most practical way of evaluating the effectiveness \nof different progesterone formulations is to measure the amount extractable \nfrom the red blood cells, a few hours after the peak serum level has \nbeen reached. This will reasonably reflect the amounts reaching brain \ncells, adrenal glands, and the various other cells on which progesterone \nhas its therapeutic action.REFERENCES1. A A.

Some physicians prefer \nconcentrations higher than 10%, but the risk of accidental drunkenness \nor anesthesia is higher with the stronger solutions. It is an indication of the \ntocopherol solution's high availability that medical researchers such \nas Roy Hertz (8), who thought they were administering maximal doses \nby combining injections with suppositories, never mentioned the problem \nof an anesthetic effect from an overdose. Similarly, it si evidence \nof the extremely poor availability of the micropulverized progesterone \nthat the researchers have administered hundreds of milligrams per day, \nwithout mentioning the symptoms of an overdose. Because of the difficulties \ninvolved in scientifically studying the clinical effectiveness of various \nformulations, I think the most practical way of evaluating the effectiveness \nof different progesterone formulations is to measure the amount extractable \nfrom the red blood cells, a few hours after the peak serum level has \nbeen reached. This will reasonably reflect the amounts reaching brain \ncells, adrenal glands, and the various other cells on which progesterone \nhas its therapeutic action. REFERENCES © Ray Peat Ph.D. 2007.

Something was clearly wrong with the way the problem was \nbeing approached.If \nyou grind up a computer and dissolve it in acid, you can find out exactly \nwhat substances it was made of, but you won't learn from that information \nhow the computer worked. Twentieth century biologists became fond of \nemulsifying cells and studying the soluble parts. By the end of the \ncentury, they had identified so many parts that the government was financing \nprojects to use supercomputers to try to understand how the parts interacted.If \nsome essential information was lost in studying the parts, supercomputation \nisn't the way to find it. Even with infinite computing capacity, a description \nof the electrons on carbon and hydrogen atoms on amino acids in protein \nmolecules won't lead to the reality of how those atoms would have functioned \nin the living state.The \nimage of a cell as a watery solution contained in an elastic membrane \nbag is still having a radically stupefying effect on biology and medicine. \nThe idea that a cell can be understood by using a computer to model \na network of interactions between genes and gene products is nothing \nmore than a technologizing of the primitive understanding of life that \nwas promulgated by the Weismann-Mendel-Morganist school. It was the \ndogmatic insistence of that genetic determinist school that cancer originated \nwith a genetic mutation.By \nthe middle of the 20th century, that dogma had excluded the most important \nparts of biology from the schools and the journals. Ideas of a developmental \nfield, cellular coherence, and holistic cooperativity were denounced \nas unscientific vitalism. Returning to the idea of a \"cancer field\" \nis an essential first step in thinking realistically about preventing \nand treating cancer, but that idea has hardly progressed since the 1930s.In \nthe last few years, interest in cloning and stem cells and tissue regeneration \nhas revived interest in studying the factors that contribute to the \nspatial and temporal ordering of cell growth.The \nidea of a developmental field was a fundamental part of embryology in \nthe first half of the 20th century. It was an empirical idea, supported \nmost commonly by evidence that diffusing substances and secreted materials \ngoverned the differentiation of cells and tissues, but the form-generating \neffects of bioelectric fields were also often demonstrated, and there \nwas some evidence that tissue radiations played a role. The extracellular \nmatrix secreted by cells served to transmit information between cells, \nbut its form was regulated by cells, and its structure was a factor \ngoverning the cells' differentiation.Experiments \nin amphibians showed that regeneration of organs had a reciprocal relationship \nwith the development of cancer--a tumor could be turned into a tail, \nfor example, if it was grafted onto the stump following amputation of \nthe tail, but factors that weakened regeneration could cause a tumor \nto develop. In these experiments, the normal organism's morphogenetic \nor epimorphic field overrode the disordered developmental field of the \ntumor.In \nthe absence of overriding external influences, the disordered system \nof the tumor, in which cells emitted many products of their disordered \nmetabolism, could interfere with the normal functions of the organism. \nAll of the products of the injured cells, including their altered extracellular \nmatrix, constituted the cancer field.The \nrecent recognition of the \"bystander effect\" of radiation \nexposure, in which cells that haven't been irradiated undergo genetic \nchanges or death when they are exposed to irradiated cells, has provided \nan opportunity to return to the \"field\" idea in cancer, because \nthe stress-induced factors emitted by irradiated cells are the same \ntoxic factors emitted by cells undergoing carcinogenesis from other \ncauses, such as over-exposure to estrogen.H. \nJ. Muller, one of T. H. Morgan's students and colleagues, studied the \nmutagenic effects of x-rays, and the genetic determinists argued that \nthe random changes produced in the genetic material by ionizing radiation \nprovided a model of the evolutionary process. Randomly altered genes \nand natural selection would explain everything, including cancer. Every \ntime cells divide, their genes supposedly become more susceptible to \nrandom changes, so increased replication of cells would increase the \nrisk of producing genetic changes leading to cancer. This idea is so \nsimple and so widely believed that many people focus only on the rate \nof proliferation, and the random mutations that supposedly occur during \nproliferation, when they try to explain carcinogenesis. They feel that \nit's reasonable to discuss cancer without bothering to understand the \nphysiology of the cell or the organism.The \norganism can only be understood in its environments, and a cell can't \nbe understood without reference to the tissue and organism in which \nit lives. Although the geneticists were at first hostile to the idea \nthat nutrition and geography could have anything to do with cancer, \nthey soon tried to dominate those fields, insisting that mutagens and \nethnicity would explain everything. But the evidence now makes it very \nclear that environment and nutrition affect the risk of cancer in ways \nthat are not primarily genetic.Every \ntumor, like every person, has a uniqueness, but valid and practical \nempirical generalizations can be made, if we understand some of their \nproperties and the conditions that govern their development and survival.Percival \nPotts' observation of scrotal cancer in chimney sweeps eventually led \nto the study of soot carcinogenesis, and then to the study of the properties \nof the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soot. The similarities of \nthose properties to estrogen's soon became apparent.Over \nthe decades, many studies have confirmed that prolonged, continuous \nexposure to estrogen is carcinogenic, and that progesterone offsets \nthose effects.Following \nthe animal studies that showed that carcinogenesis by estrogen could \nbe prevented or reversed by progesterone, studies of the endogenous \nhormones in women showed that those with a natural excess of estrogen, \nand/or deficiency of progesterone, were the most likely to develop uterine \nor breast cancers.The \nMorganist school of genetic determinism moved into endocrinology with \na doctrine that hormones act only through hormone receptors, proteins \nwhich activate certain genes.Many \nresearchers -- physical chemists, biochemists, cytologists, embryologists, \nreproductive and developmental biologists, gerontologists, physiologists, \nneurologists, endocrinologists -- were investigating estrogen's properties \nand actions, and had made great progress by the 1950s, despite the medical \nfrauds being perpetrated by the estrogen industry (Rothenberg, 2005).All \nof this complex and subtle work was of no interest to a small group \nof people who wanted to impose their genetic views onto biology.The \ninventor of the estrogen receptor, Elwood Jensen, has written that the \nresults of certain of his experiments \"caused the demise of the \ntranshydrogenation hypothesis and convinced all but the most diehard \nenzymologists that estradiol binds to a characteristic component of \ntarget cells to exert its physiological effect without itself being \nchemically altered.\" The hypothesis he referred to was just part \nof a large fairly systematic international effort.How \nhe did away with the opposition, who were studying the complex metabolic \nactions of estrogen, was by synthesizing isotope-labeled estradiol and \nestrone, and claiming to observe that they weren't metabolically altered, \nas they produced their hormonal effect. Since the experiment was extremely \nexpensive, and required the cooperation of the Atomic Energy Commission, \nit wasn't easily repeated. However, many experiments have subsequently \ndemonstrated that practically every tissue in the body (and plants and \nbacteria) metabolize the estrogens, causing estradiol to change into \nestrone, and estrone, into estradiol. Jensen's decisive and historically \ncrucial experiment was false.But \nit served its purpose, and (with help from the pharmaceutical industry \nand government granting agencies) marginalized the work of those \"enzymologists\" \nand everyone else who persisted in studying the complex actions of estrogen.The \nenzyme that converts the weaker estrone into the stronger estradiol \nis an important factor in determining estrogen's effects on a particular \ntissue. Progesterone is able to regulate the cell's metabolism, so that \nthe oxidative pathway, forming estrone from estradiol, predominates. \nEstrogen-dominated tissues are likely to have a balance in the direction \nof reduction rather than oxidation, increasing the amount of the active \nestradiol.The \nimmediate effects of estrogen and progesterone on cells, that occur \nlong before genes can be activated, were simply ignored or denied by \nthe promoters of the estrogen receptor doctrine. Some of these excitatory \nor antiexcitatory effects are probably structural changes, that involve \nthe mobilization of calcium inside cells, and the activation or inhibition \nof reactions involving phosphoric acid. Although they have been known \nfor many years, they are always referred to as \"novel\" or \n\"non-classical\" effects, and are called \"membrane effects,\" \nbecause that's the only way the reductionists are able to identify changes \nthat happen immediately throughout the cell.Cellular excitation involves an increase of intracellular calcium and \nthe activation of phosphorylating enzymes in cells. Some experiments \nsuggest (Improta-Brears, et al., 1999) that the estrogen receptor mediates \nestrogen's ability to mobilize calcium (leading to the activation of \ncell division, mitosis). Whether or not it does, the recognition that \nestrogen activates calcium, leading to activation of the phosphorylation \nsystem, should \"cause the demise of\" the \"classical estrogen \nreceptor\" doctrine, because the phosphorylation system alters the \nexpression of genes, much as the estrogen receptor was supposed to do \nby its direct actions.But before it alters the expression of genes, \nit alters the activities of enzymes.When estrogen activates calcium \nand phosphorylation independently of the estrogen receptor, the situation \nis even worse for the Jensen dogma.Progesterone's \nopposition to those early excitatory effects of estrogen are so basic, \nthat there shouldn't be any difficulty in thinking of it as an antiestrogen, \nthat stops cell division primarily by opposing the excitatory effects \nof estrogen and other mitogens. Progesterone's opposition to the calcium-activating \nand phosphorylating effects of estrogen affects everything in the cell, \naccording to the cell's specific nature.But \nthe reductionists don't like \"nongenomic\" explanations of \nanything, even when they are triggered by the estrogen receptor rather \nthan by a membrane-event. So, to argue that progesterone's opposition \nto estrogen is general, it's necessary to examine each of estrogen's \nactions, where those actions are clearly known, and to evaluate progesterone's \neffects on the same events.When \na cell is stimulated or slightly stressed, homeostatic mechanisms are \nactivated that help it to return to its normal resting state. The mobilization \nof calcium and the phosphorylation system is followed by increased synthesis \nof cholesterol and the formation of glucose from glycogen. Cholesterol \nitself is protective, and in some cells it is massively converted into \nprogesterone, which is even more effective in restoring homeostasis.In \nthe ovary, the enzymes that synthesize cholesterol, along with the production \nof progesterone, are activated by the pituitary hormone, FSH, but also \nby estrogen. In the liver and uterus and vascular endothelium, which \naren't specialized for the production of progesterone, stimulation by \nestrogen activates the enzymes to increase the formation of cholesterol.When \ncells are injured or seriously stressed, instead of being able to directly \nrecover their normal quiescence, they may instead mobilize their systems \nfor growing and replicating, to replace damaged or destroyed cells.Prolonged \nexposure to estrogen, that can't be offset by the homeostatic factors, \nsuch as progesterone, typically causes cells to enter a growth phase. \n(But so do other excitatory processes, such as ionizing radiation.)One \nof the basic reactions to injury is to shift the cell away from oxidative \nmetabolism to glycolytic metabolism, which is inefficient, but can support \ncell division. Chemical stains show that during cell division cells \nare in a reduced state, with abundant sulfhydryl groups including reduced \nglutathione and protein sulfhydryls. This shift in itself increases \nthe formation of active estradiol from estrone.In \nthe inflamed or estrogen dominated cell, enzymes such as the cyclooxidases \n(COX), that convert arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, are activated. \nBeta-glucuronidase and sulfatases are activated, and these cause intracellular \nestrogen to increase, by removing the water soluble sulfate and glucuronate \nportions from estrogens that had been inactivated. The detoxifying enzymes \nthat attach those molecules to estrogen are inactivated in the estrogen \ndominated cell. The prostaglandin formed from arachidonic acid stimulates \nthe formation of the enzyme aromatase or estrogen synthetase, that converts \nandrogens into estrogen.Those \nprocesses, initiated by excitation or injury, increase the amount of \nestrogen in the cell, which intensifies the excitation.Progesterone \nopposes all of those processes, decreasing the amount of estrogen in \nthe cell by modifying the activities of those five types of enzyme.Although \nmany kinds of protein (including enzymes) bind estrogen, the protein \nthat Jensen called \"the estrogen receptor\" is largely responsible \nfor the ability of the uterus and breasts to retain high concentrations \nof estrogen. Various kinds of stimulation or stress (including heat \nand oxygen deprivation) cause its appearance, and estrogen itself increases \nthe amount of the estrogen receptor in a cell. The estrogen receptor \ndoesn't just \"activate genes,\" as the Jensen dogma claimed. \nFor example, the estrogen receptor directly binds and inactivates the \n\n\"tumor suppressor\" p53 protein, which otherwise would restrain \nthe replication of damaged cells.Progesterone \ncauses the estrogen receptor to be eliminated. (Batra; Boling and Blandau; \nResko, et al.)Among \nthe cell activating factors, other than estrogen, are proteins that \nare considered to be \"oncogenes,\" because of their involvement \nin cancer. Several of these proteins are activated by estrogen, inhibited \nby progesterone. The term \"oncogene\" refers to any gene that \ncontributes to the development of cancer, but it is so burdened by ideology \nthat it shouldn't be used as if it had a simple clear meaning.A \nvariety of proteins promote cell activity and replication, under the \ninfluence of estrogen. The \"composite transcription factor activating \nprotein 1,\" AP-1 which integrates the effects of other transcription \nfactors, is important in a variety of cell types, and its activity is \nincreased by estrogen and decreased by progesterone.When \nthe \"progesterone receptor\"lacks progesterone,it \nhas the opposite effect of progesterone, and this feature has been used \npropagandistically, by infecting cells with a virus carrying the progesterone \nreceptor protein, and then suggesting that the disturbed functions of \nthe cell reflect a potential effect of progesterone. The receptor, lacking \nprogesterone, tells the cell that it has a progesterone deficiency, \nbut too many molecular endocrinologists are trying to say that the receptor \nprotein is the same as the progesterone.The \ngenerality of the process of excitation/activation can be clearly seen \nin the effects of the nerve-inhibiting GABA and the nerve-exciting glutamate \nor NMDA. In cultured breast cancer cells, GABA inhibits growth, NMDA \nincreases growth. As in the brain, progesterone supports the actions \nof GABA, and opposes those of NMDA or the excitatory amino acids, while \nestrogen in general promotes the effects of the excitatory amino acids, \nand opposes those of GABA.Both the excitatory amino acids and a peptide that promotes inflammation, \ntumor necrosis factor (TNF), activate the enzyme which makes estrogen, \naromatase. Estrogen, by activating NF kappaB, increases the formation \nof TNF, which in itself can promote the growth and metastasis of cancer. \nVarious antiinflammatory agents, including aspirin, progesterone, testosterone, \nsaturated fats, and glycine, can inhibit the production of NF kappaB.An \nenzyme that has been thought of mainly in relation to the brain is catechol-O-methyl \ntransferase, which is inhibited by estrogen (producing effects similar \nto cocaine), leading to brain excitation.The enzyme detoxifies catecholestrogen \n(Creveling, 2003), protecting cells from DNA damage (Lavigne, et al., \n2001). When the activity of this enzyme is low, there is increased risk \nof breast cancer (Matsui, et al., 2000). Progesterone increases its \nactivity (Inoue and Creveling, 1991, 1995).Another \nenzyme system that affects the body's reactions to stress and modifies \nprocesses of inflammation and growth, the monoamino-oxidases, is affected \noppositely by estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen's effects are partly \nmediated by increased formation of serotonin, progesterone's, by decreasing \nit. Histamine is another promoter of inflammation that is increased \nby estrogen, decreased by progesterone.Estrogen's \neffects in the nervous system go beyond the production of cocaine-like \nhypomania, or chorea, or epilepsy, and include the activation of the \nbasic stress hormones, increasing the formation in the hypothalamus \nof pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which is a precursor of ACTH to activate \nthe adrenals, and endorphins (\"endogenous opiates\"), which \nstimulate growth processes. Both endorphins and ACTH can be found in \ntumors such as breast cancer. The ACTH stimulates the production of \ncortisol, that protects against some of the immediate causes of inflammation \nand growth, but that contributes to the loss of resistance, and increases \nestrogen synthesis.A \nprotein called the sigma receptor, known for its role in cocaine's action, \nbinds progesterone, and can inhibit the growth of cancer. Some anesthetics \nhave similar effects on tumors, acting through this protein. The sigma \nreceptor, in association with progesterone or pregnenolone, is protective \nagainst the excitatory amino acids.The \nextracellular medium changes during the development of a tumor. Irritated \nhypoxic cells, and estrogen-stimulated cells, increase their production \nof collagen, and the increase of collagen interferes with normal cell \nfunctions. Progesterone reduces the formation of collagen, and probably \ncontributes to its removal.Naloxone \nor naltrexone, which blocks the actions of the endorphins and morphine, \nis being used to inhibit the growth of various kinds of cancer, including \nbreast cancer and prostate cancer. Leptin (which is promoted by estrogen) \nis a hormone produced by fat cells, and it, like estrogen, activates \nthe POMC-related endorphin stress system. The endorphins activate histamine, \nanother promoter of inflammation and cell division.Progesterone \nopposes those various biochemical effects of estrogen in multiple ways, \nfor example by inhibiting the ACTH stress response, by restraining cortisol's \nharmful actions, and by inhibiting leptin.Mediators \nof the radiation bystander effect include NO, TNF, COX, and prostaglandins. \nThese are produced by other things that cause inflammation and injury, \nincluding estrogen.Cell \ndivision, when it is part of the body's continuous renewal and adaptation,  \nisn't a source of mutations or degeneration, but when it is induced \nby the mediators of inflammation produced in response to injury, it \nleads to inherited changes, loss of differentiated function, and eventually \nto genetic instability.When \ncell division is so disturbed that the number of chromosomes becomes \nabnormal, the instability of these cells decreases their ability to \nsurvive, but when the causes of the inflammation persist, they will \ncontinue to be replaced by other abnormal cells. The toxic products \nof dying cells can reach a point at which the debris can't be removed, \nadding to the injury and inflammation. The damaged bystander cells spread \ntheir influence through a cancer field, injuring more cells.One \nof the \"field\" effects of cancer is the stimulation of new \nblood vessel development, angiogenesis. Lactic acid stimulates the formation \nof new blood vessels, the secretion of collagen, and tumor growth. Low \noxygen, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, prostaglandins and other products \nof tissue stress can stimulate the growth of new blood vessels, at the \nsame time that they stimulate tumor growth and impair oxidative metabolism. \nSeveral of these agents promote each other's activity.Therapeutic \nthinking has been influenced by the doctrine of the mutant cell as the \ninitiator of cancer, leading to the idea that only things which kill \nthe cancer cells can cure cancer. But when the body stops activating \nthe processes of inflammation and growth, normal processes of tissue \nrepair have an opportunity to eliminate the tumor. Even the fibroblasts \nwhich normally secrete collagen can participate in its removal (Simoes, \net al., 1984). Something as simple as eliminating lactate can change \ntheir functions.Although \nthe angiogenic action of lactate has been known for several decades, \nsome researchers believed that a specific anti-angiogenic peptide could \nbe found which would stop the growth of cancer cells. The interest in \nangiogenesis tacitly acknowledges that there is a cancer field, but \nthe faith that cancer could be cured only by killing the mutant cells \nseems to have guided the search for a single antiangiogenic substance. \nSuch a substance would be toxic to normal tissues, since blood vessels \nare constantly being renewed.The \nmore advanced a tumor is, the more numerous the growth-promoting factors \nare likely to be, and the weaker the body's ability becomes to control \nthem.The \nsearch for toxic factors to kill the cancer cells is unlikely to lead \nto a generally effective treatment. Even immunological approaches that \nthink in terms of destroying a tumor might be misconceiving the nature \nof the problem. For example, the protein called \"tumor necrosis \nfactor\" (TNF) or cachectin was discovered as a result of Lawrence \nBurton's work in the 1960s. He extracted proteins from the blood that \ncould shrink some tumors in mice with amazing speed. In the right setting, \nTNF is involved in the destruction of tumors, but when other factors \nare missing, it can make them worse. Burton was focussing on factors \nin the immune system that could destroy cancer, but he ignored the basic \nproblem of tissue degeneration that produces tumors which are complex \nand changing.If \nthe cancer-productive field is taken into account, all of the factors \nthat promote and sustain that field should be considered during therapy.Two \nubiquitous carcinogenic factors that can be manipulated without toxins \nare the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and estrogen. These closely \ninteract with each other, and there are many ways in which they can \nbe modulated.For \nexample, keeping cells in a well oxygenated state with thyroid hormone \nand carbon dioxide will shift the balance from estradiol toward the \nweaker estrone. The thyroid stimulation will cause the liver to excrete \nestrogen more quickly, and will help to prevent the formation of aromatase \nin the tissues. Low temperature is one of the factors that increases \nthe formation of estrogen. Lactic acid, serotonin, nitric oxide, prostaglandins, \nand the endorphins will be decreased by the shift toward efficient oxidative \nmetabolism.Progesterone \nsynthesis will be increased by the higher metabolic rate, and will tend \nto keep the temperature higher.Thyroid \nhormone, by causing a shift away from estrogen and serotonin, lowers \nprolactin, which is involved in the promotion of several kinds of cancer.Vitamin \nD and vitamin K have some antiestrogenic effects. Vitamin D and calcium \nlower the inflammation-promoting parathyroid hormone (PTH).Eliminating \npolyunsaturated fats from the diet is essential if the bystander effect \nis eventually to be restrained. Aspirin and salicylic acid can block \nmany of the carcinogenic effects of the PUFA. Saturated fats have a \nvariety of antiinflammatory and anticancer actions. Some of those effects \nare direct, others are the result of blocking the toxic effects of the \nPUFA. Keeping the stored unsaturated fats from circulating in the blood \nis helpful, since it takes years to eliminate them from the tissues \nafter the diet has changed. Niacinamide inhibits lipolysis. Avoiding \nover-production of lipolytic adrenaline requires adequate thyroid hormone, \nand the adjustment of the diet to minimize fluctuations of blood sugar.The \nendorphins are antagonistic to progesterone, and when they are minimized, \nprogesterone tends to increase, and to be more effective. The drugs \nnaloxone and naltrexone, which block the effects of the endorphins, \nhave several remarkable effects that resemble progesterone's. Naltrexone \nhas been successfully used to treat prostate and breast cancer.Opiates \nare still commonly used for pain relief in cancer patients, despite \nthe evidence that has accumulated for several decades indicating that \nthey promote inflammation and cancer growth, while suppressing immunity \nand causing tissue catabolism, exacerbating the wasting that commonly \noccurs with cancer. Their use, rather than alternatives such as procaine, \naspirin, and progesterone, is nothing but a medical fetish.Stress \nand estrogen tend to produce alkalosis, while thyroid, carbon dioxide, \nand adequate protein in the diet help to prevent alkalosis.Antihistamines \nand some of the antiserotonin drugs (including \"dopaminergic\" \nlisuride and bromocriptine) are sometimes useful in cancer treatment, \nbut the safe way to lower serotonin is to reduce the consumption of \ntryptophan, and to avoid excessive cortisol production (which mobilizes \ntryptophan from the muscles). Pregnenolone and sucrose tend to prevent \nover-production of cortisol.In \nthe breast, COX-2 converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which \nactivate the enzyme aromatase, that forms estrogen from androgens. Until \nthe tissues are free of PUFA, aspirin and salicylic acid can be used \nto stop prostaglandin synthesis.Thyroid \nis needed to keep the cell in an oxidative, rather than reductive state, \nand progesterone (which is produced elsewhere only when cells are in \na rapidly oxidizing state) activates the processes that remove estrogen \nfrom the cell, and inactivates the processes that would form new estrogen \nin the cell.Thyroid, \nand the carbon dioxide it produces, prevent the formation of the toxic \nlactic acid. When there is enough carbon dioxide in the tissues, the \ncell is kept in an oxidative state, and the formation of toxic free \nradicals is suppressed. Carbon dioxide therapy is extremely safe.In \nthe 1930s, primates as well as rodents had been used in experiments \nto show the carcinogenic effects of estrogen, and the protective effects \nof progesterone.By \n1950, the results of animal studies of progesterone's anticancer effects \nwere so clear that the National Cancer Institute got involved. But the \nestrogen industry had already been conducting its campaign against progesterone, \nand had convinced most doctors that it was inactive when taken orally, \nand so was inferior to their proprietary drugs that they called \"progestins.\" \nThe result was that it was usually given by injection, dissolved in \nvegetable oil or synthetic solvents such as benzyl benzoate or benzyl \nalcohol, which are very toxic and inflammation-producing.The \nNCI researchers (Hertz, et al., 1951) treated 17 women with visible \ncancers of the uterine cervix that had been confirmed by biopsies. They \nwere given daily intramuscular injections of 250 mg of progesterone \nin vegetable oil. Although they described the treatment as \"massive \ndosage with progesterone,\" it didn't prevent menstruation in any \nof the women who had been menstruating before the treatment began. During \na healthy pregnancy, a woman produces more progesterone than that.Their \narticle includes some photographs of cervical tumors before treatment, \nand after 31 days, 50 days, and 65 days of progesterone treatment. The \nimprovement is clear. The examining physicians described softening of \nthe tumor, and stopping of bleeding and pain.\"In \neleven of the 17 treated patients visible and palpable evidence of regressive \nalteration of the tumor mass could be demonstrated. This consisted of \n(a) distinct reduction in size of the visible portion of the cancer \nas well as reduction of the palpable extent of the mass, (b) reduction \nin vascularity and friability of the visible lesion with a clearly demonstrable \nepithelization of previously raw surfaces and (c) markedly increased \npliability of the previously rigid and infiltrated parametria.\"\"In \n10 cases there was associated with this type of gross change a reduction \nin, or complete cessation of vaginal bleeding and discharge.\"\"Only \none of the 17 patients showed active progression of the carcinomatous \nprocess while under the progesterone administration. The six patients \nwhose lesions failed to show clearly demonstrable regressive changes \nshowed minor alterations in size and vascularity of insufficient degree \nto be convincing to all clinical observers concerned. Nevertheless, \nnone of the lesions under study appeared to be accelerated by progesterone.\"Observing \nvery similar patients under similar conditions while they were waiting \nfor surgery, but were not receiving progesterone, they saw no such regressions \nof tumors.The \nphotographs and descriptions of the changes in the tumors were remarkable \nfor any cancer study, but to have been produced by a treatment that \ndidn't even alter the patients' menstrual cycle, the reader might expect \nthe authors to discuss their plans for further studies of such a successful \nmethod.But \ninstead, they concluded \"We do not consider the regressive changes \nobserved to be sufficient to indicate the use of progesterone as a therapeutic \nagent in carcinoma of the cervix.\"(Their \nresearch was supported by a grant from the American Cancer Society.)If \nthe researchers had bothered to test progesterone on themselves or on \nanimals, they would have discovered that it is fully active when taken \norally, dissolved in oil, and that nontoxic saturated fats could have \nbeen used. Progesterone anesthesia was very well known at that time, \nso it would have been reasonable to use doses that were at least equivalent \nto the concentrations present during pregnancy, even if they didn't \nwant to use doses that would approach the anesthetic level. The total \ndaily doses could have been about ten times higher, if they had been \ngiven orally as divided doses.The \nsolvent issue continues to impede research in the use of progesterone \nfor treating cancer, but the main problem is the continuing belief that \n\"the cancer cell\" is the problem, rather than the cancer field. \nSubstances are tested for their ability to kill cancer cellsin vitro, \nbecause of the basic belief that mutated genes are the cause of the \ndisease. When progesterone is tested on cancer cellsin vitro,the experimenter often sees nothing but the effects of the solvent, \nand doesn't realize that nearly all of the progesterone has precipitated \nin the medium, before reaching the cancer cells.The \ncancer industry began a few years ago to combine chemicals for chemotherapy, \nfor example adding caffeine to paclitaxel or platinum (cisplatin), or \nhistamine to doxorubicin, but they do it simply to increase the toxicity \nof the chemical to the tumor, or to decrease its toxicity to the patient. \nDoctors sometimes refer to combined chemotherapy as a \"shotgun \napproach,\" meaning that it lacks the acumen of their ideal silver \nbullet approach. If cancers were werewolves, the cancer industry's search \nfor more refined killing technologies might be going in the right direction. \nBut the genetic doctrine of cancer's origin is just as mythical as werewolves \nand vampires.A \nsafe physiological approach to cancer, based on the opposition of progesterone \nto estrogen, would be applicable to every type of cancer promoted by \nestrogen, or by factors which produce the same effects as estrogen, \nand that would include all of the known types of cancer. Estrogen acts \neven on cells that have no \"estrogen receptors,\" but estrogen \nreceptors can be found in every organ.As \nestrogen's non-feminizing actions are increasingly being recognized \nto include contributions to other kinds of disease, including Alzheimer's \ndisease, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, the idea of the bystander \neffect, and the field of cellular degeneration, will eventually clear \nthe way for a rational use of the therapeutic tools that already exist.There \nare several types of drug---carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, to increase \ncarbon dioxide in the tissues, lysergic acid derivatives, to block serotonin \nand suppress prolactin, anti-opiates, antiexcitotoxic and GABAergic \nagents, anesthetics, antihistamines, anticholinergics, salicylic acid \nderivatives---that could probably be useful in a comprehensive therapy \nfor cancer, but their combinations won't be explored as long as treatments \nare designed only to kill.Preventing \nor correcting disturbances in the morphogenetic field should be the \nfocus of attention.REFERENCESBiochem \nBiophys Res Commun. 1991 Mar 15;175(2):625-30.Antitumor activity \nof naltrexone and correlation with steroid hormone receptors.Abou-Issa \nH, Tejwani GA.Contraception 1981 Apr;23(4):447-55.Comparison of plasma and myometrial tissue concentrations of estradiol-17 \nbeta and progesterone in nonpregnant women.Akerlund M, Batra S, \nHelm G.Obstetrics \nand gynecology New York 2001 vol.97 no.4 (Supplement) page S10.

Thus, increased \nsteroid sulfatase expression may be partly responsible for local overproduction \nof estrogen and provide a growth advantage for tumor cells.Fed \nProc. 1980 Jun;39(8):2533-8.Influence of endogenous opiates on anterior \npituitary function.Van Vugt DA, Meites J.Clin Endocrinol (Oxf) 1978 \nJul;9(1):59-66.Sex hormone concentrations in post-menopausal women.Vermeulen A, Verdonck L. Plasma sex hormone concentrations (testosterone, \n(T), androstenedione (A), oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2) were measured \nin forty post-menopausal women more than 4 years post-normal menopause.Sex hormone concentrations in \nthis group of postmenopausal women (greater than 4YPM) did not show \nany variation as a function of age,with the possible exception \nof E2 which showed a tendency to decrease in the late post-menopause.\"J Steroid Biochem 1984 Nov;21(5):607-12.The endogenous concentration of estradiol and estrone in normal human \npostmenopausal endometrium.Vermeulen-Meiners C, Jaszmann LJ, Haspels \nAA, Poortman J, Thijssen JH The endogenous estrone (E1) and estradiol \n(E2) levels (pg/g tissue) were measured in 54 postmenopausal, atrophic \nendometria and compared with the E1 and E2 levels in plasma (pg/ml). \nThe results from the tissue levels of both steroidsshowed large \nvariations and there was no significant correlation with their plasma \nlevels.

All \nthrough the last century, as more and more resources were devoted to \nsolving \"the cancer problem,\" the death rate from cancer increased \nevery year. Something was clearly wrong with the way the problem was \nbeing approached. If \nyou grind up a computer and dissolve it in acid, you can find out exactly \nwhat substances it was made of, but you won't learn from that information \nhow the computer worked. Twentieth century biologists became fond of \nemulsifying cells and studying the soluble parts. By the end of the \ncentury, they had identified so many parts that the government was financing \nprojects to use supercomputers to try to understand how the parts interacted. If \nsome essential information was lost in studying the parts, supercomputation \nisn't the way to find it. Even with infinite computing capacity, a description \nof the electrons on carbon and hydrogen atoms on amino acids in protein \nmolecules won't lead to the reality of how those atoms would have functioned \nin the living state. The \nimage of a cell as a watery solution contained in an elastic membrane \nbag is still having a radically stupefying effect on biology and medicine. \nThe idea that a cell can be understood by using a computer to model \na network of interactions between genes and gene products is nothing \nmore than a technologizing of the primitive understanding of life that \nwas promulgated by the Weismann-Mendel-Morganist school. It was the \ndogmatic insistence of that genetic determinist school that cancer originated \nwith a genetic mutation. By \nthe middle of the 20th century, that dogma had excluded the most important \nparts of biology from the schools and the journals. Ideas of a developmental \nfield, cellular coherence, and holistic cooperativity were denounced \nas unscientific vitalism. Returning to the idea of a \"cancer field\" \nis an essential first step in thinking realistically about preventing \nand treating cancer, but that idea has hardly progressed since the 1930s. In \nthe last few years, interest in cloning and stem cells and tissue regeneration \nhas revived interest in studying the factors that contribute to the \nspatial and temporal ordering of cell growth. The \nidea of a developmental field was a fundamental part of embryology in \nthe first half of the 20th century. It was an empirical idea, supported \nmost commonly by evidence that diffusing substances and secreted materials \ngoverned the differentiation of cells and tissues, but the form-generating \neffects of bioelectric fields were also often demonstrated, and there \nwas some evidence that tissue radiations played a role. The extracellular \nmatrix secreted by cells served to transmit information between cells, \nbut its form was regulated by cells, and its structure was a factor \ngoverning the cells' differentiation. Experiments \nin amphibians showed that regeneration of organs had a reciprocal relationship \nwith the development of cancer--a tumor could be turned into a tail, \nfor example, if it was grafted onto the stump following amputation of \nthe tail, but factors that weakened regeneration could cause a tumor \nto develop. In these experiments, the normal organism's morphogenetic \nor epimorphic field overrode the disordered developmental field of the \ntumor. In \nthe absence of overriding external influences, the disordered system \nof the tumor, in which cells emitted many products of their disordered \nmetabolism, could interfere with the normal functions of the organism. \nAll of the products of the injured cells, including their altered extracellular \nmatrix, constituted the cancer field. The \nrecent recognition of the \"bystander effect\" of radiation \nexposure, in which cells that haven't been irradiated undergo genetic \nchanges or death when they are exposed to irradiated cells, has provided \nan opportunity to return to the \"field\" idea in cancer, because \nthe stress-induced factors emitted by irradiated cells are the same \ntoxic factors emitted by cells undergoing carcinogenesis from other \ncauses, such as over-exposure to estrogen. H. \nJ. Muller, one of T. H. Morgan's students and colleagues, studied the \nmutagenic effects of x-rays, and the genetic determinists argued that \nthe random changes produced in the genetic material by ionizing radiation \nprovided a model of the evolutionary process. Randomly altered genes \nand natural selection would explain everything, including cancer. Every \ntime cells divide, their genes supposedly become more susceptible to \nrandom changes, so increased replication of cells would increase the \nrisk of producing genetic changes leading to cancer. This idea is so \nsimple and so widely believed that many people focus only on the rate \nof proliferation, and the random mutations that supposedly occur during \nproliferation, when they try to explain carcinogenesis. They feel that \nit's reasonable to discuss cancer without bothering to understand the \nphysiology of the cell or the organism. The \norganism can only be understood in its environments, and a cell can't \nbe understood without reference to the tissue and organism in which \nit lives. Although the geneticists were at first hostile to the idea \nthat nutrition and geography could have anything to do with cancer, \nthey soon tried to dominate those fields, insisting that mutagens and \nethnicity would explain everything. But the evidence now makes it very \nclear that environment and nutrition affect the risk of cancer in ways \nthat are not primarily genetic. Every \ntumor, like every person, has a uniqueness, but valid and practical \nempirical generalizations can be made, if we understand some of their \nproperties and the conditions that govern their development and survival. Percival \nPotts' observation of scrotal cancer in chimney sweeps eventually led \nto the study of soot carcinogenesis, and then to the study of the properties \nof the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soot. The similarities of \nthose properties to estrogen's soon became apparent. Over \nthe decades, many studies have confirmed that prolonged, continuous \nexposure to estrogen is carcinogenic, and that progesterone offsets \nthose effects. Following \nthe animal studies that showed that carcinogenesis by estrogen could \nbe prevented or reversed by progesterone, studies of the endogenous \nhormones in women showed that those with a natural excess of estrogen, \nand/or deficiency of progesterone, were the most likely to develop uterine \nor breast cancers. The \nMorganist school of genetic determinism moved into endocrinology with \na doctrine that hormones act only through hormone receptors, proteins \nwhich activate certain genes. Many \nresearchers -- physical chemists, biochemists, cytologists, embryologists, \nreproductive and developmental biologists, gerontologists, physiologists, \nneurologists, endocrinologists -- were investigating estrogen's properties \nand actions, and had made great progress by the 1950s, despite the medical \nfrauds being perpetrated by the estrogen industry (Rothenberg, 2005). All \nof this complex and subtle work was of no interest to a small group \nof people who wanted to impose their genetic views onto biology. The \ninventor of the estrogen receptor, Elwood Jensen, has written that the \nresults of certain of his experiments \"caused the demise of the \ntranshydrogenation hypothesis and convinced all but the most diehard \nenzymologists that estradiol binds to a characteristic component of \ntarget cells to exert its physiological effect without itself being \nchemically altered.\" The hypothesis he referred to was just part \nof a large fairly systematic international effort. How \nhe did away with the opposition, who were studying the complex metabolic \nactions of estrogen, was by synthesizing isotope-labeled estradiol and \nestrone, and claiming to observe that they weren't metabolically altered, \nas they produced their hormonal effect. Since the experiment was extremely \nexpensive, and required the cooperation of the Atomic Energy Commission, \nit wasn't easily repeated. However, many experiments have subsequently \ndemonstrated that practically every tissue in the body (and plants and \nbacteria) metabolize the estrogens, causing estradiol to change into \nestrone, and estrone, into estradiol. Jensen's decisive and historically \ncrucial experiment was false. But \nit served its purpose, and (with help from the pharmaceutical industry \nand government granting agencies) marginalized the work of those \"enzymologists\" \nand everyone else who persisted in studying the complex actions of estrogen. The \nenzyme that converts the weaker estrone into the stronger estradiol \nis an important factor in determining estrogen's effects on a particular \ntissue. Progesterone is able to regulate the cell's metabolism, so that \nthe oxidative pathway, forming estrone from estradiol, predominates. \nEstrogen-dominated tissues are likely to have a balance in the direction \nof reduction rather than oxidation, increasing the amount of the active \nestradiol. The \nimmediate effects of estrogen and progesterone on cells, that occur \nlong before genes can be activated, were simply ignored or denied by \nthe promoters of the estrogen receptor doctrine. Some of these excitatory \nor antiexcitatory effects are probably structural changes, that involve \nthe mobilization of calcium inside cells, and the activation or inhibition \nof reactions involving phosphoric acid. Although they have been known \nfor many years, they are always referred to as \"novel\" or \n\"non-classical\" effects, and are called \"membrane effects,\" \nbecause that's the only way the reductionists are able to identify changes \nthat happen immediately throughout the cell. Cellular excitation involves an increase of intracellular calcium and \nthe activation of phosphorylating enzymes in cells. Some experiments \nsuggest (Improta-Brears, et al., 1999) that the estrogen receptor mediates \nestrogen's ability to mobilize calcium (leading to the activation of \ncell division, mitosis). Whether or not it does, the recognition that \nestrogen activates calcium, leading to activation of the phosphorylation \nsystem, should \"cause the demise of\" the \"classical estrogen \nreceptor\" doctrine, because the phosphorylation system alters the \nexpression of genes, much as the estrogen receptor was supposed to do \nby its direct actions.But before it alters the expression of genes, \nit alters the activities of enzymes.When estrogen activates calcium \nand phosphorylation independently of the estrogen receptor, the situation \nis even worse for the Jensen dogma. Progesterone's \nopposition to those early excitatory effects of estrogen are so basic, \nthat there shouldn't be any difficulty in thinking of it as an antiestrogen, \nthat stops cell division primarily by opposing the excitatory effects \nof estrogen and other mitogens. Progesterone's opposition to the calcium-activating \nand phosphorylating effects of estrogen affects everything in the cell, \naccording to the cell's specific nature. But \nthe reductionists don't like \"nongenomic\" explanations of \nanything, even when they are triggered by the estrogen receptor rather \nthan by a membrane-event. So, to argue that progesterone's opposition \nto estrogen is general, it's necessary to examine each of estrogen's \nactions, where those actions are clearly known, and to evaluate progesterone's \neffects on the same events. When \na cell is stimulated or slightly stressed, homeostatic mechanisms are \nactivated that help it to return to its normal resting state. The mobilization \nof calcium and the phosphorylation system is followed by increased synthesis \nof cholesterol and the formation of glucose from glycogen. Cholesterol \nitself is protective, and in some cells it is massively converted into \nprogesterone, which is even more effective in restoring homeostasis. In \nthe ovary, the enzymes that synthesize cholesterol, along with the production \nof progesterone, are activated by the pituitary hormone, FSH, but also \nby estrogen. In the liver and uterus and vascular endothelium, which \naren't specialized for the production of progesterone, stimulation by \nestrogen activates the enzymes to increase the formation of cholesterol. When \ncells are injured or seriously stressed, instead of being able to directly \nrecover their normal quiescence, they may instead mobilize their systems \nfor growing and replicating, to replace damaged or destroyed cells. Prolonged \nexposure to estrogen, that can't be offset by the homeostatic factors, \nsuch as progesterone, typically causes cells to enter a growth phase. \n(But so do other excitatory processes, such as ionizing radiation.) One \nof the basic reactions to injury is to shift the cell away from oxidative \nmetabolism to glycolytic metabolism, which is inefficient, but can support \ncell division. Chemical stains show that during cell division cells \nare in a reduced state, with abundant sulfhydryl groups including reduced \nglutathione and protein sulfhydryls. This shift in itself increases \nthe formation of active estradiol from estrone. In \nthe inflamed or estrogen dominated cell, enzymes such as the cyclooxidases \n(COX), that convert arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, are activated. \nBeta-glucuronidase and sulfatases are activated, and these cause intracellular \nestrogen to increase, by removing the water soluble sulfate and glucuronate \nportions from estrogens that had been inactivated. The detoxifying enzymes \nthat attach those molecules to estrogen are inactivated in the estrogen \ndominated cell. The prostaglandin formed from arachidonic acid stimulates \nthe formation of the enzyme aromatase or estrogen synthetase, that converts \nandrogens into estrogen. Those \nprocesses, initiated by excitation or injury, increase the amount of \nestrogen in the cell, which intensifies the excitation. Progesterone \nopposes all of those processes, decreasing the amount of estrogen in \nthe cell by modifying the activities of those five types of enzyme. Although \nmany kinds of protein (including enzymes) bind estrogen, the protein \nthat Jensen called \"the estrogen receptor\" is largely responsible \nfor the ability of the uterus and breasts to retain high concentrations \nof estrogen. Various kinds of stimulation or stress (including heat \nand oxygen deprivation) cause its appearance, and estrogen itself increases \nthe amount of the estrogen receptor in a cell. The estrogen receptor \ndoesn't just \"activate genes,\" as the Jensen dogma claimed. \nFor example, the estrogen receptor directly binds and inactivates the \n\n\"tumor suppressor\" p53 protein, which otherwise would restrain \nthe replication of damaged cells. Progesterone \ncauses the estrogen receptor to be eliminated. (Batra; Boling and Blandau; \nResko, et al.) Among \nthe cell activating factors, other than estrogen, are proteins that \nare considered to be \"oncogenes,\" because of their involvement \nin cancer. Several of these proteins are activated by estrogen, inhibited \nby progesterone. The term \"oncogene\" refers to any gene that \ncontributes to the development of cancer, but it is so burdened by ideology \nthat it shouldn't be used as if it had a simple clear meaning. A \nvariety of proteins promote cell activity and replication, under the \ninfluence of estrogen. The \"composite transcription factor activating \nprotein 1,\" AP-1 which integrates the effects of other transcription \nfactors, is important in a variety of cell types, and its activity is \nincreased by estrogen and decreased by progesterone. When \nthe \"progesterone receptor\"lacks progesterone,it \nhas the opposite effect of progesterone, and this feature has been used \npropagandistically, by infecting cells with a virus carrying the progesterone \nreceptor protein, and then suggesting that the disturbed functions of \nthe cell reflect a potential effect of progesterone. The receptor, lacking \nprogesterone, tells the cell that it has a progesterone deficiency, \nbut too many molecular endocrinologists are trying to say that the receptor \nprotein is the same as the progesterone. The \ngenerality of the process of excitation/activation can be clearly seen \nin the effects of the nerve-inhibiting GABA and the nerve-exciting glutamate \nor NMDA. In cultured breast cancer cells, GABA inhibits growth, NMDA \nincreases growth. As in the brain, progesterone supports the actions \nof GABA, and opposes those of NMDA or the excitatory amino acids, while \nestrogen in general promotes the effects of the excitatory amino acids, \nand opposes those of GABA. Both the excitatory amino acids and a peptide that promotes inflammation, \ntumor necrosis factor (TNF), activate the enzyme which makes estrogen, \naromatase. Estrogen, by activating NF kappaB, increases the formation \nof TNF, which in itself can promote the growth and metastasis of cancer. \nVarious antiinflammatory agents, including aspirin, progesterone, testosterone, \nsaturated fats, and glycine, can inhibit the production of NF kappaB. An \nenzyme that has been thought of mainly in relation to the brain is catechol-O-methyl \ntransferase, which is inhibited by estrogen (producing effects similar \nto cocaine), leading to brain excitation.The enzyme detoxifies catecholestrogen \n(Creveling, 2003), protecting cells from DNA damage (Lavigne, et al., \n2001). When the activity of this enzyme is low, there is increased risk \nof breast cancer (Matsui, et al., 2000). Progesterone increases its \nactivity (Inoue and Creveling, 1991, 1995). Another \nenzyme system that affects the body's reactions to stress and modifies \nprocesses of inflammation and growth, the monoamino-oxidases, is affected \noppositely by estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen's effects are partly \nmediated by increased formation of serotonin, progesterone's, by decreasing \nit. Histamine is another promoter of inflammation that is increased \nby estrogen, decreased by progesterone. Estrogen's \neffects in the nervous system go beyond the production of cocaine-like \nhypomania, or chorea, or epilepsy, and include the activation of the \nbasic stress hormones, increasing the formation in the hypothalamus \nof pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which is a precursor of ACTH to activate \nthe adrenals, and endorphins (\"endogenous opiates\"), which \nstimulate growth processes. Both endorphins and ACTH can be found in \ntumors such as breast cancer. The ACTH stimulates the production of \ncortisol, that protects against some of the immediate causes of inflammation \nand growth, but that contributes to the loss of resistance, and increases \nestrogen synthesis. A \nprotein called the sigma receptor, known for its role in cocaine's action, \nbinds progesterone, and can inhibit the growth of cancer. Some anesthetics \nhave similar effects on tumors, acting through this protein. The sigma \nreceptor, in association with progesterone or pregnenolone, is protective \nagainst the excitatory amino acids. The \nextracellular medium changes during the development of a tumor. Irritated \nhypoxic cells, and estrogen-stimulated cells, increase their production \nof collagen, and the increase of collagen interferes with normal cell \nfunctions. Progesterone reduces the formation of collagen, and probably \ncontributes to its removal. Naloxone \nor naltrexone, which blocks the actions of the endorphins and morphine, \nis being used to inhibit the growth of various kinds of cancer, including \nbreast cancer and prostate cancer. Leptin (which is promoted by estrogen) \nis a hormone produced by fat cells, and it, like estrogen, activates \nthe POMC-related endorphin stress system. The endorphins activate histamine, \nanother promoter of inflammation and cell division. Progesterone \nopposes those various biochemical effects of estrogen in multiple ways, \nfor example by inhibiting the ACTH stress response, by restraining cortisol's \nharmful actions, and by inhibiting leptin. Mediators \nof the radiation bystander effect include NO, TNF, COX, and prostaglandins. \nThese are produced by other things that cause inflammation and injury, \nincluding estrogen. Cell \ndivision, when it is part of the body's continuous renewal and adaptation,  \nisn't a source of mutations or degeneration, but when it is induced \nby the mediators of inflammation produced in response to injury, it \nleads to inherited changes, loss of differentiated function, and eventually \nto genetic instability. When \ncell division is so disturbed that the number of chromosomes becomes \nabnormal, the instability of these cells decreases their ability to \nsurvive, but when the causes of the inflammation persist, they will \ncontinue to be replaced by other abnormal cells. The toxic products \nof dying cells can reach a point at which the debris can't be removed, \nadding to the injury and inflammation. The damaged bystander cells spread \ntheir influence through a cancer field, injuring more cells. One \nof the \"field\" effects of cancer is the stimulation of new \nblood vessel development, angiogenesis. Lactic acid stimulates the formation \nof new blood vessels, the secretion of collagen, and tumor growth. Low \noxygen, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, prostaglandins and other products \nof tissue stress can stimulate the growth of new blood vessels, at the \nsame time that they stimulate tumor growth and impair oxidative metabolism. \nSeveral of these agents promote each other's activity. Therapeutic \nthinking has been influenced by the doctrine of the mutant cell as the \ninitiator of cancer, leading to the idea that only things which kill \nthe cancer cells can cure cancer. But when the body stops activating \nthe processes of inflammation and growth, normal processes of tissue \nrepair have an opportunity to eliminate the tumor. Even the fibroblasts \nwhich normally secrete collagen can participate in its removal (Simoes, \net al., 1984). Something as simple as eliminating lactate can change \ntheir functions. Although \nthe angiogenic action of lactate has been known for several decades, \nsome researchers believed that a specific anti-angiogenic peptide could \nbe found which would stop the growth of cancer cells. The interest in \nangiogenesis tacitly acknowledges that there is a cancer field, but \nthe faith that cancer could be cured only by killing the mutant cells \nseems to have guided the search for a single antiangiogenic substance. \nSuch a substance would be toxic to normal tissues, since blood vessels \nare constantly being renewed. The \nmore advanced a tumor is, the more numerous the growth-promoting factors \nare likely to be, and the weaker the body's ability becomes to control \nthem. The \nsearch for toxic factors to kill the cancer cells is unlikely to lead \nto a generally effective treatment. Even immunological approaches that \nthink in terms of destroying a tumor might be misconceiving the nature \nof the problem. For example, the protein called \"tumor necrosis \nfactor\" (TNF) or cachectin was discovered as a result of Lawrence \nBurton's work in the 1960s. He extracted proteins from the blood that \ncould shrink some tumors in mice with amazing speed. In the right setting, \nTNF is involved in the destruction of tumors, but when other factors \nare missing, it can make them worse. Burton was focussing on factors \nin the immune system that could destroy cancer, but he ignored the basic \nproblem of tissue degeneration that produces tumors which are complex \nand changing. If \nthe cancer-productive field is taken into account, all of the factors \nthat promote and sustain that field should be considered during therapy. Two \nubiquitous carcinogenic factors that can be manipulated without toxins \nare the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and estrogen. These closely \ninteract with each other, and there are many ways in which they can \nbe modulated. For \nexample, keeping cells in a well oxygenated state with thyroid hormone \nand carbon dioxide will shift the balance from estradiol toward the \nweaker estrone. The thyroid stimulation will cause the liver to excrete \nestrogen more quickly, and will help to prevent the formation of aromatase \nin the tissues. Low temperature is one of the factors that increases \nthe formation of estrogen. Lactic acid, serotonin, nitric oxide, prostaglandins, \nand the endorphins will be decreased by the shift toward efficient oxidative \nmetabolism. Progesterone \nsynthesis will be increased by the higher metabolic rate, and will tend \nto keep the temperature higher. Thyroid \nhormone, by causing a shift away from estrogen and serotonin, lowers \nprolactin, which is involved in the promotion of several kinds of cancer. Vitamin \nD and vitamin K have some antiestrogenic effects. Vitamin D and calcium \nlower the inflammation-promoting parathyroid hormone (PTH). Eliminating \npolyunsaturated fats from the diet is essential if the bystander effect \nis eventually to be restrained. Aspirin and salicylic acid can block \nmany of the carcinogenic effects of the PUFA. Saturated fats have a \nvariety of antiinflammatory and anticancer actions. Some of those effects \nare direct, others are the result of blocking the toxic effects of the \nPUFA. Keeping the stored unsaturated fats from circulating in the blood \nis helpful, since it takes years to eliminate them from the tissues \nafter the diet has changed. Niacinamide inhibits lipolysis. Avoiding \nover-production of lipolytic adrenaline requires adequate thyroid hormone, \nand the adjustment of the diet to minimize fluctuations of blood sugar. The \nendorphins are antagonistic to progesterone, and when they are minimized, \nprogesterone tends to increase, and to be more effective. The drugs \nnaloxone and naltrexone, which block the effects of the endorphins, \nhave several remarkable effects that resemble progesterone's. Naltrexone \nhas been successfully used to treat prostate and breast cancer. Opiates \nare still commonly used for pain relief in cancer patients, despite \nthe evidence that has accumulated for several decades indicating that \nthey promote inflammation and cancer growth, while suppressing immunity \nand causing tissue catabolism, exacerbating the wasting that commonly \noccurs with cancer. Their use, rather than alternatives such as procaine, \naspirin, and progesterone, is nothing but a medical fetish. Stress \nand estrogen tend to produce alkalosis, while thyroid, carbon dioxide, \nand adequate protein in the diet help to prevent alkalosis. Antihistamines \nand some of the antiserotonin drugs (including \"dopaminergic\" \nlisuride and bromocriptine) are sometimes useful in cancer treatment, \nbut the safe way to lower serotonin is to reduce the consumption of \ntryptophan, and to avoid excessive cortisol production (which mobilizes \ntryptophan from the muscles). Pregnenolone and sucrose tend to prevent \nover-production of cortisol. In \nthe breast, COX-2 converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which \nactivate the enzyme aromatase, that forms estrogen from androgens. Until \nthe tissues are free of PUFA, aspirin and salicylic acid can be used \nto stop prostaglandin synthesis. Thyroid \nis needed to keep the cell in an oxidative, rather than reductive state, \nand progesterone (which is produced elsewhere only when cells are in \na rapidly oxidizing state) activates the processes that remove estrogen \nfrom the cell, and inactivates the processes that would form new estrogen \nin the cell. Thyroid, \nand the carbon dioxide it produces, prevent the formation of the toxic \nlactic acid. When there is enough carbon dioxide in the tissues, the \ncell is kept in an oxidative state, and the formation of toxic free \nradicals is suppressed. Carbon dioxide therapy is extremely safe. In \nthe 1930s, primates as well as rodents had been used in experiments \nto show the carcinogenic effects of estrogen, and the protective effects \nof progesterone. By \n1950, the results of animal studies of progesterone's anticancer effects \nwere so clear that the National Cancer Institute got involved. But the \nestrogen industry had already been conducting its campaign against progesterone, \nand had convinced most doctors that it was inactive when taken orally, \nand so was inferior to their proprietary drugs that they called \"progestins.\" \nThe result was that it was usually given by injection, dissolved in \nvegetable oil or synthetic solvents such as benzyl benzoate or benzyl \nalcohol, which are very toxic and inflammation-producing. The \nNCI researchers (Hertz, et al., 1951) treated 17 women with visible \ncancers of the uterine cervix that had been confirmed by biopsies. They \nwere given daily intramuscular injections of 250 mg of progesterone \nin vegetable oil. Although they described the treatment as \"massive \ndosage with progesterone,\" it didn't prevent menstruation in any \nof the women who had been menstruating before the treatment began. During \na healthy pregnancy, a woman produces more progesterone than that. Their \narticle includes some photographs of cervical tumors before treatment, \nand after 31 days, 50 days, and 65 days of progesterone treatment. The \nimprovement is clear. The examining physicians described softening of \nthe tumor, and stopping of bleeding and pain. \"In \neleven of the 17 treated patients visible and palpable evidence of regressive \nalteration of the tumor mass could be demonstrated. This consisted of \n(a) distinct reduction in size of the visible portion of the cancer \nas well as reduction of the palpable extent of the mass, (b) reduction \nin vascularity and friability of the visible lesion with a clearly demonstrable \nepithelization of previously raw surfaces and (c) markedly increased \npliability of the previously rigid and infiltrated parametria.\" \"In \n10 cases there was associated with this type of gross change a reduction \nin, or complete cessation of vaginal bleeding and discharge.\" \"Only \none of the 17 patients showed active progression of the carcinomatous \nprocess while under the progesterone administration. The six patients \nwhose lesions failed to show clearly demonstrable regressive changes \nshowed minor alterations in size and vascularity of insufficient degree \nto be convincing to all clinical observers concerned. Nevertheless, \nnone of the lesions under study appeared to be accelerated by progesterone.\" Observing \nvery similar patients under similar conditions while they were waiting \nfor surgery, but were not receiving progesterone, they saw no such regressions \nof tumors. The \nphotographs and descriptions of the changes in the tumors were remarkable \nfor any cancer study, but to have been produced by a treatment that \ndidn't even alter the patients' menstrual cycle, the reader might expect \nthe authors to discuss their plans for further studies of such a successful \nmethod. But \ninstead, they concluded \"We do not consider the regressive changes \nobserved to be sufficient to indicate the use of progesterone as a therapeutic \nagent in carcinoma of the cervix.\" (Their \nresearch was supported by a grant from the American Cancer Society.) If \nthe researchers had bothered to test progesterone on themselves or on \nanimals, they would have discovered that it is fully active when taken \norally, dissolved in oil, and that nontoxic saturated fats could have \nbeen used. Progesterone anesthesia was very well known at that time, \nso it would have been reasonable to use doses that were at least equivalent \nto the concentrations present during pregnancy, even if they didn't \nwant to use doses that would approach the anesthetic level. The total \ndaily doses could have been about ten times higher, if they had been \ngiven orally as divided doses. The \nsolvent issue continues to impede research in the use of progesterone \nfor treating cancer, but the main problem is the continuing belief that \n\"the cancer cell\" is the problem, rather than the cancer field. \nSubstances are tested for their ability to kill cancer cellsin vitro, \nbecause of the basic belief that mutated genes are the cause of the \ndisease. When progesterone is tested on cancer cellsin vitro,the experimenter often sees nothing but the effects of the solvent, \nand doesn't realize that nearly all of the progesterone has precipitated \nin the medium, before reaching the cancer cells. The \ncancer industry began a few years ago to combine chemicals for chemotherapy, \nfor example adding caffeine to paclitaxel or platinum (cisplatin), or \nhistamine to doxorubicin, but they do it simply to increase the toxicity \nof the chemical to the tumor, or to decrease its toxicity to the patient. \nDoctors sometimes refer to combined chemotherapy as a \"shotgun \napproach,\" meaning that it lacks the acumen of their ideal silver \nbullet approach. If cancers were werewolves, the cancer industry's search \nfor more refined killing technologies might be going in the right direction. \nBut the genetic doctrine of cancer's origin is just as mythical as werewolves \nand vampires. A \nsafe physiological approach to cancer, based on the opposition of progesterone \nto estrogen, would be applicable to every type of cancer promoted by \nestrogen, or by factors which produce the same effects as estrogen, \nand that would include all of the known types of cancer. Estrogen acts \neven on cells that have no \"estrogen receptors,\" but estrogen \nreceptors can be found in every organ. As \nestrogen's non-feminizing actions are increasingly being recognized \nto include contributions to other kinds of disease, including Alzheimer's \ndisease, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, the idea of the bystander \neffect, and the field of cellular degeneration, will eventually clear \nthe way for a rational use of the therapeutic tools that already exist. There \nare several types of drug---carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, to increase \ncarbon dioxide in the tissues, lysergic acid derivatives, to block serotonin \nand suppress prolactin, anti-opiates, antiexcitotoxic and GABAergic \nagents, anesthetics, antihistamines, anticholinergics, salicylic acid \nderivatives---that could probably be useful in a comprehensive therapy \nfor cancer, but their combinations won't be explored as long as treatments \nare designed only to kill. Preventing \nor correcting disturbances in the morphogenetic field should be the \nfocus of attention. REFERENCES © Ray Peat Ph.D. 2007. All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com",

        "chunk_html": "Protective CO2 and agingThe \r\ntherapeutic effects of increasing carbon dioxide are being more widely \r\nrecognized in recent years. Even Jane Brody, the NY Times writer on \r\nhealth topics, has favorably mentioned the use of the Buteyko method \r\nfor asthma, and the idea of permissive hypercapnia during mechanical \r\nventilation, to prevent lung damage from excess oxygen, has been discussed \r\nin medical journals. But still very few biologists recognize its role \r\nas a fundamental, universal protective factor. I think it will be helpful \r\nto consider some of the ways carbon dioxide might be controlling situations \r\nthat otherwise are poorly understood.The \r\nbrain has a high rate of oxidative metabolism, and so it forms a very \r\nlarge proportion of the carbon dioxide produced by an organism. It also \r\ngoverns, to a great extent, the metabolism of other tissues, including \r\ntheir consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide or lactic \r\nacid. Within a particular species, the rate of oxygen consumption increases \r\nin proportion to brain size, rather than body weight. Between very different \r\nspecies, the role of the brain in metabolism is even more obvious, since \r\nthe resting metabolic rate corresponds to the size of the brain. For \r\nexample, a cat's brain is about the size of a crocodile's, and their \r\noxygen consumption at rest is similar, despite their tremendous difference \r\nin body size.Stress \r\nhas to be understood as a process that develops in time, and the brain \r\n(especially the neocortex and the frontal lobes) organizes the adaptive \r\nand developmental processes in both the spatial and temporal dimensions. \r\nThe meaning of a situation influences the way the organism responds. \r\nFor example, the stress of being restrained for a long time can cause \r\nmajor gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcerization, but if the animal \r\nhas the opportunity to bite something during the stress (signifying \r\nits ability to fight back, and the possibility of escape) it can avoid \r\nthe stress ulcers.The \r\npatterning of the nervous activity throughout the body governs the local \r\nability to produce carbon dioxide. When the cortex of the brain is damaged \r\nor removed, an animal becomes rigid, so the cortex is considered to \r\nhave a tonic inhibitory action on the body. But when the nerves \r\nare removed from a muscle (for example, by disease or accident), the \r\nmuscle goes into a state of constant activity, and its ability to oxidize \r\nglucose and produce carbon dioxide is reduced, while its oxidation of \r\nfatty acids persists, increasing the production of toxic oxidative fragments \r\nof the fatty acids, which contributes to the muscle's atrophy.The \r\norganism's intentions, expectations, or plans, are represented in the \r\nnervous system as a greater readiness for action, and in the organs \r\nand tissues controlled by the nerves, as an increase or decrease of \r\noxidative efficiency, analogous to the differences between innervated \r\nand denervated muscles. This pattern in the nervous system has been \r\ncalled the acceptor of action, because it is continually being \r\ncompared with the actual situation, and being refined as the situation \r\nis evaluated. The state of the organism, under the influence of a particular \r\nacceptor of action, is called a functional system, including all \r\nthe components of the organism that participate most directly in realizing \r\nthe intended adaptive action.The \r\nactions of nerves can be considered anabolic, because during a stressful \r\nsituation in which the catabolic hormones of adaption, e.g., cortisol, \r\nincrease, the tissues of the functional system are protected, and while \r\nidle tissues may undergo autophagy or other form of involution, the \r\nneeds of the active tissues are supplied with nutrients from their breakdown, \r\nallowing them to change and, when necessary, grow in size or complexity.The \r\nbrain's role in protecting against injury by stress, when it sees a \r\ncourse of action, has a parallel in the differences between concentric \r\n(positive, muscle shortening) and eccentric (negative, lengthening under \r\ntension) exercise, and also with the differences between innervated \r\nand denervated muscles.  In eccentric exercise and denervation, \r\nless oxygen is used and less carbon dioxide is produced, while lactic \r\nacid increases, displacing carbon dioxide, and more fat is oxidized. \r\nProlonged stress similarly decreases carbon dioxide and increases lactate, \r\nwhile increasing the use of fat.Darkness \r\nis stressful and catabolic. For example, in aging people, the morning \r\nurine contains nearly all of the calcium lost during the 24 hour period, \r\nand mitochondria are especially sensitive to the destructive effects \r\nof darkness. Sleep reduces the destructive catabolic effects of darkness. \r\nDuring the rapid-eye-movement (dreaming) phase of sleep, breathing is \r\ninhibited, and the level of carbon dioxide in the tissues accumulates. \r\nIn restful sleep, the oxygen tension is frequently low enough, and the \r\ncarbon dioxide tension high enough, to trigger the multiplication of \r\nstem cells and mitochondria.Dreams \r\nrepresent the acceptor of action operating independently of the \r\nsensory information that it normally interacts with. During dreams, \r\nthe brain (using a system called the Ascending Reticular Activating \r\nSystem) disconnects itself from the sensory systems. I think this is \r\nthe nervous equivalent of concentric/positive muscle activity, in the \r\nsense that the brain is in control of its actions. The active, dreaming \r\nphase of sleep occurs more frequently in the later part of the night, \r\nas morning approaches. This is the more stressful part of the night, \r\nwith cortisol and some other stress hormones reaching a peak at dawn, \r\nso it would be reasonable for the brain's defensive processes to be \r\nmost active at that time. The dreaming process in the brain is associated \r\nwith deep muscle relaxation, which is probably associated with the trophic \r\n(restorative) actions of the nerves.In \r\nancient China the Taoists were concerned with longevity, and according \r\nto Joseph Needham (Science and Civilization in China) their methods \r\nincluded the use of herbs, minerals, and steroids extracted from the \r\nurine of children. Some of those who claimed extreme longevity practiced \r\ncontrolled breathing and tai chi (involving imagery, movement, and breating), \r\ntypically in the early morning hours, when stress reduction is most \r\nimportant. As far as I know, there are no studies of carbon dioxide \r\nlevels in practitioners of tai chi, but the sensation of warmth they \r\ntypically report suggests that it involves hypoventilation.In \r\nthe 1960s, a Russian researcher examined hospital records of measurements \r\nof newborn babies, and found that for several decades the size of their \r\nheads had been increasing. He suggested that it might be the result \r\nof increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.The \r\nexperiences and nutrition of a pregnant animal are known to affect the \r\nexpression of genes in the offspring, affecting such things as allergies, \r\nmetabolic rate, brain size, and intelligence. Miles Storfer (1999) has \r\nreviewed the evidence for epigenetic environmental control of brain \r\nsize and intelligence. The main mechanisms of epigenetic effects or \r\nimprinting are now known to involve methylation and acetylation \r\nof the chromosomes (DNA and histones).Certain \r\nkinds of behavior, as well as nutrition and other environmental factors, \r\nincrease the production and retention of carbon dioxide. The normal \r\nintrauterine level of carbon dioxide is high, and it can be increased \r\nor decreased by changes in the mother's physiology. The effects of carbon \r\ndioxide on many biological processes involving methylation and acetylation \r\nof the genetic material suggest that the concentration of carbon dioxide \r\nduring gestation might regulate the degree to which parental imprinting \r\nwill persist in the developing fetus. There is some evidence of increased \r\ndemethylation associated with the low level of oxygen in the uterus \r\n(Wellman, et al., 2008). A high metabolic rate and production of carbon \r\ndioxide would increase the adaptability of the new organism, by decreasing \r\nthe limiting genetic imprints.A \r\nquick reduction of carbon dioxide caused by hyperventilation can provoke \r\nan epileptic seizure, and can increase muscle spasms and vascular leakiness, \r\nand (by releasing serotonin and histamine) contribute to inflammation \r\nand clotting disorders. On a slightly longer time scale, a reduction \r\nof carbon dioxide can increase the production of lactic acid, which \r\nis a promoter of inflammation and fibrosis. A prolonged decrease in \r\ncarbon dioxide can increase the susceptibility of proteins to glycation \r\n(the addition of aldehydes, from polyunsaturated fat peroxidation or \r\nmethylglyoxal from lactate metabolism, to amino groups), and a similar \r\nprocess is likely to contribute to the methylation of histones, a process \r\nthat increases with aging. Histones regulate genetic activity.With \r\naging, DNA methylation is increased (Bork, et al., 2009).I suggest \r\nthat methylation stabilizes and protects cells when growth and regeneration \r\naren't possible (and that it's likely to increase when CO2 isn't available).Hibernation (Morin and Storey, 2009) and sporulation (Ruiz-Herrera, \r\n1994; Clancy, et al., 2002) appear to use methylation protectively.Parental \r\nstress, prenatal stress, early life stress, and even stress in adulthood \r\ncontribute to imprinting of the genes, partly through methylation \r\nof DNA and the histones.Methionine \r\nand choline are the main dietary sources of methyl donors. Restriction \r\nof methionine has many protective effects, including increased average \r\n(42%) and maximum (44%) longevity in rats (Richie, et al., 1994). Restriction \r\nof methyl donors causes demethylation of DNA (Epner, 2001).The age accelerating effect of methionine might be related to disturbing \r\nthe methylation balance, inappropriately suppressing cellular activity. \r\nBesides its effect on the methyl pool, methionine inhibits thyroid function \r\nand damages mitochondria.The \r\nlocal concentration of carbon dioxide in specific tissues and organs \r\ncan be adjusted by nervous and hormonal activation or inhibition of \r\nthe carbonic anhydrase enzymes, that accelerate the oonversion of CO2 \r\nto carbonic acid, H2CO3. The activity of carbonic anhydrase can determine \r\nthe density and strength of the skeleton, the excitability of nerves, \r\nthe accumulation of water, and can regulate the structure and function \r\nof the tissues and organs.Ordinarily, \r\ncarbon dioxide and bicarbonate are thought of only in relation to the \r\nregulation of pH, and only in a very general way. Because of the importance \r\nof keeping the pH of the blood within a narrow range, carbon dioxide \r\nis commonly thought of as a toxin, because an excess can cause unconsciousness \r\nand acidosis. But increasing carbon dioxide doesn't necessarily cause \r\nacidosis, and acidosis caused by carbon dioxide isn't as harmful as \r\nlactic acidosis.Frogs \r\nand toads, being amphibians, are especially dependent on water, and \r\nin deserts or areas with a dry season they can survive a prolonged dry \r\nperiod by burrowing into mud or sand. Since they may be buried 10 or \r\n11 inches below the surface, they are rarely found, and so haven't been \r\nextensively studied. In species that live in the California desert, \r\nthey have been known to survive 5 years of burial without rainfall, \r\ndespite a moderately warm average temperature of their surroundings. \r\nOne of their known adaptations is to produce a high level of urea, allowing \r\nthem to osmotically absorb and retain water. (Very old people sometimes \r\nhave extremely high urea and osmotic tension.)Some \r\nlaboratory studies show that as a toad burrows into mud, the amount \r\nof carbon dioxide in its tissues increases. Their skin normally functions \r\nlike a lung, exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide. If the toad's nostrils \r\nare at the surface of the mud, as dormancy begins its breathing will \r\ngradually slow, increasing the carbon dioxide even more. Despite the \r\nincreasing carbon dioxide, the pH is kept stable by an increase of bicarbonate \r\n(Boutilier, et al., 1979). A similar increase of bicarbonate has been \r\nobserved in hibernating hamsters and doormice.Thinking \r\nabout the long dormancy of frogs reminded me of a newspaper story I \r\nread in the 1950s. Workers breaking up an old concrete structure found \r\na dormant toad enclosed in the concrete, and it revived soon after being \r\nreleased. The concrete had been poured decades earlier.Although \r\nsystematic study of frogs or toads during their natural buried estivation \r\nhas been very limited, there have been many reports of accidental discoveries \r\nthat suggest that the dormant state might be extended indefinitely if \r\nconditions are favorable. Carbon dioxide has antioxidant effects, and \r\nmany other stabilizing actions, including protection against hypoxia \r\nand the excitatory effects of intracellular calcium and inflammation \r\n(Baev, et al., 1978, 1995; Bari, et al., 1996; Brzecka, 2007; Kogan, \r\net al., 1994; Malyshev, et al., 1995).When \r\nmitochondria are uncoupled, they produce more carbon dioxide than \r\nnormal, and the mitochondria produce fewer free radicals. Animals with \r\nuncoupled mitochondria live longer than animals with the ordinary, more \r\nefficient mitochondria, that produce more reactive oxidative fragments. \r\nOne effect of the high rate of oxidation of the uncoupled mitochondria \r\nis that they can eliminate polyunsatured fatty acids that might otherwise \r\nbe integrated into tissue structures, or function as inappropriate regulatory \r\nsignals.Birds \r\nhave a higher metabolic rate than mammals of the same size, and live \r\nlonger. Their tissues contain fewer of the highly unsaturated fatty \r\nacids. Queen bees, which live many times longer than worker bees, have \r\nmainly monounsaturated fats in their tissues, while the tissues of the \r\nshort-lived worker bees, receiving a different diet, within a couple \r\nof weeks of hatching will contain highly unsaturated fats.Bats \r\nhave a very high metabolic rate, and an extremely long lifespan for \r\nan animal of their size. While most animals of their small size live \r\nonly a few years, many bats live a few decades. Bat caves usually have \r\nslightly more carbon dioxide than the outside atmosphere, but they usually \r\ncontain a large amount of ammonia, and bats maintain a high serum level \r\nof carbon dioxide, which protects them from the otherwise toxic effects \r\nof the ammonia.The naked mole rat, another small animal with an extremely long lifespan \r\n(in captivity they have lived up to 30 years, 9 or 10 times longer than \r\nmice of the same size) has a low basal metabolic rate, but I think measurements \r\nmade in laboratories might not represent their metabolic rate in their \r\nnatural habitat. They live in burrows that are kept closed, so the percentage \r\nof oxygen is lower than in the outside air, and the percentage of carbon \r\ndioxide ranges from 0.2% to 5% (atmospheric CO2 is about 0.038). The \r\ntemperature and humidity in their burrows can be extremely high, and \r\nto be very meaningful their metabolic rate would have to be measured \r\nwhen their body temperature is raised by the heat in the burrow.When \r\nthey have been studied in Europe and the US, there has been no investigation \r\nof the effect of altitude on their metabolism, and these animals are \r\nnative to the high plains of Kenya and Ethiopia, where the low atmospheric \r\npressure would be likely to increase the level of carbon dioxide in \r\ntheir tissues. Consequently, I doubt that the longevity seen in laboratory \r\nsituations accurately reflects the longevity of the animals in their \r\nnormal habitat.Besides \r\nliving in a closed space with a high carbon dioxide content, mole rats \r\nhave another similarity to bees. In each colony, there is only one female \r\nthat reproduces, the queen, and, like a queen bee, she is the largest \r\nindividual in the colony. In beehives, the workers carefully regulate \r\nthe carbon dioxide concentration, which varies from about 0.2% to 6%, \r\nsimilar to that of the mole rat colony. A high carbon dioxide content \r\nactivates the ovaries of a queen bee, increasing her fertility.Since \r\nqueen bees and mole rats live in the dark, I think their high carbon \r\ndioxide compensates for the lack of light. (Both light and CO2 help \r\nto maintain oxidative metabolism and inhibit lactic acid formation.) \r\nMole rats are believed to sleep very little. During the night, normal \r\npeople tolerate more CO2, and so breathe less, especially near morning, \r\nwith increased active dreaming sleep.A mole rat has never been known to develop cancer. Their serum C-reactive \r\nprotein is extremely low, indicating that they are resistant to inflammation. \r\nIn humans and other animals that are susceptible to cancer, one of the \r\ngenes that is likely to be silenced by stress, aging, and methylation \r\nis p53, a tumor-suppressor gene.If \r\nthe intrauterine experience, with low oxygen and high carbon dioxide, \r\nserves to reprogram cells to remove the accumulated effects of \r\nage and stress, and so to maximize the developmental potential of the \r\nnew organism, a life that's lived with nearly those levels of oxygen \r\nand carbon dioxide might be able to avoid the progressive silencing \r\nof genes and loss of function that cause aging and degenerative diseases.Several \r\ndiseases and syndromes are now thought to involve abnormal methylation \r\nof genes. Prader-Willi sydrome, Angelman's syndrome, and various autistic \r\nspectrum disorders, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and \r\nseveral kinds of cancer seem to involve excess methylation.Moderate \r\nmethionine restriction (for example, using gelatin regularly in the \r\ndiet) might be practical, but if increased carbon dioxide can activate \r\nthe demethylase enzymes in a controlled way, it might be a useful treatment \r\nfor the degenerative diseases and for aging itself.The \r\nlow carbon dioxide production of hypothyroidism (e.g., Lee and Levine, \r\n1999), and the respiratory alkalosis of estrogen excess, are often overlooked. \r\nAn adequate supply of calcium, and sometimes supplementation of salt \r\nand baking soda, can increase the tissue content of CO2.REFERENCESAm \r\nJ Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 2009 Apr;296(4):E621-7.Uncoupling protein-2 \r\nregulates lifespan in mice.Andrews ZB, Horvath TL.Fiziol \r\nZh SSSR 1978 Oct;64(10):1456-62.[Role of CO2 fixation in increasing \r\nthe body's resistance to acute hypoxia].Baev VI, Vasil'ev VV, Nikolaeva \r\nEN. In rats, the phenomenon of considerable increase in resistance to \r\nacute hypoxia observed after 2-hour stay under conditions of gradually \r\nincreasing concentration of CO2, decreasing concentration of O2, and \r\nexternal cooling at 2--3 degrees seems to be based mainly on changes \r\nin concentration of CO2 (ACCORDINGLY, PCO2 and other forms of CO2 in \r\nthe blood). The high resistance to acute hypoxia develops as well after \r\nsubcutaneous or i.v. administration of 1.0 ml of water solution (169.2 \r\nmg/200 g) NaHCO2, (NH4)2SO4, MgSO4, MnSO4, and ZnSO4 (in proportion: \r\n35 : 5 : 2 : 0.15 : 0.15, resp.) or after 1-hour effect of increased \r\nhypercapnia and hypoxia without cooling.Fiziol \r\nZh Im I M Sechenova 1995 Feb;81(2):47-52.[The unknown physiological \r\nrole of carbon dioxide].Baev VI, Vasil'eva IV, L'vov SN, Shugalei \r\nIV [The data suggests that carbon dioxide is a natural element of the \r\norganism antioxidant defence system. ion poisoning].Stroke. \r\n1996 Sep;27(9):1634-9; discussion 1639-40.Differential effects of \r\nshort-term hypoxia and hypercapnia on N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced cerebral \r\nvasodilatation in piglets.Bari F, Errico RA, Louis TM, Busija DW.Vojnosanit \r\nPregl.  1996 Jul-Aug;53(4):261-74.[Carbon dioxide inhibits \r\nthe generation of active forms of oxygen in human and animal cells and \r\nthe significance of the phenomenon in biology and medicine][Article \r\nin Serbian] Boljevic S, Kogan AH, Gracev SV, Jelisejeva SV, Daniljak \r\nIG.J \r\nExp Biol. 1979 Oct;82:357-65.Acid-base relationships in the blood \r\nof the toad, Bufo marinus.

Adaptive \r\nmechanisms may diminish the detrimental effects of recurrent nocturnal \r\nhypoxia in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The potential role of elevated \r\ncarbon dioxide (CO2) in improving brain oxygenation in the patients \r\nwith severe OSA syndrome is discussed. CO2 increases oxygen uptake by \r\nits influence on the regulation of alveolar ventilation and ventilation-perfusion \r\nmatching, facilitates oxygen delivery to the tissues by changing the \r\naffinity of oxygen to hemoglobin, and increases cerebral blood flow \r\nby effects on arterial blood pressure and on cerebral vessels. Recent \r\nclinical studies show improved brain oxygenation when hypoxia is combined \r\nwith hypercapnia. Anti-inflammatory and protective against organ injury \r\nproperties of CO2 may also have therapeutic importance. These biological \r\neffects of hypercapnia may improve brain oxygenation under hypoxic conditions. \r\nThis may be especially important in patients with severe OSA syndrome.Ageing \r\nRes Rev. 2009 Oct;8(4):268-76.

Overall, they display increased sensitivity \r\nto anesthetics, higher incidence of perioperative cardiovascular morbidity, \r\nincreased risks for postoperative ventilatory failure and other physiological \r\nderangements. The previously described physiological basis for the increased \r\nincidence of postoperative ventilatory failure in hypothyroid patients \r\nincludes decreased central and peripheral ventilatory responses to hypercarbia \r\nand hypoxia, muscle weakness, depressed central respiratory drive, and \r\nresultant alveolar hypoventilation. These ventilatory failures are associated \r\nmost frequently with severe hypoxia and carbon dioxide (CO2) retention. \r\nThe purpose of this clinical report is to discuss an interesting and \r\nunique anesthetic presentation of a patient with severe hypothyroidism. \r\nCLINICAL FEATURES: We describe an unique presentation of ventilatory \r\nfailure in a 58 yr old man with severe hypothyroidism. He had exceedingly \r\nlow perioperative respiratory rate (3-4 bpm) and minute ventilation \r\nvolume, and at the same time developed primary acute respiratory alkalosis \r\nand associated hypocarbia (P(ET)CO2 approximately 320-22 mmHg). CONCLUSION: \r\nOur patient's ventilatory failure was based on unacceptably low minute \r\nventilation and respiratory rate that was unable to sustain adequate \r\noxygenation. His profoundly lowered basal metabolic rate and decreased \r\nCO2 production, resulting probably from severe hypothyroidism, may have \r\nresulted in development of acute respiratory alkalosis in spite of concurrently \r\ndiminished minute ventilation.Anal \r\nBioanal Chem. 2008 Jan;390(2):679-88.

The orchestrated \r\nexpression of genes is essential for the development and survival of \r\nevery organism. In addition to the role of transcription factors, the \r\navailability of genes for transcription is controlled by a series of \r\nproteins that regulate epigenetic chromatin remodeling. The two most \r\nstudied epigenetic phenomena are DNA methylation and histone-tail modifications. \r\nAlthough a large body of literature implicates the deregulation of histone \r\nacetylation and DNA methylation with the pathogenesis of cancer, recently \r\nepigenetic mechanisms have also gained much attention in the neuroscientific \r\ncommunity. In fact, a new field of research is rapidly emerging and \r\nthere is now accumulating evidence that the molecular machinery that \r\nregulates histone acetylation and DNA methylation is intimately involved \r\nin synaptic plasticity and is essential for learning and memory. Importantly, \r\ndysfunction of epigenetic gene expression in the brain might be involved \r\nin neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. In particular, it was \r\nfound that inhibition of histone deacetylases attenuates synaptic and \r\nneuronal loss in animal models for various neurodegenerative diseases \r\nand improves cognitive function. In this article, we will summarize \r\nrecent data in the novel field of neuroepigenetics and discuss the question \r\nwhy epigenetic strategies are suitable therapeutic approaches for the \r\ntreatment of brain diseases.Ukr \r\nBiokhim Zh 1994 Jan-Feb;66(1):109-12.[Protective effect of sodium \r\nbicarbonate in nitrite ion poisoning].Shugalei IV, L'vov SN, Baev \r\nVI, Tselinskii IVAm \r\nJ Respir Crit Care Med.  2000 Mar;161(3 Pt 1):891-8.Modulation \r\nof release of reactive oxygen species by the contracting diaphragm.Stofan DA, Callahan LA, DiMarco AF, Nethery DE, Supinski GS.Ecology: \r\nVol. 50, No. 3, pp. 492-494.Carbon Dioxide Retention: A Mechanism \r\nof Ammonia Tolerance in Mammals.Studier EM and Fresquez AA.Sci \r\nSignal. 2009 Mar 31;2(64): pe17.Reversing DNA methylation: new insights \r\nfrom neuronal activity-induced Gadd45b in adult neurogenesis.Wu H, Sun YE.

Even Jane Brody, the NY Times writer on \r\nhealth topics, has favorably mentioned the use of the Buteyko method \r\nfor asthma, and the idea of permissive hypercapnia during mechanical \r\nventilation, to prevent lung damage from excess oxygen, has been discussed \r\nin medical journals. But still very few biologists recognize its role \r\nas a fundamental, universal protective factor. I think it will be helpful \r\nto consider some of the ways carbon dioxide might be controlling situations \r\nthat otherwise are poorly understood. The \r\nbrain has a high rate of oxidative metabolism, and so it forms a very \r\nlarge proportion of the carbon dioxide produced by an organism. It also \r\ngoverns, to a great extent, the metabolism of other tissues, including \r\ntheir consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide or lactic \r\nacid. Within a particular species, the rate of oxygen consumption increases \r\nin proportion to brain size, rather than body weight. Between very different \r\nspecies, the role of the brain in metabolism is even more obvious, since \r\nthe resting metabolic rate corresponds to the size of the brain. For \r\nexample, a cat's brain is about the size of a crocodile's, and their \r\noxygen consumption at rest is similar, despite their tremendous difference \r\nin body size. Stress \r\nhas to be understood as a process that develops in time, and the brain \r\n(especially the neocortex and the frontal lobes) organizes the adaptive \r\nand developmental processes in both the spatial and temporal dimensions. \r\nThe meaning of a situation influences the way the organism responds. \r\nFor example, the stress of being restrained for a long time can cause \r\nmajor gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcerization, but if the animal \r\nhas the opportunity to bite something during the stress (signifying \r\nits ability to fight back, and the possibility of escape) it can avoid \r\nthe stress ulcers. The \r\npatterning of the nervous activity throughout the body governs the local \r\nability to produce carbon dioxide. When the cortex of the brain is damaged \r\nor removed, an animal becomes rigid, so the cortex is considered to \r\nhave a tonic inhibitory action on the body. But when the nerves \r\nare removed from a muscle (for example, by disease or accident), the \r\nmuscle goes into a state of constant activity, and its ability to oxidize \r\nglucose and produce carbon dioxide is reduced, while its oxidation of \r\nfatty acids persists, increasing the production of toxic oxidative fragments \r\nof the fatty acids, which contributes to the muscle's atrophy. The \r\norganism's intentions, expectations, or plans, are represented in the \r\nnervous system as a greater readiness for action, and in the organs \r\nand tissues controlled by the nerves, as an increase or decrease of \r\noxidative efficiency, analogous to the differences between innervated \r\nand denervated muscles. This pattern in the nervous system has been \r\ncalled the acceptor of action, because it is continually being \r\ncompared with the actual situation, and being refined as the situation \r\nis evaluated. The state of the organism, under the influence of a particular \r\nacceptor of action, is called a functional system, including all \r\nthe components of the organism that participate most directly in realizing \r\nthe intended adaptive action. The \r\nactions of nerves can be considered anabolic, because during a stressful \r\nsituation in which the catabolic hormones of adaption, e.g., cortisol, \r\nincrease, the tissues of the functional system are protected, and while \r\nidle tissues may undergo autophagy or other form of involution, the \r\nneeds of the active tissues are supplied with nutrients from their breakdown, \r\nallowing them to change and, when necessary, grow in size or complexity. The \r\nbrain's role in protecting against injury by stress, when it sees a \r\ncourse of action, has a parallel in the differences between concentric \r\n(positive, muscle shortening) and eccentric (negative, lengthening under \r\ntension) exercise, and also with the differences between innervated \r\nand denervated muscles.  In eccentric exercise and denervation, \r\nless oxygen is used and less carbon dioxide is produced, while lactic \r\nacid increases, displacing carbon dioxide, and more fat is oxidized. \r\nProlonged stress similarly decreases carbon dioxide and increases lactate, \r\nwhile increasing the use of fat. Darkness \r\nis stressful and catabolic. For example, in aging people, the morning \r\nurine contains nearly all of the calcium lost during the 24 hour period, \r\nand mitochondria are especially sensitive to the destructive effects \r\nof darkness. Sleep reduces the destructive catabolic effects of darkness. \r\nDuring the rapid-eye-movement (dreaming) phase of sleep, breathing is \r\ninhibited, and the level of carbon dioxide in the tissues accumulates. \r\nIn restful sleep, the oxygen tension is frequently low enough, and the \r\ncarbon dioxide tension high enough, to trigger the multiplication of \r\nstem cells and mitochondria. Dreams \r\nrepresent the acceptor of action operating independently of the \r\nsensory information that it normally interacts with. During dreams, \r\nthe brain (using a system called the Ascending Reticular Activating \r\nSystem) disconnects itself from the sensory systems. I think this is \r\nthe nervous equivalent of concentric/positive muscle activity, in the \r\nsense that the brain is in control of its actions. The active, dreaming \r\nphase of sleep occurs more frequently in the later part of the night, \r\nas morning approaches. This is the more stressful part of the night, \r\nwith cortisol and some other stress hormones reaching a peak at dawn, \r\nso it would be reasonable for the brain's defensive processes to be \r\nmost active at that time. The dreaming process in the brain is associated \r\nwith deep muscle relaxation, which is probably associated with the trophic \r\n(restorative) actions of the nerves. In \r\nancient China the Taoists were concerned with longevity, and according \r\nto Joseph Needham (Science and Civilization in China) their methods \r\nincluded the use of herbs, minerals, and steroids extracted from the \r\nurine of children. Some of those who claimed extreme longevity practiced \r\ncontrolled breathing and tai chi (involving imagery, movement, and breating), \r\ntypically in the early morning hours, when stress reduction is most \r\nimportant. As far as I know, there are no studies of carbon dioxide \r\nlevels in practitioners of tai chi, but the sensation of warmth they \r\ntypically report suggests that it involves hypoventilation. In \r\nthe 1960s, a Russian researcher examined hospital records of measurements \r\nof newborn babies, and found that for several decades the size of their \r\nheads had been increasing. He suggested that it might be the result \r\nof increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. The \r\nexperiences and nutrition of a pregnant animal are known to affect the \r\nexpression of genes in the offspring, affecting such things as allergies, \r\nmetabolic rate, brain size, and intelligence. Miles Storfer (1999) has \r\nreviewed the evidence for epigenetic environmental control of brain \r\nsize and intelligence. The main mechanisms of epigenetic effects or \r\nimprinting are now known to involve methylation and acetylation \r\nof the chromosomes (DNA and histones). Certain \r\nkinds of behavior, as well as nutrition and other environmental factors, \r\nincrease the production and retention of carbon dioxide. The normal \r\nintrauterine level of carbon dioxide is high, and it can be increased \r\nor decreased by changes in the mother's physiology. The effects of carbon \r\ndioxide on many biological processes involving methylation and acetylation \r\nof the genetic material suggest that the concentration of carbon dioxide \r\nduring gestation might regulate the degree to which parental imprinting \r\nwill persist in the developing fetus. There is some evidence of increased \r\ndemethylation associated with the low level of oxygen in the uterus \r\n(Wellman, et al., 2008). A high metabolic rate and production of carbon \r\ndioxide would increase the adaptability of the new organism, by decreasing \r\nthe limiting genetic imprints. A \r\nquick reduction of carbon dioxide caused by hyperventilation can provoke \r\nan epileptic seizure, and can increase muscle spasms and vascular leakiness, \r\nand (by releasing serotonin and histamine) contribute to inflammation \r\nand clotting disorders. On a slightly longer time scale, a reduction \r\nof carbon dioxide can increase the production of lactic acid, which \r\nis a promoter of inflammation and fibrosis. A prolonged decrease in \r\ncarbon dioxide can increase the susceptibility of proteins to glycation \r\n(the addition of aldehydes, from polyunsaturated fat peroxidation or \r\nmethylglyoxal from lactate metabolism, to amino groups), and a similar \r\nprocess is likely to contribute to the methylation of histones, a process \r\nthat increases with aging. Histones regulate genetic activity. With \r\naging, DNA methylation is increased (Bork, et al., 2009).I suggest \r\nthat methylation stabilizes and protects cells when growth and regeneration \r\naren't possible (and that it's likely to increase when CO2 isn't available).Hibernation (Morin and Storey, 2009) and sporulation (Ruiz-Herrera, \r\n1994; Clancy, et al., 2002) appear to use methylation protectively. Parental \r\nstress, prenatal stress, early life stress, and even stress in adulthood \r\ncontribute to imprinting of the genes, partly through methylation \r\nof DNA and the histones. Methionine \r\nand choline are the main dietary sources of methyl donors. Restriction \r\nof methionine has many protective effects, including increased average \r\n(42%) and maximum (44%) longevity in rats (Richie, et al., 1994). Restriction \r\nof methyl donors causes demethylation of DNA (Epner, 2001).The age accelerating effect of methionine might be related to disturbing \r\nthe methylation balance, inappropriately suppressing cellular activity. \r\nBesides its effect on the methyl pool, methionine inhibits thyroid function \r\nand damages mitochondria. The \r\nlocal concentration of carbon dioxide in specific tissues and organs \r\ncan be adjusted by nervous and hormonal activation or inhibition of \r\nthe carbonic anhydrase enzymes, that accelerate the oonversion of CO2 \r\nto carbonic acid, H2CO3. The activity of carbonic anhydrase can determine \r\nthe density and strength of the skeleton, the excitability of nerves, \r\nthe accumulation of water, and can regulate the structure and function \r\nof the tissues and organs. Ordinarily, \r\ncarbon dioxide and bicarbonate are thought of only in relation to the \r\nregulation of pH, and only in a very general way. Because of the importance \r\nof keeping the pH of the blood within a narrow range, carbon dioxide \r\nis commonly thought of as a toxin, because an excess can cause unconsciousness \r\nand acidosis. But increasing carbon dioxide doesn't necessarily cause \r\nacidosis, and acidosis caused by carbon dioxide isn't as harmful as \r\nlactic acidosis. Frogs \r\nand toads, being amphibians, are especially dependent on water, and \r\nin deserts or areas with a dry season they can survive a prolonged dry \r\nperiod by burrowing into mud or sand. Since they may be buried 10 or \r\n11 inches below the surface, they are rarely found, and so haven't been \r\nextensively studied. In species that live in the California desert, \r\nthey have been known to survive 5 years of burial without rainfall, \r\ndespite a moderately warm average temperature of their surroundings. \r\nOne of their known adaptations is to produce a high level of urea, allowing \r\nthem to osmotically absorb and retain water. (Very old people sometimes \r\nhave extremely high urea and osmotic tension.) Some \r\nlaboratory studies show that as a toad burrows into mud, the amount \r\nof carbon dioxide in its tissues increases. Their skin normally functions \r\nlike a lung, exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide. If the toad's nostrils \r\nare at the surface of the mud, as dormancy begins its breathing will \r\ngradually slow, increasing the carbon dioxide even more. Despite the \r\nincreasing carbon dioxide, the pH is kept stable by an increase of bicarbonate \r\n(Boutilier, et al., 1979). A similar increase of bicarbonate has been \r\nobserved in hibernating hamsters and doormice. Thinking \r\nabout the long dormancy of frogs reminded me of a newspaper story I \r\nread in the 1950s. Workers breaking up an old concrete structure found \r\na dormant toad enclosed in the concrete, and it revived soon after being \r\nreleased. The concrete had been poured decades earlier. Although \r\nsystematic study of frogs or toads during their natural buried estivation \r\nhas been very limited, there have been many reports of accidental discoveries \r\nthat suggest that the dormant state might be extended indefinitely if \r\nconditions are favorable. Carbon dioxide has antioxidant effects, and \r\nmany other stabilizing actions, including protection against hypoxia \r\nand the excitatory effects of intracellular calcium and inflammation \r\n(Baev, et al., 1978, 1995; Bari, et al., 1996; Brzecka, 2007; Kogan, \r\net al., 1994; Malyshev, et al., 1995). When \r\nmitochondria are uncoupled, they produce more carbon dioxide than \r\nnormal, and the mitochondria produce fewer free radicals. Animals with \r\nuncoupled mitochondria live longer than animals with the ordinary, more \r\nefficient mitochondria, that produce more reactive oxidative fragments. \r\nOne effect of the high rate of oxidation of the uncoupled mitochondria \r\nis that they can eliminate polyunsatured fatty acids that might otherwise \r\nbe integrated into tissue structures, or function as inappropriate regulatory \r\nsignals. Birds \r\nhave a higher metabolic rate than mammals of the same size, and live \r\nlonger. Their tissues contain fewer of the highly unsaturated fatty \r\nacids. Queen bees, which live many times longer than worker bees, have \r\nmainly monounsaturated fats in their tissues, while the tissues of the \r\nshort-lived worker bees, receiving a different diet, within a couple \r\nof weeks of hatching will contain highly unsaturated fats. Bats \r\nhave a very high metabolic rate, and an extremely long lifespan for \r\nan animal of their size. While most animals of their small size live \r\nonly a few years, many bats live a few decades. Bat caves usually have \r\nslightly more carbon dioxide than the outside atmosphere, but they usually \r\ncontain a large amount of ammonia, and bats maintain a high serum level \r\nof carbon dioxide, which protects them from the otherwise toxic effects \r\nof the ammonia. The naked mole rat, another small animal with an extremely long lifespan \r\n(in captivity they have lived up to 30 years, 9 or 10 times longer than \r\nmice of the same size) has a low basal metabolic rate, but I think measurements \r\nmade in laboratories might not represent their metabolic rate in their \r\nnatural habitat. They live in burrows that are kept closed, so the percentage \r\nof oxygen is lower than in the outside air, and the percentage of carbon \r\ndioxide ranges from 0.2% to 5% (atmospheric CO2 is about 0.038). The \r\ntemperature and humidity in their burrows can be extremely high, and \r\nto be very meaningful their metabolic rate would have to be measured \r\nwhen their body temperature is raised by the heat in the burrow. When \r\nthey have been studied in Europe and the US, there has been no investigation \r\nof the effect of altitude on their metabolism, and these animals are \r\nnative to the high plains of Kenya and Ethiopia, where the low atmospheric \r\npressure would be likely to increase the level of carbon dioxide in \r\ntheir tissues. Consequently, I doubt that the longevity seen in laboratory \r\nsituations accurately reflects the longevity of the animals in their \r\nnormal habitat. Besides \r\nliving in a closed space with a high carbon dioxide content, mole rats \r\nhave another similarity to bees. In each colony, there is only one female \r\nthat reproduces, the queen, and, like a queen bee, she is the largest \r\nindividual in the colony. In beehives, the workers carefully regulate \r\nthe carbon dioxide concentration, which varies from about 0.2% to 6%, \r\nsimilar to that of the mole rat colony. A high carbon dioxide content \r\nactivates the ovaries of a queen bee, increasing her fertility. Since \r\nqueen bees and mole rats live in the dark, I think their high carbon \r\ndioxide compensates for the lack of light. (Both light and CO2 help \r\nto maintain oxidative metabolism and inhibit lactic acid formation.) \r\nMole rats are believed to sleep very little. During the night, normal \r\npeople tolerate more CO2, and so breathe less, especially near morning, \r\nwith increased active dreaming sleep. A mole rat has never been known to develop cancer. Their serum C-reactive \r\nprotein is extremely low, indicating that they are resistant to inflammation. \r\nIn humans and other animals that are susceptible to cancer, one of the \r\ngenes that is likely to be silenced by stress, aging, and methylation \r\nis p53, a tumor-suppressor gene. If \r\nthe intrauterine experience, with low oxygen and high carbon dioxide, \r\nserves to reprogram cells to remove the accumulated effects of \r\nage and stress, and so to maximize the developmental potential of the \r\nnew organism, a life that's lived with nearly those levels of oxygen \r\nand carbon dioxide might be able to avoid the progressive silencing \r\nof genes and loss of function that cause aging and degenerative diseases. Several \r\ndiseases and syndromes are now thought to involve abnormal methylation \r\nof genes. Prader-Willi sydrome, Angelman's syndrome, and various autistic \r\nspectrum disorders, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and \r\nseveral kinds of cancer seem to involve excess methylation. Moderate \r\nmethionine restriction (for example, using gelatin regularly in the \r\ndiet) might be practical, but if increased carbon dioxide can activate \r\nthe demethylase enzymes in a controlled way, it might be a useful treatment \r\nfor the degenerative diseases and for aging itself. The \r\nlow carbon dioxide production of hypothyroidism (e.g., Lee and Levine, \r\n1999), and the respiratory alkalosis of estrogen excess, are often overlooked. \r\nAn adequate supply of calcium, and sometimes supplementation of salt \r\nand baking soda, can increase the tissue content of CO2.

Overall, they display increased sensitivity \r\nto anesthetics, higher incidence of perioperative cardiovascular morbidity, \r\nincreased risks for postoperative ventilatory failure and other physiological \r\nderangements. The previously described physiological basis for the increased \r\nincidence of postoperative ventilatory failure in hypothyroid patients \r\nincludes decreased central and peripheral ventilatory responses to hypercarbia \r\nand hypoxia, muscle weakness, depressed central respiratory drive, and \r\nresultant alveolar hypoventilation. These ventilatory failures are associated \r\nmost frequently with severe hypoxia and carbon dioxide (CO2) retention. \r\nThe purpose of this clinical report is to discuss an interesting and \r\nunique anesthetic presentation of a patient with severe hypothyroidism. \r\nCLINICAL FEATURES: We describe an unique presentation of ventilatory \r\nfailure in a 58 yr old man with severe hypothyroidism. He had exceedingly \r\nlow perioperative respiratory rate (3-4 bpm) and minute ventilation \r\nvolume, and at the same time developed primary acute respiratory alkalosis \r\nand associated hypocarbia (P(ET)CO2 approximately 320-22 mmHg). CONCLUSION: \r\nOur patient's ventilatory failure was based on unacceptably low minute \r\nventilation and respiratory rate that was unable to sustain adequate \r\noxygenation. His profoundly lowered basal metabolic rate and decreased \r\nCO2 production, resulting probably from severe hypothyroidism, may have \r\nresulted in development of acute respiratory alkalosis in spite of concurrently \r\ndiminished minute ventilation.

The orchestrated \r\nexpression of genes is essential for the development and survival of \r\nevery organism. In addition to the role of transcription factors, the \r\navailability of genes for transcription is controlled by a series of \r\nproteins that regulate epigenetic chromatin remodeling. The two most \r\nstudied epigenetic phenomena are DNA methylation and histone-tail modifications. \r\nAlthough a large body of literature implicates the deregulation of histone \r\nacetylation and DNA methylation with the pathogenesis of cancer, recently \r\nepigenetic mechanisms have also gained much attention in the neuroscientific \r\ncommunity. In fact, a new field of research is rapidly emerging and \r\nthere is now accumulating evidence that the molecular machinery that \r\nregulates histone acetylation and DNA methylation is intimately involved \r\nin synaptic plasticity and is essential for learning and memory. Importantly, \r\ndysfunction of epigenetic gene expression in the brain might be involved \r\nin neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. In particular, it was \r\nfound that inhibition of histone deacetylases attenuates synaptic and \r\nneuronal loss in animal models for various neurodegenerative diseases \r\nand improves cognitive function. In this article, we will summarize \r\nrecent data in the novel field of neuroepigenetics and discuss the question \r\nwhy epigenetic strategies are suitable therapeutic approaches for the \r\ntreatment of brain diseases.

        "chunk_html": "RU486, Cancer, Estrogen, and Progesterone.Recently \nmany people have been disturbed by reading claims that progesterone \ncan cause cancer, or diabetes, or autoimmune diseases, or heart disease, \nor Alzheimer's disease. A flurry of press conferences, and a few groups \nof \"molecular biologists\" working on \"progesterone receptors,\" \n\nand the results of studies in which Prempro (containing a synthetic \n\"progestin\") increased breast cancer, have created great confusion \nand concern, at least in the English speaking countries. Wyeth, \nthe manufacturer of Prempro, has been highly motivated to recover their \nsales and profits that declined about 70% in the first two years after \nthe Women's Health Initiative announced its results. When billions of \ndollars in profits are involved, clever public relations can achieve \nmarvelous things. Women \nand other mammals that aredeficientin progesterone, \nand/or that have an excess of estrogen, have a higher than average incidence \nof cancer. Animal experiments have shown that administering progesterone \ncould prevent cancer. Cells in the most cancer-susceptible tissues proliferate \nin proportion to the ratio of estrogen to progesterone. When the estrogen \ndominance persists for a long time without interruption, there are progressive \ndistortions in the structure of the responsive organs--the uterus, breast, \npituitary, lung, liver, kidney, brain, and other organs--and those structural \ndistortions tend to progress gradually from fibroses to cancer. As \na result of the early studies in both humans and animals, progesterone \nwas used by many physicians to treat the types of cancer that were clearly \ncaused by estrogen, especially uterine, breast, and kidney cancers. \nBut by the 1950s, the drug industry had created the myth that their \npatented synthetic analogs of progesterone were medically more effective \nthan progesterone itself, and the result has been that medroxyprogesterone \nacetate and other synthetics have been widely used to treat women's \ncancers, including breast cancer. Unfortunately, \nthose synthetic compounds have a variety of functions unlike progesterone, \nincluding some estrogenic and/or androgenic and/or glucocorticoid and/or \nantiprogesterone functions, besides other special, idiosyncratic side \neffects. The rationale for their use was that they were \"like progesterone, \nonly better.\" The unpleasant and unwanted truth is that, as a group, \nthey are seriously carcinogenic, besides being toxic in a variety of \nother ways. Thousands of researchers have drawn conclusions about the \neffects of progesterone on the basis of their experiments with a synthetic \nprogestin. The \nearliest studies of estrogen and progesterone in the 1930s had the great \nadvantage of a scientific culture that was relatively unpolluted by \nthe pharmaceutical industry. As described by Carla Rothenberg, the massive \nmanipulation of the medical, regulatory, and scientific culture by the \nestrogen industry began in 1941. After that, the role of metaphysics, \nword magic, and epicycle-like models increasingly replaced empirical \nscience in endocrinology and cell physiology. As \nthe estrogen industry began losing billions of dollars a year following \nthe 2002 report from the Women's Health Initiative regarding estrogen's \ntoxicity, and as it was noticed that progesterone sales had increased \nmore than 100-fold, it was clear what had to be done--the toxic effects \nof estrogen had to be transferred to progesterone. For more than 50 \nyears, progesterone was recognized to be antimitotic and anti-inflammatory \nand anticarcinogenic, but suddenly it has become a mitogenic pro-inflammatory \ncarcinogen. Science \nused to involve confirmation or refutation of published results and \nconclusions. A different experimenter, using the technique described \nin a publication, would often get a different result, and a dialog or \ndisputation would develop, sometimes continuing for years, before consensus \nwas achieved, though many times there would be no clear conclusion or \nconsensus. In \nthat traditional scientific environment, it was customary to recognize \nthat a certain position remained hypothetical and controversial until \nsome new technique or insight settled the question with some degree \nof clarity and decisiveness. People who cherry-picked studies to support \ntheir position, while ignoring contradictory evidence, were violating \nthe basic scientific principles of tentativeness and reasonableness. \nContradictory, as well as confirmatory, data have to be considered. But \nwhen a single experiment involves several people working for a year \nor more, at a cost of a million or more dollars, who is going to finance \nan experiment that \"would merely confirm\" those results? The \nnewly developed techniques for identifying specific molecules are often \nvery elaborate and expensive, and as a result only a few kinds of molecule \nare usually investigated in each experiment. The results are open to \nvarious interpretations, and most of those interpretations depend on \nresults from other studies, whose techniques, results, and conclusions \nhave never been challenged, either. There is no significant source of \nfunding to challenge the programs of the pharmaceutical industry. The \nresult is that the pronouncements of the principal investigator, and \nthe repetitions of those conclusions in the mass media, create a culture \nof opinion, without the foundation of multiple confirmations that used \nto be part of the scientific process. The process has taken on many \nof the features of a cult, in which received opinions are repeatedly \nreinforced by the investment of money and authority. Newspaper reporters \nknow that the team of investigators spent two years on their project, \nand the lead investigator wears a white lab coat during the interview, \nso the reporters don't notice that the investigators' conclusion is \na non sequitur, supported by chains of non sequiturs. The \npublic gets most of its information about science from the mass media, \nand the increasingly concentrated ownership of the media contributes \nto the use of scientific news as an adjunct to their main business, \nadvertising and product promotion. The pharmaceutical industry spends \nbillions of dollars annually on direct-to-consumer advertising, so the \nbig scientific news, for the media, is likely to be anything that will \nincrease their advertising revenue. Social-economic \ncults often simplify the thought processes required by the participants, \nby inventing a scapegoat. The estrogen cult has decided that progesterone \nwill be its scapegoat. Hans \nSelye argued that steroid hormones should be named by their origin, \nor by their chemical structural names, rather than their effects, because \neach hormone has innumerable effects. To name a substance according \nto its effects is to predict and to foreordain the discoveries that \nwill be made regarding its effects. The \ncommon system of hormonal names according to their putative effects \nhas allowed ideology and metaphysical ideas to dominate endocrinology. \nThe worst example of metaphysical medicine was the use, for more than \n50 years, of \"estrogen, the female hormone\" to treat prostate \ncancer, in the belief that \"male hormones\" cause the cancer, \nand that the female hormone would negate it. This word magic led to \na vast psychotic medical endeavor, that has only recently been reconsidered. Within \nthe scheme of hormones understood according to their names, \"hormone \nreceptors\" were proposed to be the mechanism by which hormones \nproduced their effects. Each hormone had a receptor. If another substance \nbound more strongly than the hormone to its receptor, without producing \nthe effects of the hormone, it was called an antihormone. The \nindustry of synthetic hormones used the ideology of unitary hormonal \naction to identify new substances as pharmaceutical hormones, that were \nalways in some way said to be better than the natural hormones--for \nexample by being \"orally active,\" unlike natural hormones, \nsupposedly. Physicians docilely went along with whatever the drug salesmen \ntold them. If a drug was classified as a \"progestin\" by a \nsingle reaction in one animal tissue, then it had a metaphysical identity \nwith the natural hormone, except that it was better, and patentable. The \nnatural hormones eventually were assigned any of the toxic properties \nthat were observed for the pharmaceutical products \"in their class.\" \nIf synthetic progestins caused heart disease, birth defects, and cancer, \nthen the \"natural progestin\" was assumed to do that, too. \nIt's important to realize the impact of logical fallacies on the medical \nculture. Like \nthe hormones themselves, which metaphysically supposedly acted upon \none receptor, to activate one gene (or set of genes), the antihormones \ncame to be stereotyped. If a particular hormonal action was blocked \nby a chemical, then that substance became an antagonistic antihormone, \nand when its administration produced an effect, that effect was taken \nto be the result of blocking the hormone for which it was \"the \nantagonist.\" The \n\"antiprogesterone\" molecule, RU486, besides having some progesterone-like \nand antiestrogenic properties, also has (according to Hackenberg, et \nal., 1996).  some androgenic, antiandrogenic, and antiglucocorticoid \nproperties. Experiments in which it is used might have pharmaceutical \nmeaning, but they so far have very little clear biological meaning. Adding \nto the conceptual sloppiness of the \"molecular biology\" wing \nof endocrinology, the culture in which pharmaceutical products had come \nto dominate medical ideas about hormones allowed the conventional pharmaceutical \nvehicles to be disregarded in most experiments, bothin vitroandin vivo. If progesterone was injected into patients mixed \nwith sesame oil and benzyl alcohol, then it often didn't occur to animal \nexperimenters to give control injections of the solvent. Forin vitrostudies, in a watery medium, oil wouldn't do, so they would use an alcohol \nsolvent, and again often forgot to do a solvent control experiment. The \nimportance of the solvent was seen by an experimenter studying the effect \nof vitamin E on age pigment in nerves. It occurred to that experimenter \nto test the ethyl alcohol alone, and he found that it produced almost \nthe same effect as that produced by the solution of alcohol and vitamin \nE. Workers with hormones often just assume that a little alcohol wouldn't \naffect their system. But when the effects of alcohol by itself have \nbeen studied, many of the effects produced by very low concentrations \nhappen to be the same effects that have been ascribed to hormones, such \nas progesterone. In \nsome cases, the solvent allows the hormone to crystallize, especially \nif the solvent is water-miscible, and fails to distribute it evenly \nthrough the medium and cells as the experimenter assumed would happen, \nand so the experimenter reports that the hormone is not effective in \nthat kind of cell, even though the hormone didn't reach the cells in \nthe amount intended. These \nare four of the common sources of error about progesterone: (1) Saying \nthat progesterone has produced an effect which was produced by a different \nsubstance. (2) Saying that progesterone is the cause of a certain effect, \nif an \"anti-progesterone\" chemical prevents that effect. (3) \nSaying that progesterone caused something, when in fact the solvent \ncaused it. And (4) saying that progesterone fails to do something, when \nprogesterone hasn't been delivered to the system being studied. Many \nyears ago, experimenters who wanted to minimize the problems involved \nin administering progesterone in toxic solvents found that, with careful \neffort, progesterone could be transferred to a protein, such as albumin, \nand that the albumin-progesterone complex could be washed to remove \nthe solvent. In this form, the progesterone can be delivered to cells \nin a form that isn't radically different from the form in which it naturally \ncirculates in the body. Apparently, the labor involved discourages the \nwidespread use of this technique. Although \nthe industry's early generalizations about estrogen and progesterone, \ndefining them as \"the female hormone\" and \"the pregnancy \nhormone,\" were radically mistaken, some useful generalizations \nabout their effects were gradually being built up during the first few \ndecades in which their chemical and physiological properties were studied. Estrogen's \nname, derived from the gadfly, accurately suggests its role as an excitant, \ngetting things started. Progesterone's name, relating to pregnancy, \nis compatible with thinking of it as an agent of calming and fulfillment. \nBut these properties show up in every aspect of physiology, and the \nspecial cases of female estrus and pregnancy can be properly understood \nonly in the larger context, in which, for example, progesterone is a \nbrain hormone in both sexes and at all ages, and estrogen is an essential \nmale hormone involved in the sperm cell's function and male libido. Progesterone \ncan, without estrogen, create the uterine conditions for implantation \nof an embryo (Piccini, 2005, progesterone induces LIF; Sherwin, et al., \n2004, LIF can substitute for estrogen), and it has many other features \nthat can be considered apart from estrogen, such as its regulation of \nsalts, energy metabolism, protein metabolism, immunity, stress, and \ninflammation, but without understanding its opposition to estrogen, \nthere will be no coherent understanding of progesterone's biological \nmeaning. Both \nestrogen and progesterone are hydrophobic molecules (progesterone much \nmore so than estrogen) which bind with some affinity to many components \nof cells. Certain proteins that strongly bind the hormones are called \ntheir receptors. Cells \nrespond to stimulation by estrogen by producing a variety of molecules, \nincluding the \"progesterone receptor\" protein. When progesterone \nenters the cell, binding to these proteins, the estrogenic stimulation \nis halted, by a series of reactions in which the estrogen receptors \ndisintegrate, and in which estrogen is made water soluble by the activation \nof enzymes that attach sulfate or a sugar acid, causing it leave the \ncell and move into the bloodstream, and by reactions that prevent its \nreentry into the cell by inactivating another type of enzyme, and that \nsuppress itsde novoformation in the cell, and that oxidize \nit into a less active form. Progesterone terminates estrogen's cellular \nfunctions with extreme thoroughness. A \nrecent publication inScience(\"Prevention of Brca1-mediated mammary tumorigenesis in mice by \na progesterone antagonist,\" Poole, et al., Dec. 1, 2006), with \nassociated press conferences, reported an experiment in which a special \nkind of mouse was prepared, which lacked two tumor-suppressing genes \ncalled BRCA and p53. One \nof the functions of the BRCA gene product is to repair genetic damage, \nand another function is to (like progesterone) suppress the estrogen \nreceptor and its functions. Estrogen, and some environmental carcinogens, \ncan suppress the BRCA gene product. Estrogen can also turn off the tumor \nsuppressor protein, p53. So it is interesting that a group of experimenters \nchose to produce a mouse that lacked both the normal BRCA and p53 genes. \nThey had a mouse that was designed to unleash estrogen's effects, and \nthat modeled some of the features of estrogen toxicity and progesterone \ndeficiency. This \nmouse, lacking an essential gene that would allow progesterone to function \nnormally, probably affecting progesterone's ability to eliminate the \nestrogen receptor, also lacked the tumor suppressor gene p53, which \nis required for luteinization (Cherian-Shaw 2004);in its absence, \nprogesterone synthesis is decreased,estrogen synthesis is increased. (Chen, \nY, et al., 1999:BRCA represses the actions of estrogen and its \nreceptor, and, like progesterone, activates the p21 promoter, which \ninhibits cell proliferation. Aspirin and vitamin D also act through \np21.) The \nmutant BRCA gene prevents the cell, even in the presence of progesterone, \nfrom turning off estrogen's effects the way it should. The antiestrogenic \nRU486 (some articles below), which has some of progesterone's effects \n(including therapeutic actions against endometrial and breast cancer), \nappears to overcome some of the effects of that mutation. It \nmight have been proper to describe the engineered mouse that lacked \nboth the BRCA and the p53 genes as a mouse in which the effects of estrogen \nexcess and progesterone deficiency would be especially pronounced and \ndeadly. To speak of progesterone as contributing to the development \nof cancer in that specially designed mouse goes far beyond bad science. \nHowever, that study makes sense if it is seen as preparation for the \npromotion of a new drug similar in effect to RU486, to prevent breast \ncancer. The \nstudy's lead author, Eva Lee, quoted by a university publicist, said \n\n\"We found that progesterone plays a role in the development of \nbreast cancer by encouraging the proliferation of mammary cells that \ncarry a breast cancer gene.\" But they didn't measure the amount \nof progesterone present in the animals. They didn't \"find\" \nanything at all about progesterone. The \"anti-progesterone\" \ndrug they used has been used for many years to treat uterine, ovarian, \nand breast cancers, in some caseswithprogesterone, to intensify \nits effects, and its protective effects are very likely the result of \nits antiestrogenic and anti-cortisol effects, both of which are well \nestablished, and relevant. In some cases, it acts like progesterone, \nonly more strongly. \"Other \nmore specific progesterone blockers are under development,\" Lee \nnotes. And the article inSciencemagazine looks like nothing \nmore than the first advertisement for one that her husband, Wen-Hwa \nLee, has designed. According \nto publicists at the University of California, Irvine, \"Lee plans \nto focus his research on developing new compounds that will disrupt \nend-stage cancer cells. The goal is a small molecule that, when injected \ninto the blood stream, will act as something of a biological cruise \nmissile to target, shock and awe the cancerous cells.\" \"In \nthis research, he will make valuable use of a breast cancer model developed \nby his wife.\" \"She developed the model, and I will develop \nthe molecule,\" Lee says. \"We can use this model to test a \nnew drug and how it works in combination with old drugs.\" \"Previously \nwe blamed everything,\" Lee says of his eye cancer discovery. \"We \nblamed electricity, we blamed too much sausage - but in this case it's \nclear: It's the gene's fault.\" The \nthings that these people know, demonstrated by previous publications, \nbut that they don't say in theSciencearticle, are very revealing. \nThe retinoblastoma gene (and its protein product), a specialty of Wen-Hwa \nLee, is widely known to be a factor in breast cancer, and to be responsive \nto progesterone, RU486, and p21. Its links to ubiquitin, the hormone \nreceptors, proteasomes, and the BRCA gene are well known, but previously \nthey were seen as linking estrogen to cell proliferation, and progesterone \nto the inhibition of cellular proliferation. By \norganizing their claims around the idea that RU486 is acting as an antiprogesterone, \nrather than as a progesterone synergist in opposing estrogen, Eva Lee's \nteam has misused words to argue that it is progesterone, rather than \nestrogen, that causes breast cancer. Of the many relevant issues that \ntheir publication ignores, the absence of measurements of the actual \nestrogen and progesterone in the animals' serum most strongly suggests \nthat the project was not designed for proper scientific purposes. They \nchose to use techniques that are perfectly inappropriate for showing \nwhat they claim to show. In \nthe second paragraph of their article, Poole, et al., say \"Hormone \nreplacement therapy with progesterone and estrogen, but not estrogen \nalone, has been associated with an elevation risk in postmenopausal \nwomen.\" Aside from the gross inaccuracy of saying \"progesterone,\" \n\nrather than synthetic progestin, they phrase their comment about \"estrogen \nalone\" in a way that suggests an identity of purpose with the estrogen \nindustry apologists, who have been manipulating the data from the WHI \nestrogen-only study, clearly to lay the blame on progesterone. (Women \nwho took estrogen had many more surgeries to remove mammographically \nabnormal breast tissue. This would easily account for fewer minor cancer \ndiagnoses; despite this, there were more advanced cancers in the estrogen \ngroup.) While \nthe Poole, et al., group are operating within a context of new views \nregarding estrogen, progesterone, and cancer, they are ignoring the \ngreater part of contemporary thinking about cancer, a consensus that \nhas been growing for over 70 years:All of the factors that produce \ncancer, including breast cancer, produce inflammation and cellular excitation. Progesterone \nis antiinflammatory, and reduces cellular excitation. Even \nwithin their small world of molecular endocrinology, thinking in ways \nthat have been fostered by computer technology, about gene networks, \ninteracting nodes, and crosstalk between pathways, their model and their \narguments don't work. They have left out the complexity that could give \ntheir argument some weight. The \nmedical mainstream has recognized for 30 years that progesterone protects \nthe uterus against cancer; that was the reason for adding Provera to \nthe standard menopausal hormonal treatment. The new claim that natural \nprogesterone causes breast cancer should oblige them to explain why \nthe hormone would have opposite effects in different organs, but the \nmechanisms of action of estrogen and progesterone are remarkably similar \nin both organs, even when examined at the molecular level. If \"molecular \nendocrinologists\" are going to have interpretations diametrically \nopposed to classical endocrinology (if black is to be white, if apples \nare to fall up), they will have to produce some very interesting evidence. Cancer \nis a malignant (destructive, invasive) tumor that kills the organism. \nThe main dogma regarding its nature and origin is that it differs genetically \nfrom the host, as a result of mutations. Estrogen causes mutations and \nother forms of genetic instability, as well as cancer itself. Progesterone \ndoesn't harm genes or cause genetic instability. The \nspeculative anti-progesterone school has put great emphasis on the issue \nof cellular proliferation, with the reasoning that proliferating cells \nare more likely to undergo genetic changes. And synthetic progestins \noften do imitate estrogen and increase cellular proliferation. People \nlike the Lees are asserting as an established fact that progesterone \nincreases cellular proliferation. A \npaper by Soderqvist has been cited as proof that progesterone increases \nthe proliferation of breast cells. He saw more mitoses in the breasts \nduring the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and said the slightly \nincreased mitotic rate was \"associated with\" progesterone. \nOf course, estrogen increased at the same time, and estrogen causes \nsustained proliferation of breast cells, while progesterone stimulation \ncauses only two cell divisions, ending with the differentiation of the \ncell. (Groshong, et al., 1997, Owen, et al., 1998) One \nof the ways that progesterone stops proliferation and promotes differentiation \nis by keeping the retinoblastoma protein in its unphosphorylated, active \nprotective state (Gizard, et al., 2006) The effects of estrogen and \nprogesterone on that protein are reciprocal (Chen, et al., 2005). It's \nhard for me to imagine that the Lees don't know about these hormonal \neffects on Wen-Hwa's retinoblastoma gene product. The \ninactivation of that protein by hyperphosphorylation is part of a general \nbiological process, in which activation of a cell (by injury or nervous \nor hormonal or other stimulation, including radiation) leads to the \nactivation of a large group of about 500 enzymes, phosphorylases, which \namplify the stimulation, and cause the cell to respond by becoming active \nin many ways, for example, by stopping the synthesis of glycogen, and \nbeginning its conversion to glucose to provide energy for the adaptive \nresponses, that include the activation of genes and the synthesis or \ndestruction of proteins. Another set of enzymes, the phosphatases, remove \nthe activating phosphate groups, and allow the cell to return to its \nresting state. The \n\"molecular\" endocrinologists and geneticists are committed \nto a reductionist view of life, the view that DNA is the essence, the \nsecret, of life, and that it controls cells through its interactions \nwith smaller molecules, such as the hormone receptors. The \nidea of hormone receptors can be traced directly to the work of Elwood \nJensen, who started his career working in chemical warfare, at the University \nof Chicago. Jensen claims that an experiment he did in the 1950s \"caused \nthe demise\" of the enzymic-redox theory of estrogen's action, by \nshowing that uterine tissue can't oxidize estradiol, and that its only \naction is on the genes, by way of \"the estrogen receptor.\" \n\nBut the uterus and other tissues do oxidize estradiol, and its cyclic \noxidation and reduction is clearly involved in some of estrogen's toxic \nand excitatory effects. For \nsome reason, the military is still interested in hormone receptors. \nLawrence National Weapons Laboratory (with its giant \"predictive \nscience\" computer) is now the site of some of the anti-progesterone \nresearch. Molecular \nbiologists have outlined a chain of reactions, starting at the cell \nsurface, and cascading through a series of phosphorylations, until the \ngenes are activated. The cell surface is important, because cells are \nalways in contact with something, and their functions and structure \nmust be appropriate for their location. But the reductionist view of \na network of phosphorylating enzymes ignores some facts. Glycogen \nphosphorylase was the first enzyme whose activity was shown to be regulated \nby structural changes, allosterism. The active form is stabilized by \nphosphorylation, but this process takes seconds or minutes to develop, \nand the enzyme becomes active immediately when the cell is stimulated, \nfor example in muscle contraction, within milliseconds. This kind of \nallosteric activation (or inactivation) can be seen in a variety of \nother enzymes, the cold-labile enzymes. A coherent change of the cell \ncauses coordinated changes in its parts. These processes of enzymic \nregulation are fast, and can occur throughout a cell, practically simultaneously. \nStrict reductionists don't like to talk about them. \"Network analysis\" \n\nbecomes irrelevant. While \na cell in general is activated by a wave of phosphorylation, certain \nprocesses (including glycogen synthesis) are blocked. When BRCA1 or \nretinoblastoma protein is hyperphosphorylated, its anti-estrogenic, \nanti-proliferative functions are stopped. The communication between \ncells is another function that's stopped by injury-induced phosphorylation. Estrogen \ngenerally activates phosphorylases, and inactivates phosphatases. Progesterone \ngenerally opposes those effects. Phosphorylation \nis just one of the regulatory systems that are relevant to the development \nof cancer, and that are acted on oppositely by estrogen and progesterone. \nTo reduce the explanation for cancer to a gene or two or three may be \nan attractive idea for molecular endocrinologists, but the idea's simplicity \nis delusive. Each \ncomponent of the cell contributes complexly to the cell's regulatory \nstability. Likewise, a drug such as RU486 complexly modifies the cell's \nstability, changing thresholds in many ways, some of which synergize \nwith progesterone (e.g., supporting the GABA system), others of which \nantagonize progesterone's effects (e.g., increasing exposure to prostaglandins). There \nare other proteins in cells, besides the \"hormone receptors,\" \nthat bind progesterone, and that regulate cell functions globally. The \nsigma receptor, for example, that interacts with cocaine to excite the \ncell, interacts with progesterone to quiet the cell. The sigma receptor \nis closely related functionally to the histones, that regulate the activity \nof chromosomes and DNA, and progesterone regulates many processes that \ncontrol the histones. The \nGABA receptor system, and the systems that respond to glutamic acid \n(e.g., the \"NMDA receptors\") are involved in the inhibitory \nand excitatory processes that restrain or accelerate the growth of cancer \ncells, and progesterone acts through those systems to quiet cells, and \nrestrain growth. The \ninhibitor of differentiation, Id-1, is inhibited by progesterone, activated \nby estrogen (Lin, et al., 2000). Proteins acting in the opposite direction, \nPTEN and p21, for example, are activated by progesterone, and inhibited \nby estrogen. The \ninflammatory cytokines, acting through the NFkappaB protein to activate \ngenes, are generally oppositely regulated by estrogen and progesterone. Prostaglandins, \nplatelet activating factor, nitric oxide, peroxidase, lipases, histamine, \nserotonin, lactate, insulin, intracellular calcium, carbon dioxide, \nosmolarity, pH, and the redox environment are all relevant to cancer, \nand are affected systemically and locally by estrogen and progesterone \nin generally opposing ways. About \nten years ago, Geron corporation announced that it was developing products \nto control aging and cancer, by regulating telomerase, the enzyme that \nlengthens a piece of DNA at the end of the chromosomes. Their argument \nwas that telomeres get shorter each time a cell divides, and that after \nabout 50 divisions, cells reach the limit identified by Leonard Hayflick, \nand die, and that this accounts for the aging of the organism. Cancer \ncells are immortal, they said, because they maintain active telomerase, \nso the company proposed to cure cancer, by selling molecules to inhibit \nthe enzyme, and to cure aging, by providing new enzymes for old people. \nHowever, Hayflick's limit was mainly the effect of bad culture methods, \nand the theory that the shortening of telomeres causes aging was contradicted \nby the finding of longer telomeres in some old people than in some young \npeople, and different telomere lengths in different organs of the same \nperson. But \nit's true that cancer cells have active telomerase, and that most healthy \ncells don't. It happens that telomerase is activated by cellular injury, \nsuch as radiation, that activates phosphorylases, and that it is inactivated \nby phosphatases. Estrogen activates telomerase, and progesterone inhibits \nit. Molecular \nendocrinology is very important to the pharmaceutical industry, because \nit lends itself so well to television commercials and corporate stock \nofferings. Monsanto and the Pentagon believe they can use reductionist \nmolecular biology to predict, manipulate, and control life processes, \nbut so far it is only their ability to damage organisms that has been \ndemonstrated. Besides \nthe early animal studies that showed experimentally that progesterone \ncan prevent or cure a wide variety of tumors, the newer evidence showing \nthat progesterone is a major protective factor against even breast cancer, \nwould suggest that dishonest efforts to protect estrogen sales by preventing \nwomen from using natural progesterone will be causing more women to \ndevelop cancer. The \nrecent report that the incidence of breast cancer in the United States \nfell drastically between 2002 and 2004, following the great decline \nin estrogen sales, shows the magnitude of the injury and death caused \nby the falsifications of the estrogen industry--a matter of millions \nof unnecessary deaths, just in the years that I have been working on \nthe estrogen issue. The current campaign against progesterone can be \nexpected to cause many unnecessary cancer deaths (e.g., Plu-Bureau, \net al., Mauvais-Jarvis, et al.), while distracting the public from the \nculpability of the estrogen industry.

The diuretics were offered for \r\ntreating high blood pressure, pulmonary edema, heart failure, idiopathic \r\nedema, orthostatic edema and obesity, and other forms of water retention, \r\nincluding pregnancy, and since they functioned by causing sodium to \r\nbe excreted in the urine, their sale was accompanied by advising the \r\npatients to reduce their salt intake to make the diuretic more effective.It \r\nwas clear to some physicians (and to most veterinarians) that salt restriction, \r\nespecially combined with salt-losing diuresis, was very harmful during \r\npregnancy, but that combination became standard medical practice for \r\nmany years, damaging millions of babies.Despite \r\nnumerous publications showing that diuretics could cause the edematous \r\nproblems that they were supposed to remedy, they have been one of the \r\nmost profitable types of drug. Dietary salt restriction has become a \r\ncultural cliché, largely as a consequence of the belief that sodium \r\ncauses edema and hypertension.Salt \r\nrestriction, according to a review of about 100 studies (Alderman, 2004), \r\nlowers the blood pressure a few points. But that generally doesnt \r\nrelate to better health. In one study (3000 people, 4 years), there \r\nwas a clear increase in mortality in the individuals who ate less salt. \r\nAn extra few grams of salt per day was associated with a 36% reduction \r\nin coronary events (Alderman, et al., 1995). Another study (more \r\nthan 11,000 people, 22 years) also showed an inverse relation between \r\nsalt intake and mortality (Alderman, et al., 1997).Tom \r\nBrewer, an obstetrician who devoted his career to educating the public \r\nabout the importance of prenatal nutrition, emphasizing adequate protein \r\n(especially milk), calories, and salt, was largely responsible for the \r\ngradual abandonment of the low-salt plus diuretics treatment for pregnant \r\nwomen. He explained that sodium, in association with serum albumin, \r\nis essential for maintaining blood volume. Without adequate sodium, \r\nthe serum albumin is unable to keep water from leaving the blood and \r\nentering the tissues. The tissues swell as the volume of blood is reduced.During \r\npregnancy, the reduced blood volume doesnt adequately nourish and \r\noxygenate the growing fetus, and the reduced circulation to the kidneys \r\ncauses them to release a signal substance (renin) that causes the blood \r\nto circulate faster, under greater pressure. A low salt diet is just \r\none of the things that can reduce kidney circulation and stimulate renin \r\nproduction. Bacterial endotoxin, and other things that cause excessive \r\ncapillary permeability, edema, or shock-like symptoms, will activate \r\nrenin secretion.The \r\nblood volume problem isnt limited to the hypertension of pregnancy \r\ntoxemia: Plasma volume is usually lower in patients with essential \r\nhypertension than in normal subjects (Tarazi, 1976).Several \r\nstudies of preeclampsia or toxemia of pregnancy showed that supplementing \r\nthe diet with salt would lower the womens blood pressure, and prevent \r\nthe other complications associated with toxemia(Shanklin and Hodin, 1979).It \r\nhas been known for many years that decreasing sodium intake causes the \r\nbody to respond adaptively, increasing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \r\nsystem (RAAS). The activation of this system is recognized as a factor \r\nin hypertension, kidney disease, heart failure, fibrosis of the heart, \r\nand other problems. Sodium restriction also increases serotonin, activity \r\nof the sympathetic nervous system, and plasminogen activator inhibitor \r\ntype-1 (PAI-1), which contributes to the accumulation of clots and is \r\nassociated with breast and prostate cancer. The sympathetic nervous \r\nsystem becomes hyperactive in preeclampsia (Metsaars, et al., 2006).Despite \r\nthe general knowledge of the relation of dietary salt to the RAA system, \r\nand its application by Brewer and others to the prevention of pregnancy \r\ntoxemia, it isnt common to see the information applied to other problems, \r\nsuch as aging and the stress-related degenerative diseases.Many \r\nyoung women periodically crave salt and sugar, especially around ovulation \r\nand premenstrually, when estrogen is high. Physiologically, this is \r\nsimilar to the food cravings of pregnancy. Premenstrual water retention \r\nis a common problem, and physicians commonly offer the same advice to \r\ncycling women that was offered as a standard treatment for pregnant \r\nwomen--the avoidance of salt, sometimes with a diuretic. But when women \r\npremenstrually increase their salt intake according to their craving, \r\nthe water retention can be prevented.Blood \r\nvolume changes during the normal menstrual cycle, and when the blood \r\nvolume is low, it is usually because the water has moved into the tissues, \r\ncausing edema. When estrogen is high, the osmolarity of the blood is \r\nlow. (Courtar, et al., 2007; Stachenfeld, et al., 1999). Hypothyroidism \r\n(which increases the ratio of estrogen to progesterone) is a major cause \r\nof excessive sodium loss.The \r\nincrease of adrenalin caused by salt restriction has many harmful effects, \r\nincluding insomnia. Many old people have noticed that a low sodium diet \r\ndisturbs their sleep, and that eating their usual amount of salt restores \r\ntheir ability to sleep. The activity of the sympathetic nervous system \r\nincreases with aging, so salt restriction is exacerbating one of the \r\nbasic problems of aging. Chronically increased activity of the sympathetic \r\n(adrenergic) nervous system contributes to capillary leakage, insulin \r\nresistance (with increased free fatty acids in the blood), and degenerative \r\nchanges in the brain (Griffith and Sutin, 1996).The \r\nflexibility of blood vessels (compliance) is decreased by a low-salt \r\ndiet, and vascular stiffness caused by over-activity of the sympathetic \r\nnervous system is considered to be an important factor in hypertension, \r\nespecially with aging.Pregnancy \r\ntoxemia/preeclampsia involves increased blood pressure and capillary \r\npermeability, and an excess of prolactin. Prolactin secretion is increased \r\nby serotonin, which is one of the substances increased by salt restriction, \r\nbut prolactin itself can promote the loss of sodium in the urine (Ibarra, \r\net al., 2005), and contributes to vascular leakage and hypertension.In \r\npregnancy, estrogen excess or progesterone deficiency is an important \r\nfactor in the harmful effects of sodium restriction and protein deficiency. \r\nA deficiency of protein contributes to hypothyroidism, which is responsible \r\nfor the relative estrogen excess.Protein, \r\nsalt, thyroid, and progesterone happen to be thermogenic, increasing \r\nheat production and stabilizing body temperature at a higher level. \r\nProlactin and estrogen lower the temperature set-point.The \r\ndownward shift of temperature and energy metabolism in toxemia or salt \r\ndeprivation tends to slow the use of oxygen, increasing the glycolytic \r\nuse of sugar, and contributing to the formation of lactic acid, rather \r\nthan carbon dioxide. In preeclampsia, serum lactate is increased, even \r\nwhile freefatty acids \r\nare interfering with the use of glucose.One \r\nway of looking at those facts is to see that a lack of sodium slows \r\nmetabolism, lowers carbon dioxide production, and creates inflammation, \r\nstress and degeneration. Rephrasing it, sodium stimulates energy metabolism, \r\nincreases carbon dioxide production, and protects against inflammation \r\nand other maladaptive stress reactions.In \r\nrecent years, Weissmans wear-and-tear theory of aging, and \r\nPearls rate of living theory have been clearly refuted by metabolic \r\nstudies that are showing that intensified mitochondrial respiration \r\ndecreases cellular damage, and supports a longer life-span.Many \r\ndog owners are aware that small dogs eat much more food in proportion \r\nto their size than big dogs do. And small dogs have a much greater life \r\nexpectancy than big dogs, in some cases about twice as long (Speakman, \r\n2003).Organisms \r\nas different as yeasts and rodents show a similar association of metabolic \r\nintensity and life-span. A variety of hamster with a 20% higher metabolic \r\nrate lived 15% longer than hamsters with an average metabolic rate (Oklejewicz \r\nand Daan, 2002).Individuals \r\nwithin a strain of mice were found to vary considerably in their metabolic \r\nrate. The 25% of the mice with the highest rate used 30% more energy \r\n(per gram of body weight) than the 25% with the lowest metabolic rate, \r\nand lived 36% longer (Speakman, et al., 2000).The \r\nmitochondria of these animals are uncoupled, that is, their use \r\nof oxygen isnt directly proportional to the production of ATP. This \r\nmeans that they are producing more carbon dioxide without necessarily \r\nproducing more ATP, and that even at rest they are using a considerable \r\namount of energy.One \r\nimportant function of carbon dioxide is to regulate the movement of \r\npositively charged alkali metal ions, such as sodium and calcium. When \r\ntoo much calcium enters a cell it activates many enzymes, prevents muscle \r\nand nerve cells from relaxing, and ultimately kills the cell. The constant \r\nformation of acidic carbon dioxide in the cell allows the cell to remove \r\ncalcium, along with the small amount of sodium which is constantly entering \r\nthe cell.When \r\nthere is adequate sodium in the extracellular fluid, the continuous \r\ninward movement of sodium ions into the resting cell activates an enzyme, \r\nsodium-potassium ATPase, causing ATP to break down into ADP and phosphate, \r\nwhich stimulates the consumption of fuel and oxygen to maintain an adequate \r\nlevel of ATP. Increasing the concentration of sodium increases the energy \r\nconsumption and carbon dioxide production of the cell. The sodium, by \r\nincreasing carbon dioxide production, protects against the excitatory, \r\ntoxic effects of the intracellular calcium.Hypertonic \r\nsolutions, containing more than the normal concentration of sodium (from \r\nabout twice normal to 8 or 10 times normal) are being used to rescuscitate \r\npeople and animals after injury. Rather than just increasing blood volume \r\nto restore circulation, the hypertonic sodium restores cellular energy \r\nproduction, increasing oxygen consumption and heat production while \r\nreducing free radical production, improves the contraction and relaxation \r\nof the heart muscle, and reduces inflammation, vascular permeability, \r\nand edema.Seawater, \r\nwhich is hypertonic to our tissues, has often been used for treating \r\nwounds, and much more concentrated salt solutions have been found effective \r\nfor accelerating wound healing (Mangete, et al., 1993).There \r\nhave been several publications suggesting that increasing the amount \r\nof salt in the diet might cause stomach cancer, because countries such \r\nas Japan with a high salt intake have a high incidence of stomach cancer.Studies \r\nin which animals were fed popular Japanese foods--salted \r\ncuttlefish guts, broiled, salted, dried sardines, pickled radish, and \r\nsoy sauce--besides a \r\nchemical carcinogen, showed that the Japanese foods increased the number \r\nof tumors. But another study, adding only soy sauce (with a salt content \r\nof about 18%) to the diet did not increase the incidence of cancer, \r\nin another it was protective against stomach cancer (Benjamin, et al., \r\n1991). Several studies show that dried fish and pickled vegetables are \r\ncarcinogenic, probably because of the oxidized fats, and other chemical \r\nchanges, and fungal contamination, which are likely to be worse without \r\nthe salt. Animals fed dried fish were found to have mutagenic urine, \r\napparently as a result of toxic materials occurring in various preserved \r\nfoods (Fong, et al., 1979).Although \r\npreserved foods develop many peculiar toxins, even fresh fish in the \r\ndiet have been found to be associated with increased cancer risk (Phukan, \r\net al., 2006).When \r\nsmall animals were given a milliliter of a saturated salt solution with \r\nthe carcinogen, the number of tumors was increased with the salt. However, \r\nwhen the salt was given with mucin, it had no cancer promoting effect. \r\nSince the large amount of a saturated salt solution breaks down the \r\nstomachs protective mucus coating, the stomach cells were not protected \r\nfrom the carcinogen. Rather than showing that salt causes stomach cancer, \r\nthe experiments showed that a cup or more of saturated salt solution, \r\nor several ounces of pure salt, shouldnt be ingested at the same \r\ntime as a strong carcinogen.Some \r\nstudies have found pork to be associated with cancer of the esophagous \r\n(Nagai, et al., 1982), thyroid (Markaki, \r\net al., 2003), and other organs,but an experiment with beef, chicken, or bacon diet in rats provides \r\nanother perspective on the role of salt in carcinogenesis. After being \r\ngiven a carcinogen, rats were fed meat diets, containing either 30% \r\nor 60% of freeze-dried fried beef, chicken, or bacon. Neither beef nor \r\nchicken changed the incidence of precancerous lesions in the intestine, \r\nbut the incidence was reduced by 12% in the animals on the 30% bacon \r\ndiet, and by 20% in rats getting the diet with 60% bacon. Salt apparently \r\nmade the difference.Other \r\nprotective effects of increased sodium are that it improves immunity \r\n(Junger, et al., 1994), reduces vascular leakiness, and alleviates inflammation \r\n(Cara, et al., 1988). All of these effects would tend to protect against \r\nthe degenerative diseases, including tumors, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimers \r\ndisease. The RAA system appears to be crucially involved in all kinds \r\nof sickness and degeneration, but the protective effects of sodium are \r\nmore basic than just helping to prevent activation of that system.A \r\nslight decrease in temperature can promote inflammation (Matsui, et \r\nal., 2006). The thermogenic substances--dietary protein, sodium, sucrose, \r\nthyroid and progesterone--are antiinflammatory for many reasons, but \r\nvery likely the increased temperature itself is important.A \r\npoor reaction to stress, with increased cortisol, can raise the body \r\ntemperature by accelerating the breakdown and resynthesis of proteins, \r\nbut adaptive resistance to stress increases the temperature by increasing \r\nthe consumption of oxygen and fuel. In the presence of increased cortisol, \r\nabdominal fat increases, along with circulating fatty acids and calcium, \r\nas mitochondrial respiration is suppressed.When \r\nmice are chilled, they spontaneously prefer slightly salty water, rather \r\nthan fresh, and it increases their heat production (Dejima, et al., \r\n1996). When rats are given 0.9 per cent sodium chloride solution with \r\ntheir regular food, their heat production increases, and their body \r\nfat, including abdominal fat, decreases (Bryant, et al., 1984). These \r\nresponses to increased dietary sodium are immediate. Part of the effect \r\nof sodium involves regulatory processes in the brain, which are sensitive \r\nto the ratio between sodium and calcium. Decreasing sodium, or increasing \r\ncalcium, causes the bodys metabolism to shift away from thermogenesis \r\nand accelerated respiration.Regulating \r\nintracellular calcium by increasing the production of carbon dioxide \r\nis probably a basic mechanism in sodiums protection against inflammation \r\nand excitatory cell damage and degeneration.Cortisols \r\nsuppression of mitochondrial respiration is closely associated with \r\nits ability to increase intracellular calcium. Cortisol blocks the thermogenic \r\neffects of sodium, allowing intracellular calcium to damage cells. With \r\naging, the tissues are more susceptible to these processes.The \r\nthermogenic effects of sodium can be seen in long-term studies, as well \r\nas short. A low-sodium diet accelerates the decrease in heat production \r\nthat normally occurs with aging, lowering the metabolic rate of brown \r\nfat and body temperature, and increasing the fat content of the body, \r\nas well as the activity of the fat synthesizing enzyme (Xavier, et al., \r\n2003).Activation \r\nof heat production and increased body temperature might account for \r\nsome of the GABA-like sedative effects of increased sodium. Increasing \r\nGABA in the brain increases brown fat heat production (Horton, et al., \r\n1988). Activation of heat production by brown fat increases slow wave \r\nsleep (Dewasmes, et al., 2003), the loss of which is characteristic \r\nof aging. (In adult humans, the skeletal muscles have heat-producing \r\nfunctions similar to brown fat.)Now \r\nthat inflammation is recognized as having a central role in the degenerative \r\ndiseases, the fact that renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone all contribute \r\nto inflammation and are increased by a sodium deficiency, should arouse \r\ninterest in exploring the therapeutic uses of sodium supplementation, \r\nand the integrated use of all of the factors that normally support respiratory \r\nenergy production, especially thyroid and progesterone. Progesterones \r\nantagonism to aldosterone has been known for many years, and the synthetic \r\nantialdosterone drugs are simply poor imitations of progesterone.But \r\nthe drug industry is interested in selling new drugs to block the formation \r\nand action of each of the components of the RAAS, rather than an inexpensive \r\nmethod (such as nutrition) to normalize the system.REFERENCESJ \r\nHum Hypertens. 2002 Dec;16(12):843-50.Salt supresses baseline muscle \r\nsympathetic nerve activity in salt-sensitive and salt-resistant hypertensives.Abrahão SB, Tinucci T, Santello JL, Mion D Jr.Neuropharmacology. \r\n1986 Jun;25(6):627-31.Activation of thermogenesis of brown fat in \r\nrats by baclofen.Addae JI, Rothwell NJ, Stock MJ, Stone TW.Hypertension \r\n25: 1144-1152, 1995:Low urinary sodium is associated with greater \r\nrisk of myocardial infarction among treated hypertensive men.Alderman \r\nMH, Madhavan S, Cohen H, Sealey JE, Laragh JHThe \r\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I).

Many people are doing valid research \r\nrelating to cell renewal and regeneration, but its usefulness is seriously \r\nlimited by cultural and commercial constraints. By recovering some of \r\nour suppressed traditional culture, I think regenerative therapies can \r\nbe developed quickly, by identifying and eliminating as far as possible \r\nthe main factors that interfere with tissue renewal.Science \r\ngrew up in the highly authoritarian cultures of western Europe, and \r\neven as it contributed to cultural change, it kept an authoritarian \r\nmystique. Any culture functions as a system of definitions of reality \r\nand the limits of possibility, and to a great extent the \"laws \r\nof nature\" are decreed so that they will harmonize with the recognized \r\nlaws of society.The \r\npractical success of Newton's \"laws\" of motion when they were \r\napplied to ballistics and \"rocket science\" has led many people \r\nto value calculation, based on those laws, over evidence. In biology, \r\nthe idea that an organism is \"the information it contains in its \r\nDNA blueprint\" is an extention of this. The organism is turned \r\ninto something like a deductive expression of the law of DNA. This attitude \r\nhas been disastrous.The \r\nold feudal idea of a divine and stable social organization was applied \r\nby some people to their idea of biological organization, in which each \r\ncell (ruled by its nucleus) had its ordained place in the organism, \r\nwith the brain and the \"master gland,\" the pituitary, ruling \r\nthe subordinate organs, tissues, and cells. \"Anatomy\" was \r\ntaught from dead specimens, microscope slides, and illustrations in \r\nbooks. Most biologists' thoughts about cells in organisms reflect the \r\nstatic imagery of their instruction. (\"The histological image \r\nof these tissues actually reflects an instantaneous picture of cells \r\nin a continuous flux.\"Zajicek, 1981.)When \r\na person has playful and observant interactions with natural things, \r\nboth regularities and irregularities will be noticed, and in trying \r\nto understand those events, the richness of the experience will suggest \r\nan expansive range of possibilities. Perception and experimentation \r\nlead to understandings that are independent of culture and tradition.But \r\nthe mystique of science easily imposes itself, and distracts our attention \r\nfrom direct interactions with things. As we learn to operate lab instruments, \r\nwe are taught the kinds of results that can be expected, and the concepts \r\nthat will explain and predict the results of our operations. Science, \r\nas we learn about it in schools and the mass media, is mostly a set \r\nof catechisms.Our \r\ntheories about organisms inform our experiments with cells or tissues \r\nthat have been isolated from those organisms. The conditions for growing \r\ncells in dishes are thought of as \"physiological,\" in relation \r\nto the solution's \"physiological osmolarity,\" \"physiological \r\npH,\" nutrients, oxygenation, temperature, pressure, etc. But these \r\nconcepts of what is physiological derive from the monolithic ideology \r\nof the doctrinaire, and often fraudulent, mainstream of biological science.The \r\ncatechismic nature of science has led people to expect some \"break-throughs\" \r\n\r\nto occur in certain areas, and as authoritarian science has grown into \r\n\"big science\" managed by corporations and governments, those \r\nbreak-throughs are generally expected to be produced by the newest and \r\nmost expensive developments of \"high technology.\"But \r\nlooking closely at the real events and processes in the sciences in \r\nthe last couple of centuries, it turns out that useful advances have \r\nbeen produced mainly by breaking away from authoritarian doctrines, \r\nto return to common sense and relatively simple direct observations.Although \r\npeople were cloning animals in the 1960s, it was still widely taught \r\nthat it was impossible. The students of the professors who taught that \r\nit was impossible are now saying that it requires high technology and \r\nnew research.For \r\nthe last 100 years the most authoritative view in biology has been that \r\nthere are no stem cells in adults, that brains, hearts, pancreases and \r\noocytes are absolutely incapable of regeneration. But now, people seem \r\nto be finding stem cells wherever they look, but there is a mystique \r\nof high technology involved in finding and using them.Whether \r\nit's deliberate or not, the emphasis on stem cell technology has the \r\nfunction of directing attention away from traditional knowledge, the \r\nway allopathic medicine has de-emphasized the intrinsic ability of people \r\nto recover from disease.This \r\nresembles the way that the Mendel-Morgan gene doctrine was used to suppress \r\nthe knowledge gained from centuries of experience of plant and animal \r\nbreeders, and to belittle the discoveries of Luther Burbank, Paul Kammerer, \r\nTrofim Lysenko, and Barbara McClintock. The same type of biochemical \r\nprocess that caused the hereditary changes those researchers studied \r\nare involved in the differentiation and dedifferentiation of stem cells \r\nthat regulate healing and regeneration.In \r\nthe 1940s, even children discussed the biological discoveries of the \r\n1920s and 1930s, the work in regeneration and adaptation, parthenogenesis, \r\nand immortalization. The ideas of J. Loeb, T. Boveri, A. Gurwitsch, \r\nJ. Needham, C.M. Child, A. Carrel, et al., had become part of the general \r\nculture.But \r\nthat real biology was killed by a consortium of industry and government \r\nthat began a little before the second world war. In 1940, the government \r\nwas supporting research in chemical and biological warfare, and with \r\nthe Manhattan Project the role of government became so large that all \r\nof the major research universities were affected. Shortly after the \r\nwar, many researchers from the Manhattan Project were redeployed into \r\n\"molecular genetics,\" where the engineering attitude was applied \r\nto organisms.The \r\nsimplistic genetic dogmas were compatible with the reductionist engineering \r\napproach to the organism. The role of the government assured that the \r\nuniversities would subscribe to the basic scientific agenda. The atmosphere \r\nof that time was described by Carl Lindegren as \"The Cold War in \r\nBiology\" (1966).The \r\ndisappearance of the field concept in developmental biology was one \r\nof the strangest events in the history of science. It didn't just fade \r\naway, it was \"disappeared,\" in a massive undertaking of social \r\nengineering. In its absence, stem cells will seem to be a profitable \r\ntechnological marvel, rather than a universal life function, with a \r\ncentral role in everything we are and everything we do and can become.Many \r\npeople have tried to explain aging as a loss of cells, resulting from \r\nan intrinsic inability of any cell other than a germ cell to multiply \r\nmore than a certain number of times. More than 40 years ago Leonard \r\nHayflick popularized this doctrine in its most extreme form, saying \r\nthat no cell can divide more than 50 times unless it is converted into \r\na cancer cell. He and his followers claimed that they had explained \r\nwhy organisms must age and die. At the moment the ovum is fertilized, \r\nthe clock starts ticking for the essentially mortal somatic cells.In \r\n1970, it was being seriously proposed that memory was produced by the \r\ndeath of brain cells, in a manner analogous to the holes punched in \r\ncards to enter data into computers. The cultural dogma made it impossible \r\nto consider that learning could be associated with the birth of new \r\ncells in the adult brain.With \r\nthe announcement in 1997 of the cloning of the sheep Dolly from a somatic \r\ncell taken from a 6 year old sheep, there was renewed interest in the \r\nidea made famous by Alexis Carrel that all cells are potentially immortal, \r\nand in the possibility of preserving the vitality of human cells. Within \r\na few months, Hayflick began reminding the public that \"In the \r\nearly 1960's we overthrew this dogma after finding that normal cells \r\ndo have a finite replicative capacity.\" (\"During the first \r\nhalf of this century it was believed that because cultured normal cells \r\nwere immortal, aging must be caused by extra-cellular events.\") \r\nThe way Hayflick \"overthrew\" more than 35 years of work at \r\nthe Rockefeller Institute was by growing one type of cell, a lung fibroblast, \r\nin culture dishes, and finding that the cultures deteriorated quickly.To \r\ndraw global conclusions about an organism's development and aging from \r\nthe degenerative processes seen in a single type of cell, grown in isolation \r\nfrom all normal stimuli, would have been treated as nothing but wild \r\nspeculation, except that it occurred within a culture that needed it. \r\nNo aspect of Hayflick's cell culture system could properly be called \r\nphysiological.Other \r\nresearchers, simply by changing a single factor, caused great increases \r\nin the longevity of the cultured cells. Simply using a lower, more natural \r\noxygen concentration, the cells were able to undergo 20 more divisions. \r\nJust by adding niacin, 30 more divisions; vitamin E, 70 more divisions. \r\nExcess oxygen is a poison requiring constant adaptation.Hayflick \r\nalso published the observation that, while the cells kept in dishes \r\nat approximately body temperature deteriorated, cells kept frozen in \r\nliquid nitrogen didn't deteriorate, and he concluded that \"time\" \r\nwasn't the cause of aging. When I read his comments about the frozen \r\ncells, I wondered how anyone of normal intelligence could make such \r\nstupid statements. Since then, facts that came out because of the Freedom \r\nof Information Act, cause me to believe that a financial motive guided \r\nhis thoughts about his cultured fibroblasts.Hayflick \r\nand his followers have been attacking the idea of anti-aging medicine \r\nas quackery. But he is closely involved with the Geron corporation, \r\nwhich proposes that genetic alterations relating to telomeres may be \r\nable to cure cancer and prevent aging. Their claims were reported by \r\nCNN as \"Scientists discover cellular 'fountain of youth'.\"The \r\n\"wear and tear\" doctrine of aging that derived from the ideology \r\nof the gene was reinforced and renewed by Hayflick's cell culture observations, \r\nand it continued to rule the universities and popular culture.But \r\ndetailed investigation of skin cell growth showed that cells in the \r\nlower layer of the skin divide at least 10,000 times in a normal lifetime, \r\nand similar processes occur in the lining of the intestine. The endometrium \r\nand other highly renewable tissues just as obviously violated Hayflick's \r\nlimit. Transplantation experiments showed that pieces of mammary tissue \r\nor skin tissue could survive through ten normal lifetimes of experimental \r\nanimals without suffering the effects of aging.Even \r\nthe liver and adrenal gland are now known to be continuously renewed \r\nby \"cell streaming,\" though at a slower rate than the skin, \r\nconjunctiva, and intestine. Neurogenesis in the brain is now not only \r\nwidely accepted, it is even proposed as a mechanism to explain the therapeutic \r\neffects of antidepressants (Santarelli, et al., 2003).August \r\nWeismann's most influential doctrine said that \"somatic cells are \r\nmortal, only the germline cells are immortal,\" but he based the \r\ndoctrine on his mistaken belief that only the \"germline\" cells \r\ncontained all the genes of the organism. In 1885, to \"refute\" \r\nDarwin's belief that acquired traits could be inherited, he promulgated \r\nan absolute \"barrier\" between \"germline\" and \"soma,\" \r\n\r\nand invented facts to show that hereditary information can flow only \r\nfrom the germline to the somatic cells, and not the other direction. \r\nShortly after DNA became popular in the 1950s as \"the genetic material,\" \r\nWeismann's barrier was restated as the Central Dogma of molecular genetics, \r\nthat information flows only from DNA to RNA to protein, and never the \r\nother direction.It \r\nwas only in 2003, after the reality of cloning was widely recognized, \r\nthat a few experimenters began to investigate the origin of \"germline\" \r\ncells in the ovary, and to discover that they derive from somatic cells \r\n(Johnson, et al., 2004). With this discovery, the ancient knowledge \r\nthat a twig (klon, in Greek) cut from a tree could grow into \r\na whole tree, bearing fruit and viable seeds, was readmitted to general \r\nbiology, and the Weismann barrier was seen to be an illusion.Millions \r\nof people have \"explained\" female reproductive aging as the \r\nconsequence of the ovary \"running out of eggs.\" Innumerable \r\npublications purported to show the exact ways in which that process \r\noccurs, following the Weismann doctrine. But now that it is clear that \r\nadult ovaries can give birth to new oocytes, a new explanation for female \r\nreproductive aging is needed. It is likely that the same factors that \r\ncause female reproductive aging also cause aging of other systems and \r\norgans and tissues, and that those factors are extrinsic to the cells \r\nthemselves, as Alexis Carrel and others demonstrated long ago. This \r\nis a way of saying that all cells are potential stem cells. The \"niche\" \r\n\r\nin which new cells are born in the streaming organism, and the processes \r\nby which damaged cells are removed, are physiological issues that can \r\nbe illuminated by the idea of a morphogenetic field.When \r\nthe post-war genetic engineers took over biological research, the idea \r\nof a biophysical field was totally abandoned, but after about 15 years, \r\nit became necessary to think of problems beyond those existing within \r\na single bacterium, namely, the problem of how an ovum becomes and embryo. \r\nFrancis Crick, of DNA fame, who was educated as a physicist, revived \r\n(without a meaningful historical context) the idea of a diffusion gradient \r\nas a simple integrating factor that wouldn't be too offensive to the \r\nreductionists. But for events far beyond the scale of the egg's internal \r\nstructure, for example to explain how a nerve axon can travel a very \r\nlong distance to innervate exactly the right kind of cell, the diffusion \r\nof molecules loses its simplicity and plausibility. (Early in the history \r\nof experimental embryology, it was observed that electrical fields affect \r\nthe direction of growth of nerve fibers.)C. \r\nM. Child saw a gradient of metabolic activity as an essential component \r\nof the morphogenetic field. This kind of gradient doesn't deny the existence \r\nof diffusion gradients, or other physical components of a field. Electrical \r\nand osmotic (and electro-osmotic) events are generated by metabolism, \r\nand affect other factors, including pH, oxidation and reduction, cell \r\nmotility and cell shape, ionic selectivity and other types of cellular \r\nselectivity and specificity. Gradients of DNA methylation exist, and \r\naffect the expression of inherited information.Methylation \r\ndecreases the expression of particular genes, and during the differention \r\nof cells in the development of an embryo, genes are methylated and demethylated \r\nas the cell adapts to produce the proteins that are involved in the \r\nstructure and function of a particular tissue. Methylation (which increases \r\na molecule's affinity for fats) is a widespread process in cells, and \r\nfor example regulates cellular excitability. It is affected by diet \r\nand a variety of stresses.DNA \r\nmethylation patterns are normally fairly stable, and can help to account \r\nfor the transgenerational transmission of acquired adaptations, and \r\nfor neonatal imprinting that can last a lifetime. But with injury, stress, \r\nand aging, the methylation patterns of differentiated tissues can be \r\nchanged, contributing to the development of tumors, or to the loss of \r\ncellular functions. Even learning can change the methylation of specific \r\ngenes. Duringin vitroculture, the enzymes of gene methylation \r\nare known to be increased, relative to their normal activity (Wang, \r\net al., 2005).The \r\nphenomenon of \"gene\" methylation in response to environmental \r\nand metabolic conditions may eventually lead to the extinction of the \r\ndoctrine that \"cells are controlled by their genes.\"During \r\nsuccessful adaptation to stress, cells make adjustments to their metabolic \r\nsystems (for example with a holistic change of the degree of phosphorylation, \r\nwhich increases molecules' affinity for water), and their metabolic \r\nprocesses can contribute to changes in their state of differentiation. \r\nSome changes may lead to successful adaptation (for example by producing \r\nbiogenic stimulators that stimulate cell functioning and regeneration), \r\nothers to failed adaptation. Even the decomposition of cells can release \r\nsubstances that contribute to the adaptation of surrounding cells, for \r\nexample when sphingosines stimulate the production of stem cells.DNA \r\nmethylation is just one relatively stable event that occurs in relation \r\nto a metabolic field.  Modifications of histones (regulatory proteins \r\nin chromosomes, which are acetylated as well as methylated) and structural-contractile \r\nfilaments also contribute to the differentiation of cells, but the pattern \r\nof DNA methylation seems to guide the methylation of histones and the \r\nstructure of the chromosomes (Nan, et al., 1998).Steroids \r\nand phospholipids, neurotransmitters and endorphins, ATP, GTP, other \r\nphosphates, retinoids, NO and CO2--many materials and processes participate \r\nin the coherence of the living state, the living substance. Carbon dioxide, \r\nfor example, by binding to lysine amino groups in the histones, will \r\ninfluence their methylation.  Carbon dioxide is likely to affect \r\nother amino groups in the chromosomes.The \r\nnumber and arrangement of mitochondria is an important factor in producing \r\nand maintaining the metabolic gradients. Things that decrease mitochondrial \r\nenergy production--nitric oxide, histamine, cytokines, cortisol--increase \r\nDNA methylation. Decreased gene expression is associated with reduced \r\nrespiratory energy. It seems reasonable to guess that increased gene \r\nexpression would demand increased availability of energy.As \r\nan ovum differentiates into an organism, cells become progressively \r\nmore specialized, inhibiting the expression of many genes. Less energy \r\nis needed by stably functioning cells, than by actively adapting cells. \r\nA.I. Zotin described the process of maturing and differentiating as \r\na decrease of entropy, an increase of order accompanying a decreased \r\nenergy expenditure. The entropic egg develops into a less entropic embryo \r\nwith a great expenditure of energy.The \r\npartially differentiated stem cell doesn't go through all the stages \r\nof development, but it does expend energy intensely as it matures.The \r\nrestoration of energy is one requirement for the activation of regeneration. \r\nWhen a hormone such as noradrenaline or insulin causes a stem cell to \r\ndifferentiate in vitro, it causes new mitochondria to form. This is \r\nsomewhat analogous to the insertion of mitochondria into the ripening \r\noocyte, by the nurse cells that surround it. The conditionally decreased \r\nentropy of maturation is reversed, and when sufficient respiratory energy \r\nis available, the renewed and refreshed cell will be able to renew an \r\nappropriate degree of differentiation.When \r\nsimple organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, or protozoa are stressed, \r\nfor example by the absence of nutrients or the presence of toxins, they \r\nslow their metabolism, and suppress the expression of genes, increasing \r\nthe methylation of DNA, to form resistant and quiescent spores. Our \r\ndifferentiated state doesn't go to the metabolic extreme seen in sporulation, \r\nbut it's useful to look at maturity and aging in this context, because \r\nit suggests that the wrong kind of stress decreases the ability of the \r\norganism to adapt, by processes resembling those in the spore-forming \r\norganisms.Charles \r\nVacanti, who has grown cartilage from cells taken from 100 year old \r\nhuman cartilage, believes our tissues contain \"spore cells,\" \r\nvery small cells with slow metabolism and extreme resistance to heat, \r\ncold, and starvation.If \r\nthe slowed metabolism of aging, like that of sporulating cells, is produced \r\nby a certain kind of stress that lowers cellular energy and functions, \r\nit might be useful to think of the other stages of the stress reaction \r\nin relation to the production of stem cells. Selye divided stress into \r\na first stage of shock, followed by a prolonged adaptation, which could \r\nsometimes end in exhaustion. If the maturity of differentiated functioning \r\nis equivalent to the adaptation phase, and cellular decline and disintegration \r\nis the exhaustion phase, then the shock-like reaction would correspond \r\nto the birth of new stem cells.Selye \r\ndescribed estrogen's effects as equivalent to the shock-phase of stress. \r\nEstrogen's basic action is to make oxygen unavailable, lowering the \r\noxygen tension of the tissues, locally and temporarily. Like nitric \r\noxide, which is produced by estrogenic stimulation, estrogen interferes \r\nwith energy production, so if its stimulation is prolonged, cells are \r\ndamaged or killed, rather than being stimulated to regenerate.Extrinsic \r\nfactors elicit renewal, the way stress can elicit adaptation. While \r\naging cells can't use the oxygen that is present, a scarcity of oxygen \r\ncan serve as a stimulus to maximize the respiratory systems. Brief oxygen \r\ndeprivation excites a cell, causes it to swell, and to begin to divide.Oxygen \r\ndeprivation, as in the normally hypoxic bone marrow, stimulates the \r\nformation of stem cells, as well as the biogenesis of mitochondria. \r\nAs the newly formed cells, with abundant mitochondria, get adequate \r\noxygen, they begin differentiation.Form, \r\nbased on cellular differentiation, follows function--a vein transplanted \r\ninto an artery develops anatomically into an artery, a colon attached \r\ndirectly to the anus becomes a new rectum with its appropriate innervation, \r\na broken bone restructures to form a normal bone. If the bladder is \r\nforced to function more than normal, by artificially keeping it filled, \r\nits thin wall of smooth muscle develops into a thick wall of striated \r\nmuscle that rhythmically contracts, like the heart. If a tadpole is \r\ngiven a vegetarian diet, the absorptive surface of its digestive system \r\nwill develop to be twice the size of those that are fed meat. Pressure, \r\nstretching, and pulsation are among the signals that guide cells' differentiation.Very \r\nearly in the study of embryology it was noticed that the presence of \r\none tissue sometimes induced the differentiation of another kind, and \r\nalso that there were factors in embryonic tissues that would stimulate \r\ncell division generally, and others that could inhibit the growth of \r\na particular tissue type. Diffusable substances and light were among \r\nthe factors identified as growth regulators.Extracts \r\nof particular tissues were found to suppress the multiplication of cells \r\nin that type of tissue, in adult animals as well as in embryos. In the \r\n1960s, the tissue-specific inhibitors were called chalones.The \r\nbrain's development is governed by the presence in the organism of the \r\nbody part to which it corresponds, such as the eyes or legs. The number \r\nof cells in a particular part of the nervous system is governed by the \r\nquantity of nervous input, sensory or motor, that it receives. An enriched \r\nenvironment causes a bigger brain to grow. Sensory nerve stimulation \r\nof a particular region of the brain causes nerve cells to migrate to \r\nthat area (a process called neurobiotaxis; deBeers, 1927), but nerve \r\nstimulation also causes mitochondria to accumulate in stimulated areas. \r\nNerve activity has a trophic, sustaining influence on other organs, \r\nas well as on the brain. Nerve stimulation, like mechanical pressure \r\nor stretching, is an important signal for cellular differentiation.When \r\nstem cells or progenitor cells are called on to replace cells in an \r\norgan, they are said to be \"recruited\" by that organ, or to \r\n\"home\" to that organ, if they are coming from elsewhere. Traditionally, \r\nthe bone marrow has been considered to be the source of circulating \r\nstem cells, but it now appears that a variety of other less differentiated \r\ncells can be recruited when needed. Cells from the blood can repair \r\nthe endothelium of blood vessels, and endothelial cells can become mesenchymal \r\ncells, in the heart, for example.The \r\nstandard doctrine about cancer is that a tumor derives from a single \r\nmutant cell, but it has been known for a long time that different types \r\nof cell, such as phagocytes and mast cells, usually reside in tumors, \r\nand it is now becoming clear that tumors recruit cells, including apparently \r\nnormal cells, from other parts of the same organ. For example, a brain \r\ntumor of glial cells, a glioma, recruits glial cells from surrounding \r\nareas of the brain, in a process that's analogous to the embryological \r\nmovement of nerve cells to a center of excitation. Each tumor, in a \r\nsense, seems to be a center of excitation, and its fate seems to depend \r\non the nature of the cells that respond to its signals.To \r\naccommodate some of the newer facts about tumors, the cancer establishment \r\nhas begun speaking of \"the cancer stem cell\" as the real villain, \r\nthe origin of the tumor, while the bulk of the tumor is seen to be made \r\nup of defective cells that have a short life-span. But if we recognize \r\nthat tumors are recruiting cells from beyond their boundaries, this \r\nprocess would account for the growth and survival of a tumor even while \r\nmost of its cells are inert and dying, without invoking the invisible \r\ncancer stem cell. And this view, that it is the field which is defective \r\nrather than the cell, is consistent with the evidence which has been \r\naccumulating for 35 years that tumor cells, given the right environment, \r\ncan differentiate into healthy cells. (Hendrix, et al., 2007)Simply \r\nstretching an organ (Woo, et al., 2007) is stimulus enough to cause \r\nit to recruit cells from the bloodstream, and will probably stimulate \r\nmultiplication in its local resident cells, too. Every \"cancer \r\nfield\" probably begins as a healing process, and generally the \r\nhealing and regeneration are at least partially successful.When \r\nan organ--the brain, heart, liver, or a blood vessel--is inflamed or \r\nsuffering from an insufficient blood supply, stem cells introduced into \r\nthe blood will migrate specifically to that organ.Organ \r\nspecific materials (chalones) are known to circulate in the blood, inhibiting \r\ncell division in cells typical to that organ, but it also seems that \r\norgan specific materials are secreted by a damaged organ, that help \r\nto prepare stem cells for their migration into that organ. When undifferentiated \r\ncells are cultured with serum from a person with liver failure, they \r\nbegin to differentiate into liver cells.It \r\nis still common to speak of each organ as having a \"clonal origin\" \r\nin the differentiating embryo, as a simple expansion of a certain embryonic \r\nanlage. The implication of this way of thinking is that differentiation \r\nisdeterminationin an irreversible sense. This is another case \r\nof medical ideas being based on images of fixed histological material. \r\nNormal cells, including nerve and muscle cells, can change type, with \r\nconnective tissue cells becoming nerve cells, nerve cells becoming muscle \r\nand fiber cells, fat, fiber, and muscle cells redifferentiating, for \r\nexample.Cell \r\nmovements in solid tissues aren't limited to the short distances between \r\ncapillaries and the tissues nourished by those capillaries, rather, \r\ncells can migrate much greater distances, without entering the bloodstream. \r\nThe speed of a single cell moving by ameboid motion can be measured \r\nby watching cells on a glass slide as they move toward food, or by watching \r\ncells of the slime mold Dictyostelium when they are aggregating, or \r\nby watching the pigment cells in and around moles or melanomas, under \r\nthe influence of hormones. At body temperature, a single cell can crawl \r\nabout an inch per day. Waves or spots of brown pigment can be seen migrating \r\nthrough the skin away from a mole, preceding the disintegration of the \r\nmole under the influence of progesterone or DHEA. Under ordinary conditions, \r\npigment cells can sometimes be seen migrating into depigmented areas \r\nof skin, during the recovery of an area affected by vitiligo. These \r\norganized movements of masses of cells happen to be easy to see, but \r\nthere is evidence that other types of cell can reconstruct tissues by \r\ntheir ameboid movements, when circumstances are right. Tumors or tissue \r\nabnormalities can appear or disappear with a suddenness that seems impossible \r\nto people who have studied only fixed tissue preparations.Stimulation \r\nis anabolic, building tissue, when the organism is adapting to the stimulation. \r\nUnused structures in cells and tissues are always being recycled by \r\nmetabolic processes. When tissues are injured and become unable to function, \r\nsome of their substances stimulate the growth of replacement cells.Some \r\ntypes of injury or irritation can activate regenerative processes. A \r\ndermatology journal described the case of an old man who had been bald \r\nfor many years who fell head-first into his fireplace. As his burned \r\nscalp healed, new hair grew. In the U.S., experimenters (Ito, et al., \r\n2007) have found that injuring the skin of mice stimulates the formation \r\nof stem cells that are able to become hair follicle cells, supporting \r\nthe regeneration of cells that had been absent. A brief exposure to \r\nestrogen, and other stress related signals (nitric oxide, endorphin, \r\nprostaglandins) can initiate stem cell proliferation.In \r\nthe years after the first world war, Vladimir Filatov, who developed \r\ntechniques of reconstructive surgery, including corneal transplants, \r\nfound that cold storage of tissues (for example, corneas from cadavers) \r\ncaused them to function better than fresh tissues, and he found that \r\nthese stressed tissues would often spread a healing influence out into \r\nthe surrounding tissues. Extracts of stressed tissues produced similar \r\neffects.L.V. \r\nPolezhaev began studying the regenerative capacities of mammals in the \r\nlate 1940s, and his work showed that processes similar to embryonic \r\ninduction are involved in the organism's responses to damaged tissues. \r\nFor example, when a piece of killed muscle tissue is enclosed in a capsule \r\n(\"diffusion chamber\") that permits molecules, but no cells, \r\nto diffuse through it, and implanted subcutaneously, it had no inductive \r\neffect on surrounding cells. But when the pores of the capsule allowed \r\ncells to enter, skeletal muscle formed where the dead tissue had been, \r\nand tissue resembling heart muscle formed outside the capsule. Phagocytosis \r\nhad been essential for the induction to occur.Macrophages \r\nare ordinarily thought of as \"antigen-presenting cells\" that \r\nhelp to activate the specific immune responses. But apparently phagocytosis \r\nis involved in the replacement of damaged tissues, by recruiting or \r\ninducing the differentiation of replacement cells. The phagocytosis \r\nfunction isn't limited to the blood cells commonly called phagocytes; \r\neven nerve cells can ingest particles and fragments of damaged tissues.Many \r\nfactors regulate the process of phagocytosis. Stress and lipid peroxidation \r\ndecrease phagocytosis (Izgüt-Uysal, et al., 2004), and also damage \r\nmitochondria and inhibit cell renewal.Unsaturated \r\nfatty acids inhibit phagocytosis (Guimaraes, et al., 1991, 1992; Costa \r\nRosa, et al., 1996; Virella, et al., 1989; Akamatsu, et al., 1990), \r\nand suppress mitochondrial function (Gomes, et al., 2006).  Dietary \r\nrestriction activates phagocytosis (Moriguchi, et al., 1989), suggesting \r\nthat normal diets contain suppressive materials.Subnormal \r\ntemperatures cause a shift from phagocytosis to inflammation. Light, \r\nespecially the red light which penetrates easily into tissues, activates \r\nthe formation of new cells as well as their differentiation. It affects \r\nenergy production, increasing the formation of mitochondria, and the \r\nactivity of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes. Red light accelerates \r\nwound healing, and improves the quality of the scar, reducing the amount \r\nof fibrosis. The daily cycling between darkness and light is probably \r\nan important factor in regulating the birth and differentiation of cells.Darkness \r\nsuppresses mitochondrial function, and light activates it. Prolonged \r\ndarkness increases cortisol, and cortisol (which makes cells more susceptible \r\nto excitotoxic death) inhibits stem cell proliferation (Li, et al., \r\n2006; Liu, et al., 2003). Neurogenesis is suppressed by stress, and \r\nincreased by spontaneous activity, and has a circadian rhythm. Aging \r\nand depression both involve a diminished ability to rhythmically lower \r\nthe production of cortisol. Cell renewal requires a rhythmic decrease \r\nin the exposure to cortisol..In \r\nthe spring, with increased day length, the brains of song-birds grow, \r\nwith an increased proliferation of cells in the part of the brain involved \r\nin singing. The production of progesterone increases in most animals \r\nin the spring, and it is the main hormone responsible for the birds' \r\nbrain growth.Progesterone \r\nand its metabolites protect brain cells against injury, and improve \r\nthe brain's ability to recover after traumatic injury (Brinton and Wang, \r\n2006). In the 1960s, Marion Diamond's group showed that environmental \r\nenrichment, or progesterone, caused brains to grow larger, and that \r\nthese changes were passed on to descendants in a cumulative, increasing \r\nway. This suggests that the factors that promote neurogenesis also cause \r\nchanges in the apparatus of reproduction and inheritance, that support \r\nthe development of the brain--probably including the methylation system, \r\nwhich is involved in regulating genes, and also mood and behavior.Women's \r\nmonthly cycles, in which a brief estrogen dominance is followed by sustained \r\nexposure to progesterone, are probably an important factor in the renewal \r\nof the cells of the brain and other organs, as well as those of the \r\nreproductive organs. The daily rhythms of hormones and metabolism are \r\nknown to be involved in the regulation of cell renewal.Environmental \r\nenrichment, learning, high altitude, and thyroid hormone promote the \r\nformation of new mitochondria, and stimulate stem cell proliferation. \r\nAt least in some laboratories, 20% oxygen, approximately the amount \r\nas in the atmosphere, suppresses the proliferation of stem cells (He, \r\net al., 2007). This was the unphysiologically high concentration of \r\noxygen used in Hayflick's cell cultures. At high altitudes, where tissues \r\nare exposed to less oxygen, and more carbon dioxide, there is a lower \r\nincidence of all the degenerative diseases, including cancer, heart \r\ndisease, and dementia. Improved cellular energy production and more \r\nactive renewal of cells would probably account for those differences.For \r\nCrick, the idea of a diffusion gradient to explain embryonic development \r\nwas simply an extension of his reductionist orientation, in which diffusing \r\nmolecules induced or inhibited bacterial genes, and in which genes controlled \r\ncells. For people with that orientation, the adaptive mutations described \r\nby Carl Lindegren, and later by John Cairns, or even the stress-induced \r\nvariability described by Lysenko, Strong, and McClintock, were heretical. \r\nPolezhaev's demonstration that cells could do something that molecular \r\ndiffusion didn't do, threatened to take biology away from the reductionists. \r\nIf the organism's adaptation to the environment involves changing its \r\nown genes, Crick's paradigm fails.Crick's \r\nCentral Dogma, derived from the ideology that produced Weismann's Barrier, \r\nhas been invoked by generations of professors who wanted to deny the \r\npossibility of adaptive tissue renewal and regeneration. Without the \r\ndogma, new ideas about aging and disease will be needed. If somatic \r\ncells can adjust their genes, and if they can also differentiate into \r\nnew eggs and sperms, new ideas about inheritance of acquired traits \r\nwill be needed.The \r\nreplacement of injured cells means that mutations need not accumulate. \r\nCell renewal with elimination of mutant cells has been observed in sun-damaged \r\nskin simply by stopping the damage, and mitochondria with damaged DNA \r\ncan be replaced by healthy mitochondria simply by doing the right kind \r\nof exercise.The \r\nregulation of cell renewal probably involves all of the processes of \r\nlife, but there are a few simple, interacting factors that suppress \r\nrenewal. The accumulation of polyunsaturated fats, interacting with \r\na high concentration of oxygen, damages mitochondria, and causes a chronic \r\nexcessive exposure to cortisol. With mitochondrial damage, cells are \r\nunable to produce the progesterone needed to oppose cortisol and to \r\nprotect cells.Choosing \r\nthe right foods, the right atmosphere, the right mental and physical \r\nactivities, and finding the optimal rhythms of light, darkness, and \r\nactivity, can begin to alter the streaming renewal of cells in all the \r\norgans. Designing a more perfect environment is going to be much simpler \r\nthan the schemes of the genetic engineers.REFERENCESGrowth \r\n43, 58-61, 1979.The effect of progesterone on brain and body growth \r\nof chick embryos.G.

Many people are doing valid research \r\nrelating to cell renewal and regeneration, but its usefulness is seriously \r\nlimited by cultural and commercial constraints. By recovering some of \r\nour suppressed traditional culture, I think regenerative therapies can \r\nbe developed quickly, by identifying and eliminating as far as possible \r\nthe main factors that interfere with tissue renewal.Science \r\ngrew up in the highly authoritarian cultures of western Europe, and \r\neven as it contributed to cultural change, it kept an authoritarian \r\nmystique. Any culture functions as a system of definitions of reality \r\nand the limits of possibility, and to a great extent the \"laws \r\nof nature\" are decreed so that they will harmonize with the recognized \r\nlaws of society.The \r\npractical success of Newton's \"laws\" of motion when they were \r\napplied to ballistics and \"rocket science\" has led many people \r\nto value calculation, based on those laws, over evidence. In biology, \r\nthe idea that an organism is \"the information it contains in its \r\nDNA blueprint\" is an extention of this. The organism is turned \r\ninto something like a deductive expression of the law of DNA. This attitude \r\nhas been disastrous.The \r\nold feudal idea of a divine and stable social organization was applied \r\nby some people to their idea of biological organization, in which each \r\ncell (ruled by its nucleus) had its ordained place in the organism, \r\nwith the brain and the \"master gland,\" the pituitary, ruling \r\nthe subordinate organs, tissues, and cells. \"Anatomy\" was \r\ntaught from dead specimens, microscope slides, and illustrations in \r\nbooks. Most biologists' thoughts about cells in organisms reflect the \r\nstatic imagery of their instruction. (\"The histological image \r\nof these tissues actually reflects an instantaneous picture of cells \r\nin a continuous flux.\"Zajicek, 1981.)When \r\na person has playful and observant interactions with natural things, \r\nboth regularities and irregularities will be noticed, and in trying \r\nto understand those events, the richness of the experience will suggest \r\nan expansive range of possibilities. Perception and experimentation \r\nlead to understandings that are independent of culture and tradition.But \r\nthe mystique of science easily imposes itself, and distracts our attention \r\nfrom direct interactions with things. As we learn to operate lab instruments, \r\nwe are taught the kinds of results that can be expected, and the concepts \r\nthat will explain and predict the results of our operations. Science, \r\nas we learn about it in schools and the mass media, is mostly a set \r\nof catechisms.Our \r\ntheories about organisms inform our experiments with cells or tissues \r\nthat have been isolated from those organisms. The conditions for growing \r\ncells in dishes are thought of as \"physiological,\" in relation \r\nto the solution's \"physiological osmolarity,\" \"physiological \r\npH,\" nutrients, oxygenation, temperature, pressure, etc. But these \r\nconcepts of what is physiological derive from the monolithic ideology \r\nof the doctrinaire, and often fraudulent, mainstream of biological science.The \r\ncatechismic nature of science has led people to expect some \"break-throughs\" \r\n\r\nto occur in certain areas, and as authoritarian science has grown into \r\n\"big science\" managed by corporations and governments, those \r\nbreak-throughs are generally expected to be produced by the newest and \r\nmost expensive developments of \"high technology.\"But \r\nlooking closely at the real events and processes in the sciences in \r\nthe last couple of centuries, it turns out that useful advances have \r\nbeen produced mainly by breaking away from authoritarian doctrines, \r\nto return to common sense and relatively simple direct observations.Although \r\npeople were cloning animals in the 1960s, it was still widely taught \r\nthat it was impossible. The students of the professors who taught that \r\nit was impossible are now saying that it requires high technology and \r\nnew research.For \r\nthe last 100 years the most authoritative view in biology has been that \r\nthere are no stem cells in adults, that brains, hearts, pancreases and \r\noocytes are absolutely incapable of regeneration. But now, people seem \r\nto be finding stem cells wherever they look, but there is a mystique \r\nof high technology involved in finding and using them.Whether \r\nit's deliberate or not, the emphasis on stem cell technology has the \r\nfunction of directing attention away from traditional knowledge, the \r\nway allopathic medicine has de-emphasized the intrinsic ability of people \r\nto recover from disease.This \r\nresembles the way that the Mendel-Morgan gene doctrine was used to suppress \r\nthe knowledge gained from centuries of experience of plant and animal \r\nbreeders, and to belittle the discoveries of Luther Burbank, Paul Kammerer, \r\nTrofim Lysenko, and Barbara McClintock. The same type of biochemical \r\nprocess that caused the hereditary changes those researchers studied \r\nare involved in the differentiation and dedifferentiation of stem cells \r\nthat regulate healing and regeneration.In \r\nthe 1940s, even children discussed the biological discoveries of the \r\n1920s and 1930s, the work in regeneration and adaptation, parthenogenesis, \r\nand immortalization. The ideas of J. Loeb, T. Boveri, A. Gurwitsch, \r\nJ. Needham, C.M. Child, A. Carrel, et al., had become part of the general \r\nculture.But \r\nthat real biology was killed by a consortium of industry and government \r\nthat began a little before the second world war. In 1940, the government \r\nwas supporting research in chemical and biological warfare, and with \r\nthe Manhattan Project the role of government became so large that all \r\nof the major research universities were affected. Shortly after the \r\nwar, many researchers from the Manhattan Project were redeployed into \r\n\"molecular genetics,\" where the engineering attitude was applied \r\nto organisms.The \r\nsimplistic genetic dogmas were compatible with the reductionist engineering \r\napproach to the organism. The role of the government assured that the \r\nuniversities would subscribe to the basic scientific agenda. The atmosphere \r\nof that time was described by Carl Lindegren as \"The Cold War in \r\nBiology\" (1966).The \r\ndisappearance of the field concept in developmental biology was one \r\nof the strangest events in the history of science. It didn't just fade \r\naway, it was \"disappeared,\" in a massive undertaking of social \r\nengineering. In its absence, stem cells will seem to be a profitable \r\ntechnological marvel, rather than a universal life function, with a \r\ncentral role in everything we are and everything we do and can become.Many \r\npeople have tried to explain aging as a loss of cells, resulting from \r\nan intrinsic inability of any cell other than a germ cell to multiply \r\nmore than a certain number of times. More than 40 years ago Leonard \r\nHayflick popularized this doctrine in its most extreme form, saying \r\nthat no cell can divide more than 50 times unless it is converted into \r\na cancer cell. He and his followers claimed that they had explained \r\nwhy organisms must age and die. At the moment the ovum is fertilized, \r\nthe clock starts ticking for the essentially mortal somatic cells.In \r\n1970, it was being seriously proposed that memory was produced by the \r\ndeath of brain cells, in a manner analogous to the holes punched in \r\ncards to enter data into computers. The cultural dogma made it impossible \r\nto consider that learning could be associated with the birth of new \r\ncells in the adult brain.With \r\nthe announcement in 1997 of the cloning of the sheep Dolly from a somatic \r\ncell taken from a 6 year old sheep, there was renewed interest in the \r\nidea made famous by Alexis Carrel that all cells are potentially immortal, \r\nand in the possibility of preserving the vitality of human cells. Within \r\na few months, Hayflick began reminding the public that \"In the \r\nearly 1960's we overthrew this dogma after finding that normal cells \r\ndo have a finite replicative capacity.\" (\"During the first \r\nhalf of this century it was believed that because cultured normal cells \r\nwere immortal, aging must be caused by extra-cellular events.\") \r\nThe way Hayflick \"overthrew\" more than 35 years of work at \r\nthe Rockefeller Institute was by growing one type of cell, a lung fibroblast, \r\nin culture dishes, and finding that the cultures deteriorated quickly.To \r\ndraw global conclusions about an organism's development and aging from \r\nthe degenerative processes seen in a single type of cell, grown in isolation \r\nfrom all normal stimuli, would have been treated as nothing but wild \r\nspeculation, except that it occurred within a culture that needed it. \r\nNo aspect of Hayflick's cell culture system could properly be called \r\nphysiological.Other \r\nresearchers, simply by changing a single factor, caused great increases \r\nin the longevity of the cultured cells. Simply using a lower, more natural \r\noxygen concentration, the cells were able to undergo 20 more divisions. \r\nJust by adding niacin, 30 more divisions; vitamin E, 70 more divisions. \r\nExcess oxygen is a poison requiring constant adaptation.Hayflick \r\nalso published the observation that, while the cells kept in dishes \r\nat approximately body temperature deteriorated, cells kept frozen in \r\nliquid nitrogen didn't deteriorate, and he concluded that \"time\" \r\nwasn't the cause of aging. When I read his comments about the frozen \r\ncells, I wondered how anyone of normal intelligence could make such \r\nstupid statements. Since then, facts that came out because of the Freedom \r\nof Information Act, cause me to believe that a financial motive guided \r\nhis thoughts about his cultured fibroblasts.Hayflick \r\nand his followers have been attacking the idea of anti-aging medicine \r\nas quackery. But he is closely involved with the Geron corporation, \r\nwhich proposes that genetic alterations relating to telomeres may be \r\nable to cure cancer and prevent aging. Their claims were reported by \r\nCNN as \"Scientists discover cellular 'fountain of youth'.\"The \r\n\"wear and tear\" doctrine of aging that derived from the ideology \r\nof the gene was reinforced and renewed by Hayflick's cell culture observations, \r\nand it continued to rule the universities and popular culture.But \r\ndetailed investigation of skin cell growth showed that cells in the \r\nlower layer of the skin divide at least 10,000 times in a normal lifetime, \r\nand similar processes occur in the lining of the intestine. The endometrium \r\nand other highly renewable tissues just as obviously violated Hayflick's \r\nlimit. Transplantation experiments showed that pieces of mammary tissue \r\nor skin tissue could survive through ten normal lifetimes of experimental \r\nanimals without suffering the effects of aging.Even \r\nthe liver and adrenal gland are now known to be continuously renewed \r\nby \"cell streaming,\" though at a slower rate than the skin, \r\nconjunctiva, and intestine. Neurogenesis in the brain is now not only \r\nwidely accepted, it is even proposed as a mechanism to explain the therapeutic \r\neffects of antidepressants (Santarelli, et al., 2003).August \r\nWeismann's most influential doctrine said that \"somatic cells are \r\nmortal, only the germline cells are immortal,\" but he based the \r\ndoctrine on his mistaken belief that only the \"germline\" cells \r\ncontained all the genes of the organism. In 1885, to \"refute\" \r\nDarwin's belief that acquired traits could be inherited, he promulgated \r\nan absolute \"barrier\" between \"germline\" and \"soma,\" \r\n\r\nand invented facts to show that hereditary information can flow only \r\nfrom the germline to the somatic cells, and not the other direction. \r\nShortly after DNA became popular in the 1950s as \"the genetic material,\" \r\nWeismann's barrier was restated as the Central Dogma of molecular genetics, \r\nthat information flows only from DNA to RNA to protein, and never the \r\nother direction.It \r\nwas only in 2003, after the reality of cloning was widely recognized, \r\nthat a few experimenters began to investigate the origin of \"germline\" \r\ncells in the ovary, and to discover that they derive from somatic cells \r\n(Johnson, et al., 2004). With this discovery, the ancient knowledge \r\nthat a twig (klon, in Greek) cut from a tree could grow into \r\na whole tree, bearing fruit and viable seeds, was readmitted to general \r\nbiology, and the Weismann barrier was seen to be an illusion.Millions \r\nof people have \"explained\" female reproductive aging as the \r\nconsequence of the ovary \"running out of eggs.\" Innumerable \r\npublications purported to show the exact ways in which that process \r\noccurs, following the Weismann doctrine. But now that it is clear that \r\nadult ovaries can give birth to new oocytes, a new explanation for female \r\nreproductive aging is needed. It is likely that the same factors that \r\ncause female reproductive aging also cause aging of other systems and \r\norgans and tissues, and that those factors are extrinsic to the cells \r\nthemselves, as Alexis Carrel and others demonstrated long ago. This \r\nis a way of saying that all cells are potential stem cells. The \"niche\" \r\n\r\nin which new cells are born in the streaming organism, and the processes \r\nby which damaged cells are removed, are physiological issues that can \r\nbe illuminated by the idea of a morphogenetic field.When \r\nthe post-war genetic engineers took over biological research, the idea \r\nof a biophysical field was totally abandoned, but after about 15 years, \r\nit became necessary to think of problems beyond those existing within \r\na single bacterium, namely, the problem of how an ovum becomes and embryo. \r\nFrancis Crick, of DNA fame, who was educated as a physicist, revived \r\n(without a meaningful historical context) the idea of a diffusion gradient \r\nas a simple integrating factor that wouldn't be too offensive to the \r\nreductionists. But for events far beyond the scale of the egg's internal \r\nstructure, for example to explain how a nerve axon can travel a very \r\nlong distance to innervate exactly the right kind of cell, the diffusion \r\nof molecules loses its simplicity and plausibility. (Early in the history \r\nof experimental embryology, it was observed that electrical fields affect \r\nthe direction of growth of nerve fibers.)C. \r\nM. Child saw a gradient of metabolic activity as an essential component \r\nof the morphogenetic field. This kind of gradient doesn't deny the existence \r\nof diffusion gradients, or other physical components of a field. Electrical \r\nand osmotic (and electro-osmotic) events are generated by metabolism, \r\nand affect other factors, including pH, oxidation and reduction, cell \r\nmotility and cell shape, ionic selectivity and other types of cellular \r\nselectivity and specificity. Gradients of DNA methylation exist, and \r\naffect the expression of inherited information.Methylation \r\ndecreases the expression of particular genes, and during the differention \r\nof cells in the development of an embryo, genes are methylated and demethylated \r\nas the cell adapts to produce the proteins that are involved in the \r\nstructure and function of a particular tissue. Methylation (which increases \r\na molecule's affinity for fats) is a widespread process in cells, and \r\nfor example regulates cellular excitability. It is affected by diet \r\nand a variety of stresses.DNA \r\nmethylation patterns are normally fairly stable, and can help to account \r\nfor the transgenerational transmission of acquired adaptations, and \r\nfor neonatal imprinting that can last a lifetime. But with injury, stress, \r\nand aging, the methylation patterns of differentiated tissues can be \r\nchanged, contributing to the development of tumors, or to the loss of \r\ncellular functions. Even learning can change the methylation of specific \r\ngenes. Duringin vitroculture, the enzymes of gene methylation \r\nare known to be increased, relative to their normal activity (Wang, \r\net al., 2005).The \r\nphenomenon of \"gene\" methylation in response to environmental \r\nand metabolic conditions may eventually lead to the extinction of the \r\ndoctrine that \"cells are controlled by their genes.\"During \r\nsuccessful adaptation to stress, cells make adjustments to their metabolic \r\nsystems (for example with a holistic change of the degree of phosphorylation, \r\nwhich increases molecules' affinity for water), and their metabolic \r\nprocesses can contribute to changes in their state of differentiation. \r\nSome changes may lead to successful adaptation (for example by producing \r\nbiogenic stimulators that stimulate cell functioning and regeneration), \r\nothers to failed adaptation. Even the decomposition of cells can release \r\nsubstances that contribute to the adaptation of surrounding cells, for \r\nexample when sphingosines stimulate the production of stem cells.DNA \r\nmethylation is just one relatively stable event that occurs in relation \r\nto a metabolic field.  Modifications of histones (regulatory proteins \r\nin chromosomes, which are acetylated as well as methylated) and structural-contractile \r\nfilaments also contribute to the differentiation of cells, but the pattern \r\nof DNA methylation seems to guide the methylation of histones and the \r\nstructure of the chromosomes (Nan, et al., 1998).Steroids \r\nand phospholipids, neurotransmitters and endorphins, ATP, GTP, other \r\nphosphates, retinoids, NO and CO2--many materials and processes participate \r\nin the coherence of the living state, the living substance. Carbon dioxide, \r\nfor example, by binding to lysine amino groups in the histones, will \r\ninfluence their methylation.  Carbon dioxide is likely to affect \r\nother amino groups in the chromosomes.The \r\nnumber and arrangement of mitochondria is an important factor in producing \r\nand maintaining the metabolic gradients. Things that decrease mitochondrial \r\nenergy production--nitric oxide, histamine, cytokines, cortisol--increase \r\nDNA methylation. Decreased gene expression is associated with reduced \r\nrespiratory energy. It seems reasonable to guess that increased gene \r\nexpression would demand increased availability of energy.As \r\nan ovum differentiates into an organism, cells become progressively \r\nmore specialized, inhibiting the expression of many genes. Less energy \r\nis needed by stably functioning cells, than by actively adapting cells. \r\nA.I. Zotin described the process of maturing and differentiating as \r\na decrease of entropy, an increase of order accompanying a decreased \r\nenergy expenditure. The entropic egg develops into a less entropic embryo \r\nwith a great expenditure of energy.The \r\npartially differentiated stem cell doesn't go through all the stages \r\nof development, but it does expend energy intensely as it matures.The \r\nrestoration of energy is one requirement for the activation of regeneration. \r\nWhen a hormone such as noradrenaline or insulin causes a stem cell to \r\ndifferentiate in vitro, it causes new mitochondria to form. This is \r\nsomewhat analogous to the insertion of mitochondria into the ripening \r\noocyte, by the nurse cells that surround it. The conditionally decreased \r\nentropy of maturation is reversed, and when sufficient respiratory energy \r\nis available, the renewed and refreshed cell will be able to renew an \r\nappropriate degree of differentiation.When \r\nsimple organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, or protozoa are stressed, \r\nfor example by the absence of nutrients or the presence of toxins, they \r\nslow their metabolism, and suppress the expression of genes, increasing \r\nthe methylation of DNA, to form resistant and quiescent spores. Our \r\ndifferentiated state doesn't go to the metabolic extreme seen in sporulation, \r\nbut it's useful to look at maturity and aging in this context, because \r\nit suggests that the wrong kind of stress decreases the ability of the \r\norganism to adapt, by processes resembling those in the spore-forming \r\norganisms.Charles \r\nVacanti, who has grown cartilage from cells taken from 100 year old \r\nhuman cartilage, believes our tissues contain \"spore cells,\" \r\nvery small cells with slow metabolism and extreme resistance to heat, \r\ncold, and starvation.If \r\nthe slowed metabolism of aging, like that of sporulating cells, is produced \r\nby a certain kind of stress that lowers cellular energy and functions, \r\nit might be useful to think of the other stages of the stress reaction \r\nin relation to the production of stem cells. Selye divided stress into \r\na first stage of shock, followed by a prolonged adaptation, which could \r\nsometimes end in exhaustion. If the maturity of differentiated functioning \r\nis equivalent to the adaptation phase, and cellular decline and disintegration \r\nis the exhaustion phase, then the shock-like reaction would correspond \r\nto the birth of new stem cells.Selye \r\ndescribed estrogen's effects as equivalent to the shock-phase of stress. \r\nEstrogen's basic action is to make oxygen unavailable, lowering the \r\noxygen tension of the tissues, locally and temporarily. Like nitric \r\noxide, which is produced by estrogenic stimulation, estrogen interferes \r\nwith energy production, so if its stimulation is prolonged, cells are \r\ndamaged or killed, rather than being stimulated to regenerate.Extrinsic \r\nfactors elicit renewal, the way stress can elicit adaptation. While \r\naging cells can't use the oxygen that is present, a scarcity of oxygen \r\ncan serve as a stimulus to maximize the respiratory systems. Brief oxygen \r\ndeprivation excites a cell, causes it to swell, and to begin to divide.Oxygen \r\ndeprivation, as in the normally hypoxic bone marrow, stimulates the \r\nformation of stem cells, as well as the biogenesis of mitochondria. \r\nAs the newly formed cells, with abundant mitochondria, get adequate \r\noxygen, they begin differentiation.Form, \r\nbased on cellular differentiation, follows function--a vein transplanted \r\ninto an artery develops anatomically into an artery, a colon attached \r\ndirectly to the anus becomes a new rectum with its appropriate innervation, \r\na broken bone restructures to form a normal bone. If the bladder is \r\nforced to function more than normal, by artificially keeping it filled, \r\nits thin wall of smooth muscle develops into a thick wall of striated \r\nmuscle that rhythmically contracts, like the heart. If a tadpole is \r\ngiven a vegetarian diet, the absorptive surface of its digestive system \r\nwill develop to be twice the size of those that are fed meat. Pressure, \r\nstretching, and pulsation are among the signals that guide cells' differentiation.Very \r\nearly in the study of embryology it was noticed that the presence of \r\none tissue sometimes induced the differentiation of another kind, and \r\nalso that there were factors in embryonic tissues that would stimulate \r\ncell division generally, and others that could inhibit the growth of \r\na particular tissue type. Diffusable substances and light were among \r\nthe factors identified as growth regulators.Extracts \r\nof particular tissues were found to suppress the multiplication of cells \r\nin that type of tissue, in adult animals as well as in embryos. In the \r\n1960s, the tissue-specific inhibitors were called chalones.The \r\nbrain's development is governed by the presence in the organism of the \r\nbody part to which it corresponds, such as the eyes or legs. The number \r\nof cells in a particular part of the nervous system is governed by the \r\nquantity of nervous input, sensory or motor, that it receives. An enriched \r\nenvironment causes a bigger brain to grow. Sensory nerve stimulation \r\nof a particular region of the brain causes nerve cells to migrate to \r\nthat area (a process called neurobiotaxis; deBeers, 1927), but nerve \r\nstimulation also causes mitochondria to accumulate in stimulated areas. \r\nNerve activity has a trophic, sustaining influence on other organs, \r\nas well as on the brain. Nerve stimulation, like mechanical pressure \r\nor stretching, is an important signal for cellular differentiation.When \r\nstem cells or progenitor cells are called on to replace cells in an \r\norgan, they are said to be \"recruited\" by that organ, or to \r\n\"home\" to that organ, if they are coming from elsewhere. Traditionally, \r\nthe bone marrow has been considered to be the source of circulating \r\nstem cells, but it now appears that a variety of other less differentiated \r\ncells can be recruited when needed. Cells from the blood can repair \r\nthe endothelium of blood vessels, and endothelial cells can become mesenchymal \r\ncells, in the heart, for example.The \r\nstandard doctrine about cancer is that a tumor derives from a single \r\nmutant cell, but it has been known for a long time that different types \r\nof cell, such as phagocytes and mast cells, usually reside in tumors, \r\nand it is now becoming clear that tumors recruit cells, including apparently \r\nnormal cells, from other parts of the same organ. For example, a brain \r\ntumor of glial cells, a glioma, recruits glial cells from surrounding \r\nareas of the brain, in a process that's analogous to the embryological \r\nmovement of nerve cells to a center of excitation. Each tumor, in a \r\nsense, seems to be a center of excitation, and its fate seems to depend \r\non the nature of the cells that respond to its signals.To \r\naccommodate some of the newer facts about tumors, the cancer establishment \r\nhas begun speaking of \"the cancer stem cell\" as the real villain, \r\nthe origin of the tumor, while the bulk of the tumor is seen to be made \r\nup of defective cells that have a short life-span. But if we recognize \r\nthat tumors are recruiting cells from beyond their boundaries, this \r\nprocess would account for the growth and survival of a tumor even while \r\nmost of its cells are inert and dying, without invoking the invisible \r\ncancer stem cell. And this view, that it is the field which is defective \r\nrather than the cell, is consistent with the evidence which has been \r\naccumulating for 35 years that tumor cells, given the right environment, \r\ncan differentiate into healthy cells. (Hendrix, et al., 2007)Simply \r\nstretching an organ (Woo, et al., 2007) is stimulus enough to cause \r\nit to recruit cells from the bloodstream, and will probably stimulate \r\nmultiplication in its local resident cells, too. Every \"cancer \r\nfield\" probably begins as a healing process, and generally the \r\nhealing and regeneration are at least partially successful.When \r\nan organ--the brain, heart, liver, or a blood vessel--is inflamed or \r\nsuffering from an insufficient blood supply, stem cells introduced into \r\nthe blood will migrate specifically to that organ.Organ \r\nspecific materials (chalones) are known to circulate in the blood, inhibiting \r\ncell division in cells typical to that organ, but it also seems that \r\norgan specific materials are secreted by a damaged organ, that help \r\nto prepare stem cells for their migration into that organ. When undifferentiated \r\ncells are cultured with serum from a person with liver failure, they \r\nbegin to differentiate into liver cells.It \r\nis still common to speak of each organ as having a \"clonal origin\" \r\nin the differentiating embryo, as a simple expansion of a certain embryonic \r\nanlage. The implication of this way of thinking is that differentiation \r\nisdeterminationin an irreversible sense. This is another case \r\nof medical ideas being based on images of fixed histological material. \r\nNormal cells, including nerve and muscle cells, can change type, with \r\nconnective tissue cells becoming nerve cells, nerve cells becoming muscle \r\nand fiber cells, fat, fiber, and muscle cells redifferentiating, for \r\nexample.Cell \r\nmovements in solid tissues aren't limited to the short distances between \r\ncapillaries and the tissues nourished by those capillaries, rather, \r\ncells can migrate much greater distances, without entering the bloodstream. \r\nThe speed of a single cell moving by ameboid motion can be measured \r\nby watching cells on a glass slide as they move toward food, or by watching \r\ncells of the slime mold Dictyostelium when they are aggregating, or \r\nby watching the pigment cells in and around moles or melanomas, under \r\nthe influence of hormones. At body temperature, a single cell can crawl \r\nabout an inch per day. Waves or spots of brown pigment can be seen migrating \r\nthrough the skin away from a mole, preceding the disintegration of the \r\nmole under the influence of progesterone or DHEA. Under ordinary conditions, \r\npigment cells can sometimes be seen migrating into depigmented areas \r\nof skin, during the recovery of an area affected by vitiligo. These \r\norganized movements of masses of cells happen to be easy to see, but \r\nthere is evidence that other types of cell can reconstruct tissues by \r\ntheir ameboid movements, when circumstances are right. Tumors or tissue \r\nabnormalities can appear or disappear with a suddenness that seems impossible \r\nto people who have studied only fixed tissue preparations.Stimulation \r\nis anabolic, building tissue, when the organism is adapting to the stimulation. \r\nUnused structures in cells and tissues are always being recycled by \r\nmetabolic processes. When tissues are injured and become unable to function, \r\nsome of their substances stimulate the growth of replacement cells.Some \r\ntypes of injury or irritation can activate regenerative processes. A \r\ndermatology journal described the case of an old man who had been bald \r\nfor many years who fell head-first into his fireplace. As his burned \r\nscalp healed, new hair grew. In the U.S., experimenters (Ito, et al., \r\n2007) have found that injuring the skin of mice stimulates the formation \r\nof stem cells that are able to become hair follicle cells, supporting \r\nthe regeneration of cells that had been absent. A brief exposure to \r\nestrogen, and other stress related signals (nitric oxide, endorphin, \r\nprostaglandins) can initiate stem cell proliferation.In \r\nthe years after the first world war, Vladimir Filatov, who developed \r\ntechniques of reconstructive surgery, including corneal transplants, \r\nfound that cold storage of tissues (for example, corneas from cadavers) \r\ncaused them to function better than fresh tissues, and he found that \r\nthese stressed tissues would often spread a healing influence out into \r\nthe surrounding tissues. Extracts of stressed tissues produced similar \r\neffects.L.V. \r\nPolezhaev began studying the regenerative capacities of mammals in the \r\nlate 1940s, and his work showed that processes similar to embryonic \r\ninduction are involved in the organism's responses to damaged tissues. \r\nFor example, when a piece of killed muscle tissue is enclosed in a capsule \r\n(\"diffusion chamber\") that permits molecules, but no cells, \r\nto diffuse through it, and implanted subcutaneously, it had no inductive \r\neffect on surrounding cells. But when the pores of the capsule allowed \r\ncells to enter, skeletal muscle formed where the dead tissue had been, \r\nand tissue resembling heart muscle formed outside the capsule. Phagocytosis \r\nhad been essential for the induction to occur.Macrophages \r\nare ordinarily thought of as \"antigen-presenting cells\" that \r\nhelp to activate the specific immune responses. But apparently phagocytosis \r\nis involved in the replacement of damaged tissues, by recruiting or \r\ninducing the differentiation of replacement cells. The phagocytosis \r\nfunction isn't limited to the blood cells commonly called phagocytes; \r\neven nerve cells can ingest particles and fragments of damaged tissues.Many \r\nfactors regulate the process of phagocytosis. Stress and lipid peroxidation \r\ndecrease phagocytosis (Izgüt-Uysal, et al., 2004), and also damage \r\nmitochondria and inhibit cell renewal.Unsaturated \r\nfatty acids inhibit phagocytosis (Guimaraes, et al., 1991, 1992; Costa \r\nRosa, et al., 1996; Virella, et al., 1989; Akamatsu, et al., 1990), \r\nand suppress mitochondrial function (Gomes, et al., 2006).  Dietary \r\nrestriction activates phagocytosis (Moriguchi, et al., 1989), suggesting \r\nthat normal diets contain suppressive materials.Subnormal \r\ntemperatures cause a shift from phagocytosis to inflammation. Light, \r\nespecially the red light which penetrates easily into tissues, activates \r\nthe formation of new cells as well as their differentiation. It affects \r\nenergy production, increasing the formation of mitochondria, and the \r\nactivity of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes. Red light accelerates \r\nwound healing, and improves the quality of the scar, reducing the amount \r\nof fibrosis. The daily cycling between darkness and light is probably \r\nan important factor in regulating the birth and differentiation of cells.Darkness \r\nsuppresses mitochondrial function, and light activates it. Prolonged \r\ndarkness increases cortisol, and cortisol (which makes cells more susceptible \r\nto excitotoxic death) inhibits stem cell proliferation (Li, et al., \r\n2006; Liu, et al., 2003). Neurogenesis is suppressed by stress, and \r\nincreased by spontaneous activity, and has a circadian rhythm. Aging \r\nand depression both involve a diminished ability to rhythmically lower \r\nthe production of cortisol. Cell renewal requires a rhythmic decrease \r\nin the exposure to cortisol..In \r\nthe spring, with increased day length, the brains of song-birds grow, \r\nwith an increased proliferation of cells in the part of the brain involved \r\nin singing. The production of progesterone increases in most animals \r\nin the spring, and it is the main hormone responsible for the birds' \r\nbrain growth.Progesterone \r\nand its metabolites protect brain cells against injury, and improve \r\nthe brain's ability to recover after traumatic injury (Brinton and Wang, \r\n2006). In the 1960s, Marion Diamond's group showed that environmental \r\nenrichment, or progesterone, caused brains to grow larger, and that \r\nthese changes were passed on to descendants in a cumulative, increasing \r\nway. This suggests that the factors that promote neurogenesis also cause \r\nchanges in the apparatus of reproduction and inheritance, that support \r\nthe development of the brain--probably including the methylation system, \r\nwhich is involved in regulating genes, and also mood and behavior.Women's \r\nmonthly cycles, in which a brief estrogen dominance is followed by sustained \r\nexposure to progesterone, are probably an important factor in the renewal \r\nof the cells of the brain and other organs, as well as those of the \r\nreproductive organs. The daily rhythms of hormones and metabolism are \r\nknown to be involved in the regulation of cell renewal.Environmental \r\nenrichment, learning, high altitude, and thyroid hormone promote the \r\nformation of new mitochondria, and stimulate stem cell proliferation. \r\nAt least in some laboratories, 20% oxygen, approximately the amount \r\nas in the atmosphere, suppresses the proliferation of stem cells (He, \r\net al., 2007). This was the unphysiologically high concentration of \r\noxygen used in Hayflick's cell cultures. At high altitudes, where tissues \r\nare exposed to less oxygen, and more carbon dioxide, there is a lower \r\nincidence of all the degenerative diseases, including cancer, heart \r\ndisease, and dementia. Improved cellular energy production and more \r\nactive renewal of cells would probably account for those differences.For \r\nCrick, the idea of a diffusion gradient to explain embryonic development \r\nwas simply an extension of his reductionist orientation, in which diffusing \r\nmolecules induced or inhibited bacterial genes, and in which genes controlled \r\ncells. For people with that orientation, the adaptive mutations described \r\nby Carl Lindegren, and later by John Cairns, or even the stress-induced \r\nvariability described by Lysenko, Strong, and McClintock, were heretical. \r\nPolezhaev's demonstration that cells could do something that molecular \r\ndiffusion didn't do, threatened to take biology away from the reductionists. \r\nIf the organism's adaptation to the environment involves changing its \r\nown genes, Crick's paradigm fails.Crick's \r\nCentral Dogma, derived from the ideology that produced Weismann's Barrier, \r\nhas been invoked by generations of professors who wanted to deny the \r\npossibility of adaptive tissue renewal and regeneration. Without the \r\ndogma, new ideas about aging and disease will be needed. If somatic \r\ncells can adjust their genes, and if they can also differentiate into \r\nnew eggs and sperms, new ideas about inheritance of acquired traits \r\nwill be needed.The \r\nreplacement of injured cells means that mutations need not accumulate. \r\nCell renewal with elimination of mutant cells has been observed in sun-damaged \r\nskin simply by stopping the damage, and mitochondria with damaged DNA \r\ncan be replaced by healthy mitochondria simply by doing the right kind \r\nof exercise.The \r\nregulation of cell renewal probably involves all of the processes of \r\nlife, but there are a few simple, interacting factors that suppress \r\nrenewal. The accumulation of polyunsaturated fats, interacting with \r\na high concentration of oxygen, damages mitochondria, and causes a chronic \r\nexcessive exposure to cortisol. With mitochondrial damage, cells are \r\nunable to produce the progesterone needed to oppose cortisol and to \r\nprotect cells.Choosing \r\nthe right foods, the right atmosphere, the right mental and physical \r\nactivities, and finding the optimal rhythms of light, darkness, and \r\nactivity, can begin to alter the streaming renewal of cells in all the \r\norgans. Designing a more perfect environment is going to be much simpler \r\nthan the schemes of the genetic engineers.REFERENCESGrowth \r\n43, 58-61, 1979.The effect of progesterone on brain and body growth \r\nof chick embryos.G.

Many people are doing valid research \r\nrelating to cell renewal and regeneration, but its usefulness is seriously \r\nlimited by cultural and commercial constraints. By recovering some of \r\nour suppressed traditional culture, I think regenerative therapies can \r\nbe developed quickly, by identifying and eliminating as far as possible \r\nthe main factors that interfere with tissue renewal.Science \r\ngrew up in the highly authoritarian cultures of western Europe, and \r\neven as it contributed to cultural change, it kept an authoritarian \r\nmystique. Any culture functions as a system of definitions of reality \r\nand the limits of possibility, and to a great extent the \"laws \r\nof nature\" are decreed so that they will harmonize with the recognized \r\nlaws of society.The \r\npractical success of Newton's \"laws\" of motion when they were \r\napplied to ballistics and \"rocket science\" has led many people \r\nto value calculation, based on those laws, over evidence. In biology, \r\nthe idea that an organism is \"the information it contains in its \r\nDNA blueprint\" is an extention of this. The organism is turned \r\ninto something like a deductive expression of the law of DNA. This attitude \r\nhas been disastrous.The \r\nold feudal idea of a divine and stable social organization was applied \r\nby some people to their idea of biological organization, in which each \r\ncell (ruled by its nucleus) had its ordained place in the organism, \r\nwith the brain and the \"master gland,\" the pituitary, ruling \r\nthe subordinate organs, tissues, and cells. \"Anatomy\" was \r\ntaught from dead specimens, microscope slides, and illustrations in \r\nbooks. Most biologists' thoughts about cells in organisms reflect the \r\nstatic imagery of their instruction. (\"The histological image \r\nof these tissues actually reflects an instantaneous picture of cells \r\nin a continuous flux.\"Zajicek, 1981.)When \r\na person has playful and observant interactions with natural things, \r\nboth regularities and irregularities will be noticed, and in trying \r\nto understand those events, the richness of the experience will suggest \r\nan expansive range of possibilities. Perception and experimentation \r\nlead to understandings that are independent of culture and tradition.But \r\nthe mystique of science easily imposes itself, and distracts our attention \r\nfrom direct interactions with things. As we learn to operate lab instruments, \r\nwe are taught the kinds of results that can be expected, and the concepts \r\nthat will explain and predict the results of our operations. Science, \r\nas we learn about it in schools and the mass media, is mostly a set \r\nof catechisms.Our \r\ntheories about organisms inform our experiments with cells or tissues \r\nthat have been isolated from those organisms. The conditions for growing \r\ncells in dishes are thought of as \"physiological,\" in relation \r\nto the solution's \"physiological osmolarity,\" \"physiological \r\npH,\" nutrients, oxygenation, temperature, pressure, etc. But these \r\nconcepts of what is physiological derive from the monolithic ideology \r\nof the doctrinaire, and often fraudulent, mainstream of biological science.The \r\ncatechismic nature of science has led people to expect some \"break-throughs\" \r\nto occur in certain areas, and as authoritarian science has grown into \r\n\"big science\" managed by corporations and governments, those \r\nbreak-throughs are generally expected to be produced by the newest and \r\nmost expensive developments of \"high technology.\"But \r\nlooking closely at the real events and processes in the sciences in \r\nthe last couple of centuries, it turns out that useful advances have \r\nbeen produced mainly by breaking away from authoritarian doctrines, \r\nto return to common sense and relatively simple direct observations.Although \r\npeople were cloning animals in the 1960s, it was still widely taught \r\nthat it was impossible. The students of the professors who taught that \r\nit was impossible are now saying that it requires high technology and \r\nnew research.For \r\nthe last 100 years the most authoritative view in biology has been that \r\nthere are no stem cells in adults, that brains, hearts, pancreases and \r\noocytes are absolutely incapable of regeneration. But now, people seem \r\nto be finding stem cells wherever they look, but there is a mystique \r\nof high technology involved in finding and using them.Whether \r\nit's deliberate or not, the emphasis on stem cell technology has the \r\nfunction of directing attention away from traditional knowledge, the \r\nway allopathic medicine has de-emphasized the intrinsic ability of people \r\nto recover from disease.This \r\nresembles the way that the Mendel-Morgan gene doctrine was used to suppress \r\nthe knowledge gained from centuries of experience of plant and animal \r\nbreeders, and to belittle the discoveries of Luther Burbank, Paul Kammerer, \r\nTrofim Lysenko, and Barbara McClintock. The same type of biochemical \r\nprocess that caused the hereditary changes those researchers studied \r\nare involved in the differentiation and dedifferentiation of stem cells \r\nthat regulate healing and regeneration.In \r\nthe 1940s, even children discussed the biological discoveries of the \r\n1920s and 1930s, the work in regeneration and adaptation, parthenogenesis, \r\nand immortalization. The ideas of J. Loeb, T. Boveri, A. Gurwitsch, \r\nJ. Needham, C.M. Child, A. Carrel, et al., had become part of the general \r\nculture.But \r\nthat real biology was killed by a consortium of industry and government \r\nthat began a little before the second world war. In 1940, the government \r\nwas supporting research in chemical and biological warfare, and with \r\nthe Manhattan Project the role of government became so large that all \r\nof the major research universities were affected. Shortly after the \r\nwar, many researchers from the Manhattan Project were redeployed into \r\n\"molecular genetics,\" where the engineering attitude was applied \r\nto organisms.The \r\nsimplistic genetic dogmas were compatible with the reductionist engineering \r\napproach to the organism. The role of the government assured that the \r\nuniversities would subscribe to the basic scientific agenda. The atmosphere \r\nof that time was described by Carl Lindegren as \"The Cold War in \r\nBiology\" (1966).The \r\ndisappearance of the field concept in developmental biology was one \r\nof the strangest events in the history of science. It didn't just fade \r\naway, it was \"disappeared,\" in a massive undertaking of social \r\nengineering. In its absence, stem cells will seem to be a profitable \r\ntechnological marvel, rather than a universal life function, with a \r\ncentral role in everything we are and everything we do and can become.Many \r\npeople have tried to explain aging as a loss of cells, resulting from \r\nan intrinsic inability of any cell other than a germ cell to multiply \r\nmore than a certain number of times. More than 40 years ago Leonard \r\nHayflick popularized this doctrine in its most extreme form, saying \r\nthat no cell can divide more than 50 times unless it is converted into \r\na cancer cell. He and his followers claimed that they had explained \r\nwhy organisms must age and die. At the moment the ovum is fertilized, \r\nthe clock starts ticking for the essentially mortal somatic cells.In \r\n1970, it was being seriously proposed that memory was produced by the \r\ndeath of brain cells, in a manner analogous to the holes punched in \r\ncards to enter data into computers. The cultural dogma made it impossible \r\nto consider that learning could be associated with the birth of new \r\ncells in the adult brain.With \r\nthe announcement in 1997 of the cloning of the sheep Dolly from a somatic \r\ncell taken from a 6 year old sheep, there was renewed interest in the \r\nidea made famous by Alexis Carrel that all cells are potentially immortal, \r\nand in the possibility of preserving the vitality of human cells. Within \r\na few months, Hayflick began reminding the public that \"In the \r\nearly 1960's we overthrew this dogma after finding that normal cells \r\ndo have a finite replicative capacity.\" (\"During the first \r\nhalf of this century it was believed that because cultured normal cells \r\nwere immortal, aging must be caused by extra-cellular events.\") \r\nThe way Hayflick \"overthrew\" more than 35 years of work at \r\nthe Rockefeller Institute was by growing one type of cell, a lung fibroblast, \r\nin culture dishes, and finding that the cultures deteriorated quickly.To \r\ndraw global conclusions about an organism's development and aging from \r\nthe degenerative processes seen in a single type of cell, grown in isolation \r\nfrom all normal stimuli, would have been treated as nothing but wild \r\nspeculation, except that it occurred within a culture that needed it. \r\nNo aspect of Hayflick's cell culture system could properly be called \r\nphysiological.Other \r\nresearchers, simply by changing a single factor, caused great increases \r\nin the longevity of the cultured cells. Simply using a lower, more natural \r\noxygen concentration, the cells were able to undergo 20 more divisions. \r\nJust by adding niacin, 30 more divisions; vitamin E, 70 more divisions. \r\nExcess oxygen is a poison requiring constant adaptation.Hayflick \r\nalso published the observation that, while the cells kept in dishes \r\nat approximately body temperature deteriorated, cells kept frozen in \r\nliquid nitrogen didn't deteriorate, and he concluded that \"time\" \r\nwasn't the cause of aging. When I read his comments about the frozen \r\ncells, I wondered how anyone of normal intelligence could make such \r\nstupid statements. Since then, facts that came out because of the Freedom \r\nof Information Act, cause me to believe that a financial motive guided \r\nhis thoughts about his cultured fibroblasts.Hayflick \r\nand his followers have been attacking the idea of anti-aging medicine \r\nas quackery. But he is closely involved with the Geron corporation, \r\nwhich proposes that genetic alterations relating to telomeres may be \r\nable to cure cancer and prevent aging. Their claims were reported by \r\nCNN as \"Scientists discover cellular 'fountain of youth'.\"The \r\n\"wear and tear\" doctrine of aging that derived from the ideology \r\nof the gene was reinforced and renewed by Hayflick's cell culture observations, \r\nand it continued to rule the universities and popular culture.But \r\ndetailed investigation of skin cell growth showed that cells in the \r\nlower layer of the skin divide at least 10,000 times in a normal lifetime, \r\nand similar processes occur in the lining of the intestine. The endometrium \r\nand other highly renewable tissues just as obviously violated Hayflick's \r\nlimit. Transplantation experiments showed that pieces of mammary tissue \r\nor skin tissue could survive through ten normal lifetimes of experimental \r\nanimals without suffering the effects of aging.Even \r\nthe liver and adrenal gland are now known to be continuously renewed \r\nby \"cell streaming,\" though at a slower rate than the skin, \r\nconjunctiva, and intestine. Neurogenesis in the brain is now not only \r\nwidely accepted, it is even proposed as a mechanism to explain the therapeutic \r\neffects of antidepressants (Santarelli, et al., 2003).August \r\nWeismann's most influential doctrine said that \"somatic cells are \r\nmortal, only the germline cells are immortal,\" but he based the \r\ndoctrine on his mistaken belief that only the \"germline\" cells \r\ncontained all the genes of the organism. In 1885, to \"refute\" \r\nDarwin's belief that acquired traits could be inherited, he promulgated \r\nan absolute \"barrier\" between \"germline\" and \"soma,\" \r\n\r\nand invented facts to show that hereditary information can flow only \r\nfrom the germline to the somatic cells, and not the other direction. \r\nShortly after DNA became popular in the 1950s as \"the genetic material,\" \r\nWeismann's barrier was restated as the Central Dogma of molecular genetics, \r\nthat information flows only from DNA to RNA to protein, and never the \r\nother direction.It \r\nwas only in 2003, after the reality of cloning was widely recognized, \r\nthat a few experimenters began to investigate the origin of \"germline\" \r\ncells in the ovary, and to discover that they derive from somatic cells \r\n(Johnson, et al., 2004). With this discovery, the ancient knowledge \r\nthat a twig (klon, in Greek) cut from a tree could grow into \r\na whole tree, bearing fruit and viable seeds, was readmitted to general \r\nbiology, and the Weismann barrier was seen to be an illusion.Millions \r\nof people have \"explained\" female reproductive aging as the \r\nconsequence of the ovary \"running out of eggs.\" Innumerable \r\npublications purported to show the exact ways in which that process \r\noccurs, following the Weismann doctrine. But now that it is clear that \r\nadult ovaries can give birth to new oocytes, a new explanation for female \r\nreproductive aging is needed. It is likely that the same factors that \r\ncause female reproductive aging also cause aging of other systems and \r\norgans and tissues, and that those factors are extrinsic to the cells \r\nthemselves, as Alexis Carrel and others demonstrated long ago. This \r\nis a way of saying that all cells are potential stem cells. The \"niche\" \r\n\r\nin which new cells are born in the streaming organism, and the processes \r\nby which damaged cells are removed, are physiological issues that can \r\nbe illuminated by the idea of a morphogenetic field.When \r\nthe post-war genetic engineers took over biological research, the idea \r\nof a biophysical field was totally abandoned, but after about 15 years, \r\nit became necessary to think of problems beyond those existing within \r\na single bacterium, namely, the problem of how an ovum becomes and embryo. \r\nFrancis Crick, of DNA fame, who was educated as a physicist, revived \r\n(without a meaningful historical context) the idea of a diffusion gradient \r\nas a simple integrating factor that wouldn't be too offensive to the \r\nreductionists. But for events far beyond the scale of the egg's internal \r\nstructure, for example to explain how a nerve axon can travel a very \r\nlong distance to innervate exactly the right kind of cell, the diffusion \r\nof molecules loses its simplicity and plausibility. (Early in the history \r\nof experimental embryology, it was observed that electrical fields affect \r\nthe direction of growth of nerve fibers.)C. \r\nM. Child saw a gradient of metabolic activity as an essential component \r\nof the morphogenetic field. This kind of gradient doesn't deny the existence \r\nof diffusion gradients, or other physical components of a field. Electrical \r\nand osmotic (and electro-osmotic) events are generated by metabolism, \r\nand affect other factors, including pH, oxidation and reduction, cell \r\nmotility and cell shape, ionic selectivity and other types of cellular \r\nselectivity and specificity. Gradients of DNA methylation exist, and \r\naffect the expression of inherited information.Methylation \r\ndecreases the expression of particular genes, and during the differention \r\nof cells in the development of an embryo, genes are methylated and demethylated \r\nas the cell adapts to produce the proteins that are involved in the \r\nstructure and function of a particular tissue. Methylation (which increases \r\na molecule's affinity for fats) is a widespread process in cells, and \r\nfor example regulates cellular excitability. It is affected by diet \r\nand a variety of stresses.DNA \r\nmethylation patterns are normally fairly stable, and can help to account \r\nfor the transgenerational transmission of acquired adaptations, and \r\nfor neonatal imprinting that can last a lifetime. But with injury, stress, \r\nand aging, the methylation patterns of differentiated tissues can be \r\nchanged, contributing to the development of tumors, or to the loss of \r\ncellular functions. Even learning can change the methylation of specific \r\ngenes. Duringin vitroculture, the enzymes of gene methylation \r\nare known to be increased, relative to their normal activity (Wang, \r\net al., 2005).The \r\nphenomenon of \"gene\" methylation in response to environmental \r\nand metabolic conditions may eventually lead to the extinction of the \r\ndoctrine that \"cells are controlled by their genes.\"During \r\nsuccessful adaptation to stress, cells make adjustments to their metabolic \r\nsystems (for example with a holistic change of the degree of phosphorylation, \r\nwhich increases molecules' affinity for water), and their metabolic \r\nprocesses can contribute to changes in their state of differentiation. \r\nSome changes may lead to successful adaptation (for example by producing \r\nbiogenic stimulators that stimulate cell functioning and regeneration), \r\nothers to failed adaptation. Even the decomposition of cells can release \r\nsubstances that contribute to the adaptation of surrounding cells, for \r\nexample when sphingosines stimulate the production of stem cells.DNA \r\nmethylation is just one relatively stable event that occurs in relation \r\nto a metabolic field.  Modifications of histones (regulatory proteins \r\nin chromosomes, which are acetylated as well as methylated) and structural-contractile \r\nfilaments also contribute to the differentiation of cells, but the pattern \r\nof DNA methylation seems to guide the methylation of histones and the \r\nstructure of the chromosomes (Nan, et al., 1998).Steroids \r\nand phospholipids, neurotransmitters and endorphins, ATP, GTP, other \r\nphosphates, retinoids, NO and CO2--many materials and processes participate \r\nin the coherence of the living state, the living substance. Carbon dioxide, \r\nfor example, by binding to lysine amino groups in the histones, will \r\ninfluence their methylation.  Carbon dioxide is likely to affect \r\nother amino groups in the chromosomes.The \r\nnumber and arrangement of mitochondria is an important factor in producing \r\nand maintaining the metabolic gradients. Things that decrease mitochondrial \r\nenergy production--nitric oxide, histamine, cytokines, cortisol--increase \r\nDNA methylation. Decreased gene expression is associated with reduced \r\nrespiratory energy. It seems reasonable to guess that increased gene \r\nexpression would demand increased availability of energy.As \r\nan ovum differentiates into an organism, cells become progressively \r\nmore specialized, inhibiting the expression of many genes. Less energy \r\nis needed by stably functioning cells, than by actively adapting cells. \r\nA.I. Zotin described the process of maturing and differentiating as \r\na decrease of entropy, an increase of order accompanying a decreased \r\nenergy expenditure. The entropic egg develops into a less entropic embryo \r\nwith a great expenditure of energy.The \r\npartially differentiated stem cell doesn't go through all the stages \r\nof development, but it does expend energy intensely as it matures.The \r\nrestoration of energy is one requirement for the activation of regeneration. \r\nWhen a hormone such as noradrenaline or insulin causes a stem cell to \r\ndifferentiate in vitro, it causes new mitochondria to form. This is \r\nsomewhat analogous to the insertion of mitochondria into the ripening \r\noocyte, by the nurse cells that surround it. The conditionally decreased \r\nentropy of maturation is reversed, and when sufficient respiratory energy \r\nis available, the renewed and refreshed cell will be able to renew an \r\nappropriate degree of differentiation.When \r\nsimple organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, or protozoa are stressed, \r\nfor example by the absence of nutrients or the presence of toxins, they \r\nslow their metabolism, and suppress the expression of genes, increasing \r\nthe methylation of DNA, to form resistant and quiescent spores. Our \r\ndifferentiated state doesn't go to the metabolic extreme seen in sporulation, \r\nbut it's useful to look at maturity and aging in this context, because \r\nit suggests that the wrong kind of stress decreases the ability of the \r\norganism to adapt, by processes resembling those in the spore-forming \r\norganisms.Charles \r\nVacanti, who has grown cartilage from cells taken from 100 year old \r\nhuman cartilage, believes our tissues contain \"spore cells,\" \r\nvery small cells with slow metabolism and extreme resistance to heat, \r\ncold, and starvation.If \r\nthe slowed metabolism of aging, like that of sporulating cells, is produced \r\nby a certain kind of stress that lowers cellular energy and functions, \r\nit might be useful to think of the other stages of the stress reaction \r\nin relation to the production of stem cells. Selye divided stress into \r\na first stage of shock, followed by a prolonged adaptation, which could \r\nsometimes end in exhaustion. If the maturity of differentiated functioning \r\nis equivalent to the adaptation phase, and cellular decline and disintegration \r\nis the exhaustion phase, then the shock-like reaction would correspond \r\nto the birth of new stem cells.Selye \r\ndescribed estrogen's effects as equivalent to the shock-phase of stress. \r\nEstrogen's basic action is to make oxygen unavailable, lowering the \r\noxygen tension of the tissues, locally and temporarily. Like nitric \r\noxide, which is produced by estrogenic stimulation, estrogen interferes \r\nwith energy production, so if its stimulation is prolonged, cells are \r\ndamaged or killed, rather than being stimulated to regenerate.Extrinsic \r\nfactors elicit renewal, the way stress can elicit adaptation. While \r\naging cells can't use the oxygen that is present, a scarcity of oxygen \r\ncan serve as a stimulus to maximize the respiratory systems. Brief oxygen \r\ndeprivation excites a cell, causes it to swell, and to begin to divide.Oxygen \r\ndeprivation, as in the normally hypoxic bone marrow, stimulates the \r\nformation of stem cells, as well as the biogenesis of mitochondria. \r\nAs the newly formed cells, with abundant mitochondria, get adequate \r\noxygen, they begin differentiation.Form, \r\nbased on cellular differentiation, follows function--a vein transplanted \r\ninto an artery develops anatomically into an artery, a colon attached \r\ndirectly to the anus becomes a new rectum with its appropriate innervation, \r\na broken bone restructures to form a normal bone. If the bladder is \r\nforced to function more than normal, by artificially keeping it filled, \r\nits thin wall of smooth muscle develops into a thick wall of striated \r\nmuscle that rhythmically contracts, like the heart. If a tadpole is \r\ngiven a vegetarian diet, the absorptive surface of its digestive system \r\nwill develop to be twice the size of those that are fed meat. Pressure, \r\nstretching, and pulsation are among the signals that guide cells' differentiation.Very \r\nearly in the study of embryology it was noticed that the presence of \r\none tissue sometimes induced the differentiation of another kind, and \r\nalso that there were factors in embryonic tissues that would stimulate \r\ncell division generally, and others that could inhibit the growth of \r\na particular tissue type. Diffusable substances and light were among \r\nthe factors identified as growth regulators.Extracts \r\nof particular tissues were found to suppress the multiplication of cells \r\nin that type of tissue, in adult animals as well as in embryos. In the \r\n1960s, the tissue-specific inhibitors were called chalones.The \r\nbrain's development is governed by the presence in the organism of the \r\nbody part to which it corresponds, such as the eyes or legs. The number \r\nof cells in a particular part of the nervous system is governed by the \r\nquantity of nervous input, sensory or motor, that it receives. An enriched \r\nenvironment causes a bigger brain to grow. Sensory nerve stimulation \r\nof a particular region of the brain causes nerve cells to migrate to \r\nthat area (a process called neurobiotaxis; deBeers, 1927), but nerve \r\nstimulation also causes mitochondria to accumulate in stimulated areas. \r\nNerve activity has a trophic, sustaining influence on other organs, \r\nas well as on the brain. Nerve stimulation, like mechanical pressure \r\nor stretching, is an important signal for cellular differentiation.When \r\nstem cells or progenitor cells are called on to replace cells in an \r\norgan, they are said to be \"recruited\" by that organ, or to \r\n\"home\" to that organ, if they are coming from elsewhere. Traditionally, \r\nthe bone marrow has been considered to be the source of circulating \r\nstem cells, but it now appears that a variety of other less differentiated \r\ncells can be recruited when needed. Cells from the blood can repair \r\nthe endothelium of blood vessels, and endothelial cells can become mesenchymal \r\ncells, in the heart, for example.The \r\nstandard doctrine about cancer is that a tumor derives from a single \r\nmutant cell, but it has been known for a long time that different types \r\nof cell, such as phagocytes and mast cells, usually reside in tumors, \r\nand it is now becoming clear that tumors recruit cells, including apparently \r\nnormal cells, from other parts of the same organ. For example, a brain \r\ntumor of glial cells, a glioma, recruits glial cells from surrounding \r\nareas of the brain, in a process that's analogous to the embryological \r\nmovement of nerve cells to a center of excitation. Each tumor, in a \r\nsense, seems to be a center of excitation, and its fate seems to depend \r\non the nature of the cells that respond to its signals.To \r\naccommodate some of the newer facts about tumors, the cancer establishment \r\nhas begun speaking of \"the cancer stem cell\" as the real villain, \r\nthe origin of the tumor, while the bulk of the tumor is seen to be made \r\nup of defective cells that have a short life-span. But if we recognize \r\nthat tumors are recruiting cells from beyond their boundaries, this \r\nprocess would account for the growth and survival of a tumor even while \r\nmost of its cells are inert and dying, without invoking the invisible \r\ncancer stem cell. And this view, that it is the field which is defective \r\nrather than the cell, is consistent with the evidence which has been \r\naccumulating for 35 years that tumor cells, given the right environment, \r\ncan differentiate into healthy cells. (Hendrix, et al., 2007)Simply \r\nstretching an organ (Woo, et al., 2007) is stimulus enough to cause \r\nit to recruit cells from the bloodstream, and will probably stimulate \r\nmultiplication in its local resident cells, too. Every \"cancer \r\nfield\" probably begins as a healing process, and generally the \r\nhealing and regeneration are at least partially successful.When \r\nan organ--the brain, heart, liver, or a blood vessel--is inflamed or \r\nsuffering from an insufficient blood supply, stem cells introduced into \r\nthe blood will migrate specifically to that organ.Organ \r\nspecific materials (chalones) are known to circulate in the blood, inhibiting \r\ncell division in cells typical to that organ, but it also seems that \r\norgan specific materials are secreted by a damaged organ, that help \r\nto prepare stem cells for their migration into that organ. When undifferentiated \r\ncells are cultured with serum from a person with liver failure, they \r\nbegin to differentiate into liver cells.It \r\nis still common to speak of each organ as having a \"clonal origin\" \r\nin the differentiating embryo, as a simple expansion of a certain embryonic \r\nanlage. The implication of this way of thinking is that differentiation \r\nisdeterminationin an irreversible sense. This is another case \r\nof medical ideas being based on images of fixed histological material. \r\nNormal cells, including nerve and muscle cells, can change type, with \r\nconnective tissue cells becoming nerve cells, nerve cells becoming muscle \r\nand fiber cells, fat, fiber, and muscle cells redifferentiating, for \r\nexample.Cell \r\nmovements in solid tissues aren't limited to the short distances between \r\ncapillaries and the tissues nourished by those capillaries, rather, \r\ncells can migrate much greater distances, without entering the bloodstream. \r\nThe speed of a single cell moving by ameboid motion can be measured \r\nby watching cells on a glass slide as they move toward food, or by watching \r\ncells of the slime mold Dictyostelium when they are aggregating, or \r\nby watching the pigment cells in and around moles or melanomas, under \r\nthe influence of hormones. At body temperature, a single cell can crawl \r\nabout an inch per day. Waves or spots of brown pigment can be seen migrating \r\nthrough the skin away from a mole, preceding the disintegration of the \r\nmole under the influence of progesterone or DHEA. Under ordinary conditions, \r\npigment cells can sometimes be seen migrating into depigmented areas \r\nof skin, during the recovery of an area affected by vitiligo. These \r\norganized movements of masses of cells happen to be easy to see, but \r\nthere is evidence that other types of cell can reconstruct tissues by \r\ntheir ameboid movements, when circumstances are right. Tumors or tissue \r\nabnormalities can appear or disappear with a suddenness that seems impossible \r\nto people who have studied only fixed tissue preparations.Stimulation \r\nis anabolic, building tissue, when the organism is adapting to the stimulation. \r\nUnused structures in cells and tissues are always being recycled by \r\nmetabolic processes. When tissues are injured and become unable to function, \r\nsome of their substances stimulate the growth of replacement cells.Some \r\ntypes of injury or irritation can activate regenerative processes. A \r\ndermatology journal described the case of an old man who had been bald \r\nfor many years who fell head-first into his fireplace. As his burned \r\nscalp healed, new hair grew. In the U.S., experimenters (Ito, et al., \r\n2007) have found that injuring the skin of mice stimulates the formation \r\nof stem cells that are able to become hair follicle cells, supporting \r\nthe regeneration of cells that had been absent. A brief exposure to \r\nestrogen, and other stress related signals (nitric oxide, endorphin, \r\nprostaglandins) can initiate stem cell proliferation.In \r\nthe years after the first world war, Vladimir Filatov, who developed \r\ntechniques of reconstructive surgery, including corneal transplants, \r\nfound that cold storage of tissues (for example, corneas from cadavers) \r\ncaused them to function better than fresh tissues, and he found that \r\nthese stressed tissues would often spread a healing influence out into \r\nthe surrounding tissues. Extracts of stressed tissues produced similar \r\neffects.L.V. \r\nPolezhaev began studying the regenerative capacities of mammals in the \r\nlate 1940s, and his work showed that processes similar to embryonic \r\ninduction are involved in the organism's responses to damaged tissues. \r\nFor example, when a piece of killed muscle tissue is enclosed in a capsule \r\n(\"diffusion chamber\") that permits molecules, but no cells, \r\nto diffuse through it, and implanted subcutaneously, it had no inductive \r\neffect on surrounding cells. But when the pores of the capsule allowed \r\ncells to enter, skeletal muscle formed where the dead tissue had been, \r\nand tissue resembling heart muscle formed outside the capsule. Phagocytosis \r\nhad been essential for the induction to occur.Macrophages \r\nare ordinarily thought of as \"antigen-presenting cells\" that \r\nhelp to activate the specific immune responses. But apparently phagocytosis \r\nis involved in the replacement of damaged tissues, by recruiting or \r\ninducing the differentiation of replacement cells. The phagocytosis \r\nfunction isn't limited to the blood cells commonly called phagocytes; \r\neven nerve cells can ingest particles and fragments of damaged tissues.Many \r\nfactors regulate the process of phagocytosis. Stress and lipid peroxidation \r\ndecrease phagocytosis (Izgüt-Uysal, et al., 2004), and also damage \r\nmitochondria and inhibit cell renewal.Unsaturated \r\nfatty acids inhibit phagocytosis (Guimaraes, et al., 1991, 1992; Costa \r\nRosa, et al., 1996; Virella, et al., 1989; Akamatsu, et al., 1990), \r\nand suppress mitochondrial function (Gomes, et al., 2006).  Dietary \r\nrestriction activates phagocytosis (Moriguchi, et al., 1989), suggesting \r\nthat normal diets contain suppressive materials.Subnormal \r\ntemperatures cause a shift from phagocytosis to inflammation. Light, \r\nespecially the red light which penetrates easily into tissues, activates \r\nthe formation of new cells as well as their differentiation. It affects \r\nenergy production, increasing the formation of mitochondria, and the \r\nactivity of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes. Red light accelerates \r\nwound healing, and improves the quality of the scar, reducing the amount \r\nof fibrosis. The daily cycling between darkness and light is probably \r\nan important factor in regulating the birth and differentiation of cells..Darkness \r\nsuppresses mitochondrial function, and light activates it. Prolonged \r\ndarkness increases cortisol, and cortisol (which makes cells more susceptible \r\nto excitotoxic death) inhibits stem cell proliferation (Li, et al., \r\n2006; Liu, et al., 2003). Neurogenesis is suppressed by stress, and \r\nincreased by spontaneous activity, and has a circadian rhythm. Aging \r\nand depression both involve a diminished ability to rhythmically lower \r\nthe production of cortisol. Cell renewal requires a rhythmic decrease \r\nin the exposure to cortisol..In \r\nthe spring, with increased day length, the brains of song-birds grow, \r\nwith an increased proliferation of cells in the part of the brain involved \r\nin singing. The production of progesterone increases in most animals \r\nin the spring, and it is the main hormone responsible for the birds' \r\nbrain growth.Progesterone \r\nand its metabolites protect brain cells against injury, and improve \r\nthe brain's ability to recover after traumatic injury (Brinton and Wang, \r\n2006). In the 1960s, Marion Diamond's group showed that environmental \r\nenrichment, or progesterone, caused brains to grow larger, and that \r\nthese changes were passed on to descendants in a cumulative, increasing \r\nway. This suggests that the factors that promote neurogenesis also cause \r\nchanges in the apparatus of reproduction and inheritance, that support \r\nthe development of the brain--probably including the methylation system, \r\nwhich is involved in regulating genes, and also mood and behavior.Women's \r\nmonthly cycles, in which a brief estrogen dominance is followed by sustained \r\nexposure to progesterone, are probably an important factor in the renewal \r\nof the cells of the brain and other organs, as well as those of the \r\nreproductive organs. The daily rhythms of hormones and metabolism are \r\nknown to be involved in the regulation of cell renewal.Environmental \r\nenrichment, learning, high altitude, and thyroid hormone promote the \r\nformation of new mitochondria, and stimulate stem cell proliferation. \r\nAt least in some laboratories, 20% oxygen, approximately the amount \r\nas in the atmosphere, suppresses the proliferation of stem cells (He, \r\net al., 2007). This was the unphysiologically high concentration of \r\noxygen used in Hayflick's cell cultures. At high altitudes, where tissues \r\nare exposed to less oxygen, and more carbon dioxide, there is a lower \r\nincidence of all the degenerative diseases, including cancer, heart \r\ndisease, and dementia. Improved cellular energy production and more \r\nactive renewal of cells would probably account for those differences.For \r\nCrick, the idea of a diffusion gradient to explain embryonic development \r\nwas simply an extension of his reductionist orientation, in which diffusing \r\nmolecules induced or inhibited bacterial genes, and in which genes controlled \r\ncells. For people with that orientation, the adaptive mutations described \r\nby Carl Lindegren, and later by John Cairns, or even the stress-induced \r\nvariability described by Lysenko, Strong, and McClintock, were heretical. \r\nPolezhaev's demonstration that cells could do something that molecular \r\ndiffusion didn't do, threatened to take biology away from the reductionists. \r\nIf the organism's adaptation to the environment involves changing its \r\nown genes, Crick's paradigm fails.Crick's \r\nCentral Dogma, derived from the ideology that produced Weismann's Barrier, \r\nhas been invoked by generations of professors who wanted to deny the \r\npossibility of adaptive tissue renewal and regeneration. Without the \r\ndogma, new ideas about aging and disease will be needed. If somatic \r\ncells can adjust their genes, and if they can also differentiate into \r\nnew eggs and sperms, new ideas about inheritance of acquired traits \r\nwill be needed.The \r\nreplacement of injured cells means that mutations need not accumulate. \r\nCell renewal with elimination of mutant cells has been observed in sun-damaged \r\nskin simply by stopping the damage, and mitochondria with damaged DNA \r\ncan be replaced by healthy mitochondria simply by doing the right kind \r\nof exercise.The \r\nregulation of cell renewal probably involves all of the processes of \r\nlife, but there are a few simple, interacting factors that suppress \r\nrenewal. The accumulation of polyunsaturated fats, interacting with \r\na high concentration of oxygen, damages mitochondria, and causes a chronic \r\nexcessive exposure to cortisol. With mitochondrial damage, cells are \r\nunable to produce the progesterone needed to oppose cortisol and to \r\nprotect cells.Choosing \r\nthe right foods, the right atmosphere, the right mental and physical \r\nactivities, and finding the optimal rhythms of light, darkness, and \r\nactivity, can begin to alter the streaming renewal of cells in all the \r\norgans. Designing a more perfect environment is going to be much simpler \r\nthan the schemes of the genetic engineers.REFERENCESGrowth \r\n43, 58-61, 1979.The effect of progesterone on brain and body growth \r\nof chick embryos.G.

All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com Cell \r\nrenewal is a factor in all aspects of health and disease, not just in \r\naging and the degenerative diseases. Many people are doing valid research \r\nrelating to cell renewal and regeneration, but its usefulness is seriously \r\nlimited by cultural and commercial constraints. By recovering some of \r\nour suppressed traditional culture, I think regenerative therapies can \r\nbe developed quickly, by identifying and eliminating as far as possible \r\nthe main factors that interfere with tissue renewal. Science \r\ngrew up in the highly authoritarian cultures of western Europe, and \r\neven as it contributed to cultural change, it kept an authoritarian \r\nmystique. Any culture functions as a system of definitions of reality \r\nand the limits of possibility, and to a great extent the \"laws \r\nof nature\" are decreed so that they will harmonize with the recognized \r\nlaws of society. The \r\npractical success of Newton's \"laws\" of motion when they were \r\napplied to ballistics and \"rocket science\" has led many people \r\nto value calculation, based on those laws, over evidence. In biology, \r\nthe idea that an organism is \"the information it contains in its \r\nDNA blueprint\" is an extention of this. The organism is turned \r\ninto something like a deductive expression of the law of DNA. This attitude \r\nhas been disastrous. The \r\nold feudal idea of a divine and stable social organization was applied \r\nby some people to their idea of biological organization, in which each \r\ncell (ruled by its nucleus) had its ordained place in the organism, \r\nwith the brain and the \"master gland,\" the pituitary, ruling \r\nthe subordinate organs, tissues, and cells. \"Anatomy\" was \r\ntaught from dead specimens, microscope slides, and illustrations in \r\nbooks. Most biologists' thoughts about cells in organisms reflect the \r\nstatic imagery of their instruction. (\"The histological image \r\nof these tissues actually reflects an instantaneous picture of cells \r\nin a continuous flux.\"Zajicek, 1981.) When \r\na person has playful and observant interactions with natural things, \r\nboth regularities and irregularities will be noticed, and in trying \r\nto understand those events, the richness of the experience will suggest \r\nan expansive range of possibilities. Perception and experimentation \r\nlead to understandings that are independent of culture and tradition. But \r\nthe mystique of science easily imposes itself, and distracts our attention \r\nfrom direct interactions with things. As we learn to operate lab instruments, \r\nwe are taught the kinds of results that can be expected, and the concepts \r\nthat will explain and predict the results of our operations. Science, \r\nas we learn about it in schools and the mass media, is mostly a set \r\nof catechisms. Our \r\ntheories about organisms inform our experiments with cells or tissues \r\nthat have been isolated from those organisms. The conditions for growing \r\ncells in dishes are thought of as \"physiological,\" in relation \r\nto the solution's \"physiological osmolarity,\" \"physiological \r\npH,\" nutrients, oxygenation, temperature, pressure, etc. But these \r\nconcepts of what is physiological derive from the monolithic ideology \r\nof the doctrinaire, and often fraudulent, mainstream of biological science. The \r\ncatechismic nature of science has led people to expect some \"break-throughs\" \r\n\r\nto occur in certain areas, and as authoritarian science has grown into \r\n\"big science\" managed by corporations and governments, those \r\nbreak-throughs are generally expected to be produced by the newest and \r\nmost expensive developments of \"high technology.\" But \r\nlooking closely at the real events and processes in the sciences in \r\nthe last couple of centuries, it turns out that useful advances have \r\nbeen produced mainly by breaking away from authoritarian doctrines, \r\nto return to common sense and relatively simple direct observations. Although \r\npeople were cloning animals in the 1960s, it was still widely taught \r\nthat it was impossible. The students of the professors who taught that \r\nit was impossible are now saying that it requires high technology and \r\nnew research. For \r\nthe last 100 years the most authoritative view in biology has been that \r\nthere are no stem cells in adults, that brains, hearts, pancreases and \r\noocytes are absolutely incapable of regeneration. But now, people seem \r\nto be finding stem cells wherever they look, but there is a mystique \r\nof high technology involved in finding and using them. Whether \r\nit's deliberate or not, the emphasis on stem cell technology has the \r\nfunction of directing attention away from traditional knowledge, the \r\nway allopathic medicine has de-emphasized the intrinsic ability of people \r\nto recover from disease. This \r\nresembles the way that the Mendel-Morgan gene doctrine was used to suppress \r\nthe knowledge gained from centuries of experience of plant and animal \r\nbreeders, and to belittle the discoveries of Luther Burbank, Paul Kammerer, \r\nTrofim Lysenko, and Barbara McClintock. The same type of biochemical \r\nprocess that caused the hereditary changes those researchers studied \r\nare involved in the differentiation and dedifferentiation of stem cells \r\nthat regulate healing and regeneration. In \r\nthe 1940s, even children discussed the biological discoveries of the \r\n1920s and 1930s, the work in regeneration and adaptation, parthenogenesis, \r\nand immortalization. The ideas of J. Loeb, T. Boveri, A. Gurwitsch, \r\nJ. Needham, C.M. Child, A. Carrel, et al., had become part of the general \r\nculture. But \r\nthat real biology was killed by a consortium of industry and government \r\nthat began a little before the second world war. In 1940, the government \r\nwas supporting research in chemical and biological warfare, and with \r\nthe Manhattan Project the role of government became so large that all \r\nof the major research universities were affected. Shortly after the \r\nwar, many researchers from the Manhattan Project were redeployed into \r\n\"molecular genetics,\" where the engineering attitude was applied \r\nto organisms. The \r\nsimplistic genetic dogmas were compatible with the reductionist engineering \r\napproach to the organism. The role of the government assured that the \r\nuniversities would subscribe to the basic scientific agenda. The atmosphere \r\nof that time was described by Carl Lindegren as \"The Cold War in \r\nBiology\" (1966). The \r\ndisappearance of the field concept in developmental biology was one \r\nof the strangest events in the history of science. It didn't just fade \r\naway, it was \"disappeared,\" in a massive undertaking of social \r\nengineering. In its absence, stem cells will seem to be a profitable \r\ntechnological marvel, rather than a universal life function, with a \r\ncentral role in everything we are and everything we do and can become. Many \r\npeople have tried to explain aging as a loss of cells, resulting from \r\nan intrinsic inability of any cell other than a germ cell to multiply \r\nmore than a certain number of times. More than 40 years ago Leonard \r\nHayflick popularized this doctrine in its most extreme form, saying \r\nthat no cell can divide more than 50 times unless it is converted into \r\na cancer cell. He and his followers claimed that they had explained \r\nwhy organisms must age and die. At the moment the ovum is fertilized, \r\nthe clock starts ticking for the essentially mortal somatic cells. In \r\n1970, it was being seriously proposed that memory was produced by the \r\ndeath of brain cells, in a manner analogous to the holes punched in \r\ncards to enter data into computers. The cultural dogma made it impossible \r\nto consider that learning could be associated with the birth of new \r\ncells in the adult brain. With \r\nthe announcement in 1997 of the cloning of the sheep Dolly from a somatic \r\ncell taken from a 6 year old sheep, there was renewed interest in the \r\nidea made famous by Alexis Carrel that all cells are potentially immortal, \r\nand in the possibility of preserving the vitality of human cells. Within \r\na few months, Hayflick began reminding the public that \"In the \r\nearly 1960's we overthrew this dogma after finding that normal cells \r\ndo have a finite replicative capacity.\" (\"During the first \r\nhalf of this century it was believed that because cultured normal cells \r\nwere immortal, aging must be caused by extra-cellular events.\") \r\nThe way Hayflick \"overthrew\" more than 35 years of work at \r\nthe Rockefeller Institute was by growing one type of cell, a lung fibroblast, \r\nin culture dishes, and finding that the cultures deteriorated quickly. To \r\ndraw global conclusions about an organism's development and aging from \r\nthe degenerative processes seen in a single type of cell, grown in isolation \r\nfrom all normal stimuli, would have been treated as nothing but wild \r\nspeculation, except that it occurred within a culture that needed it. \r\nNo aspect of Hayflick's cell culture system could properly be called \r\nphysiological. Other \r\nresearchers, simply by changing a single factor, caused great increases \r\nin the longevity of the cultured cells. Simply using a lower, more natural \r\noxygen concentration, the cells were able to undergo 20 more divisions. \r\nJust by adding niacin, 30 more divisions; vitamin E, 70 more divisions. \r\nExcess oxygen is a poison requiring constant adaptation. Hayflick \r\nalso published the observation that, while the cells kept in dishes \r\nat approximately body temperature deteriorated, cells kept frozen in \r\nliquid nitrogen didn't deteriorate, and he concluded that \"time\" \r\nwasn't the cause of aging. When I read his comments about the frozen \r\ncells, I wondered how anyone of normal intelligence could make such \r\nstupid statements. Since then, facts that came out because of the Freedom \r\nof Information Act, cause me to believe that a financial motive guided \r\nhis thoughts about his cultured fibroblasts. Hayflick \r\nand his followers have been attacking the idea of anti-aging medicine \r\nas quackery. But he is closely involved with the Geron corporation, \r\nwhich proposes that genetic alterations relating to telomeres may be \r\nable to cure cancer and prevent aging. Their claims were reported by \r\nCNN as \"Scientists discover cellular 'fountain of youth'.\" The \r\n\"wear and tear\" doctrine of aging that derived from the ideology \r\nof the gene was reinforced and renewed by Hayflick's cell culture observations, \r\nand it continued to rule the universities and popular culture. But \r\ndetailed investigation of skin cell growth showed that cells in the \r\nlower layer of the skin divide at least 10,000 times in a normal lifetime, \r\nand similar processes occur in the lining of the intestine. The endometrium \r\nand other highly renewable tissues just as obviously violated Hayflick's \r\nlimit. Transplantation experiments showed that pieces of mammary tissue \r\nor skin tissue could survive through ten normal lifetimes of experimental \r\nanimals without suffering the effects of aging. Even \r\nthe liver and adrenal gland are now known to be continuously renewed \r\nby \"cell streaming,\" though at a slower rate than the skin, \r\nconjunctiva, and intestine. Neurogenesis in the brain is now not only \r\nwidely accepted, it is even proposed as a mechanism to explain the therapeutic \r\neffects of antidepressants (Santarelli, et al., 2003). August \r\nWeismann's most influential doctrine said that \"somatic cells are \r\nmortal, only the germline cells are immortal,\" but he based the \r\ndoctrine on his mistaken belief that only the \"germline\" cells \r\ncontained all the genes of the organism. In 1885, to \"refute\" \r\nDarwin's belief that acquired traits could be inherited, he promulgated \r\nan absolute \"barrier\" between \"germline\" and \"soma,\" \r\n\r\nand invented facts to show that hereditary information can flow only \r\nfrom the germline to the somatic cells, and not the other direction. \r\nShortly after DNA became popular in the 1950s as \"the genetic material,\" \r\nWeismann's barrier was restated as the Central Dogma of molecular genetics, \r\nthat information flows only from DNA to RNA to protein, and never the \r\nother direction. It \r\nwas only in 2003, after the reality of cloning was widely recognized, \r\nthat a few experimenters began to investigate the origin of \"germline\" \r\ncells in the ovary, and to discover that they derive from somatic cells \r\n(Johnson, et al., 2004). With this discovery, the ancient knowledge \r\nthat a twig (klon, in Greek) cut from a tree could grow into \r\na whole tree, bearing fruit and viable seeds, was readmitted to general \r\nbiology, and the Weismann barrier was seen to be an illusion. Millions \r\nof people have \"explained\" female reproductive aging as the \r\nconsequence of the ovary \"running out of eggs.\" Innumerable \r\npublications purported to show the exact ways in which that process \r\noccurs, following the Weismann doctrine. But now that it is clear that \r\nadult ovaries can give birth to new oocytes, a new explanation for female \r\nreproductive aging is needed. It is likely that the same factors that \r\ncause female reproductive aging also cause aging of other systems and \r\norgans and tissues, and that those factors are extrinsic to the cells \r\nthemselves, as Alexis Carrel and others demonstrated long ago. This \r\nis a way of saying that all cells are potential stem cells. The \"niche\" \r\n\r\nin which new cells are born in the streaming organism, and the processes \r\nby which damaged cells are removed, are physiological issues that can \r\nbe illuminated by the idea of a morphogenetic field. When \r\nthe post-war genetic engineers took over biological research, the idea \r\nof a biophysical field was totally abandoned, but after about 15 years, \r\nit became necessary to think of problems beyond those existing within \r\na single bacterium, namely, the problem of how an ovum becomes and embryo. \r\nFrancis Crick, of DNA fame, who was educated as a physicist, revived \r\n(without a meaningful historical context) the idea of a diffusion gradient \r\nas a simple integrating factor that wouldn't be too offensive to the \r\nreductionists. But for events far beyond the scale of the egg's internal \r\nstructure, for example to explain how a nerve axon can travel a very \r\nlong distance to innervate exactly the right kind of cell, the diffusion \r\nof molecules loses its simplicity and plausibility. (Early in the history \r\nof experimental embryology, it was observed that electrical fields affect \r\nthe direction of growth of nerve fibers.) C. \r\nM. Child saw a gradient of metabolic activity as an essential component \r\nof the morphogenetic field. This kind of gradient doesn't deny the existence \r\nof diffusion gradients, or other physical components of a field. Electrical \r\nand osmotic (and electro-osmotic) events are generated by metabolism, \r\nand affect other factors, including pH, oxidation and reduction, cell \r\nmotility and cell shape, ionic selectivity and other types of cellular \r\nselectivity and specificity. Gradients of DNA methylation exist, and \r\naffect the expression of inherited information. Methylation \r\ndecreases the expression of particular genes, and during the differention \r\nof cells in the development of an embryo, genes are methylated and demethylated \r\nas the cell adapts to produce the proteins that are involved in the \r\nstructure and function of a particular tissue. Methylation (which increases \r\na molecule's affinity for fats) is a widespread process in cells, and \r\nfor example regulates cellular excitability. It is affected by diet \r\nand a variety of stresses. DNA \r\nmethylation patterns are normally fairly stable, and can help to account \r\nfor the transgenerational transmission of acquired adaptations, and \r\nfor neonatal imprinting that can last a lifetime. But with injury, stress, \r\nand aging, the methylation patterns of differentiated tissues can be \r\nchanged, contributing to the development of tumors, or to the loss of \r\ncellular functions. Even learning can change the methylation of specific \r\ngenes. Duringin vitroculture, the enzymes of gene methylation \r\nare known to be increased, relative to their normal activity (Wang, \r\net al., 2005). The \r\nphenomenon of \"gene\" methylation in response to environmental \r\nand metabolic conditions may eventually lead to the extinction of the \r\ndoctrine that \"cells are controlled by their genes.\" During \r\nsuccessful adaptation to stress, cells make adjustments to their metabolic \r\nsystems (for example with a holistic change of the degree of phosphorylation, \r\nwhich increases molecules' affinity for water), and their metabolic \r\nprocesses can contribute to changes in their state of differentiation. \r\nSome changes may lead to successful adaptation (for example by producing \r\nbiogenic stimulators that stimulate cell functioning and regeneration), \r\nothers to failed adaptation. Even the decomposition of cells can release \r\nsubstances that contribute to the adaptation of surrounding cells, for \r\nexample when sphingosines stimulate the production of stem cells. DNA \r\nmethylation is just one relatively stable event that occurs in relation \r\nto a metabolic field.  Modifications of histones (regulatory proteins \r\nin chromosomes, which are acetylated as well as methylated) and structural-contractile \r\nfilaments also contribute to the differentiation of cells, but the pattern \r\nof DNA methylation seems to guide the methylation of histones and the \r\nstructure of the chromosomes (Nan, et al., 1998). Steroids \r\nand phospholipids, neurotransmitters and endorphins, ATP, GTP, other \r\nphosphates, retinoids, NO and CO2--many materials and processes participate \r\nin the coherence of the living state, the living substance. Carbon dioxide, \r\nfor example, by binding to lysine amino groups in the histones, will \r\ninfluence their methylation.  Carbon dioxide is likely to affect \r\nother amino groups in the chromosomes. The \r\nnumber and arrangement of mitochondria is an important factor in producing \r\nand maintaining the metabolic gradients. Things that decrease mitochondrial \r\nenergy production--nitric oxide, histamine, cytokines, cortisol--increase \r\nDNA methylation. Decreased gene expression is associated with reduced \r\nrespiratory energy. It seems reasonable to guess that increased gene \r\nexpression would demand increased availability of energy. As \r\nan ovum differentiates into an organism, cells become progressively \r\nmore specialized, inhibiting the expression of many genes. Less energy \r\nis needed by stably functioning cells, than by actively adapting cells. \r\nA.I. Zotin described the process of maturing and differentiating as \r\na decrease of entropy, an increase of order accompanying a decreased \r\nenergy expenditure. The entropic egg develops into a less entropic embryo \r\nwith a great expenditure of energy. The \r\npartially differentiated stem cell doesn't go through all the stages \r\nof development, but it does expend energy intensely as it matures. The \r\nrestoration of energy is one requirement for the activation of regeneration. \r\nWhen a hormone such as noradrenaline or insulin causes a stem cell to \r\ndifferentiate in vitro, it causes new mitochondria to form. This is \r\nsomewhat analogous to the insertion of mitochondria into the ripening \r\noocyte, by the nurse cells that surround it. The conditionally decreased \r\nentropy of maturation is reversed, and when sufficient respiratory energy \r\nis available, the renewed and refreshed cell will be able to renew an \r\nappropriate degree of differentiation. When \r\nsimple organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, or protozoa are stressed, \r\nfor example by the absence of nutrients or the presence of toxins, they \r\nslow their metabolism, and suppress the expression of genes, increasing \r\nthe methylation of DNA, to form resistant and quiescent spores. Our \r\ndifferentiated state doesn't go to the metabolic extreme seen in sporulation, \r\nbut it's useful to look at maturity and aging in this context, because \r\nit suggests that the wrong kind of stress decreases the ability of the \r\norganism to adapt, by processes resembling those in the spore-forming \r\norganisms. Charles \r\nVacanti, who has grown cartilage from cells taken from 100 year old \r\nhuman cartilage, believes our tissues contain \"spore cells,\" \r\nvery small cells with slow metabolism and extreme resistance to heat, \r\ncold, and starvation. If \r\nthe slowed metabolism of aging, like that of sporulating cells, is produced \r\nby a certain kind of stress that lowers cellular energy and functions, \r\nit might be useful to think of the other stages of the stress reaction \r\nin relation to the production of stem cells. Selye divided stress into \r\na first stage of shock, followed by a prolonged adaptation, which could \r\nsometimes end in exhaustion. If the maturity of differentiated functioning \r\nis equivalent to the adaptation phase, and cellular decline and disintegration \r\nis the exhaustion phase, then the shock-like reaction would correspond \r\nto the birth of new stem cells. Selye \r\ndescribed estrogen's effects as equivalent to the shock-phase of stress. \r\nEstrogen's basic action is to make oxygen unavailable, lowering the \r\noxygen tension of the tissues, locally and temporarily. Like nitric \r\noxide, which is produced by estrogenic stimulation, estrogen interferes \r\nwith energy production, so if its stimulation is prolonged, cells are \r\ndamaged or killed, rather than being stimulated to regenerate. Extrinsic \r\nfactors elicit renewal, the way stress can elicit adaptation. While \r\naging cells can't use the oxygen that is present, a scarcity of oxygen \r\ncan serve as a stimulus to maximize the respiratory systems. Brief oxygen \r\ndeprivation excites a cell, causes it to swell, and to begin to divide. Oxygen \r\ndeprivation, as in the normally hypoxic bone marrow, stimulates the \r\nformation of stem cells, as well as the biogenesis of mitochondria. \r\nAs the newly formed cells, with abundant mitochondria, get adequate \r\noxygen, they begin differentiation. Form, \r\nbased on cellular differentiation, follows function--a vein transplanted \r\ninto an artery develops anatomically into an artery, a colon attached \r\ndirectly to the anus becomes a new rectum with its appropriate innervation, \r\na broken bone restructures to form a normal bone. If the bladder is \r\nforced to function more than normal, by artificially keeping it filled, \r\nits thin wall of smooth muscle develops into a thick wall of striated \r\nmuscle that rhythmically contracts, like the heart. If a tadpole is \r\ngiven a vegetarian diet, the absorptive surface of its digestive system \r\nwill develop to be twice the size of those that are fed meat. Pressure, \r\nstretching, and pulsation are among the signals that guide cells' differentiation. Very \r\nearly in the study of embryology it was noticed that the presence of \r\none tissue sometimes induced the differentiation of another kind, and \r\nalso that there were factors in embryonic tissues that would stimulate \r\ncell division generally, and others that could inhibit the growth of \r\na particular tissue type. Diffusable substances and light were among \r\nthe factors identified as growth regulators. Extracts \r\nof particular tissues were found to suppress the multiplication of cells \r\nin that type of tissue, in adult animals as well as in embryos. In the \r\n1960s, the tissue-specific inhibitors were called chalones. The \r\nbrain's development is governed by the presence in the organism of the \r\nbody part to which it corresponds, such as the eyes or legs. The number \r\nof cells in a particular part of the nervous system is governed by the \r\nquantity of nervous input, sensory or motor, that it receives. An enriched \r\nenvironment causes a bigger brain to grow. Sensory nerve stimulation \r\nof a particular region of the brain causes nerve cells to migrate to \r\nthat area (a process called neurobiotaxis; deBeers, 1927), but nerve \r\nstimulation also causes mitochondria to accumulate in stimulated areas. \r\nNerve activity has a trophic, sustaining influence on other organs, \r\nas well as on the brain. Nerve stimulation, like mechanical pressure \r\nor stretching, is an important signal for cellular differentiation. When \r\nstem cells or progenitor cells are called on to replace cells in an \r\norgan, they are said to be \"recruited\" by that organ, or to \r\n\"home\" to that organ, if they are coming from elsewhere. Traditionally, \r\nthe bone marrow has been considered to be the source of circulating \r\nstem cells, but it now appears that a variety of other less differentiated \r\ncells can be recruited when needed. Cells from the blood can repair \r\nthe endothelium of blood vessels, and endothelial cells can become mesenchymal \r\ncells, in the heart, for example. The \r\nstandard doctrine about cancer is that a tumor derives from a single \r\nmutant cell, but it has been known for a long time that different types \r\nof cell, such as phagocytes and mast cells, usually reside in tumors, \r\nand it is now becoming clear that tumors recruit cells, including apparently \r\nnormal cells, from other parts of the same organ. For example, a brain \r\ntumor of glial cells, a glioma, recruits glial cells from surrounding \r\nareas of the brain, in a process that's analogous to the embryological \r\nmovement of nerve cells to a center of excitation. Each tumor, in a \r\nsense, seems to be a center of excitation, and its fate seems to depend \r\non the nature of the cells that respond to its signals. To \r\naccommodate some of the newer facts about tumors, the cancer establishment \r\nhas begun speaking of \"the cancer stem cell\" as the real villain, \r\nthe origin of the tumor, while the bulk of the tumor is seen to be made \r\nup of defective cells that have a short life-span. But if we recognize \r\nthat tumors are recruiting cells from beyond their boundaries, this \r\nprocess would account for the growth and survival of a tumor even while \r\nmost of its cells are inert and dying, without invoking the invisible \r\ncancer stem cell. And this view, that it is the field which is defective \r\nrather than the cell, is consistent with the evidence which has been \r\naccumulating for 35 years that tumor cells, given the right environment, \r\ncan differentiate into healthy cells. (Hendrix, et al., 2007) Simply \r\nstretching an organ (Woo, et al., 2007) is stimulus enough to cause \r\nit to recruit cells from the bloodstream, and will probably stimulate \r\nmultiplication in its local resident cells, too. Every \"cancer \r\nfield\" probably begins as a healing process, and generally the \r\nhealing and regeneration are at least partially successful. When \r\nan organ--the brain, heart, liver, or a blood vessel--is inflamed or \r\nsuffering from an insufficient blood supply, stem cells introduced into \r\nthe blood will migrate specifically to that organ. Organ \r\nspecific materials (chalones) are known to circulate in the blood, inhibiting \r\ncell division in cells typical to that organ, but it also seems that \r\norgan specific materials are secreted by a damaged organ, that help \r\nto prepare stem cells for their migration into that organ. When undifferentiated \r\ncells are cultured with serum from a person with liver failure, they \r\nbegin to differentiate into liver cells. It \r\nis still common to speak of each organ as having a \"clonal origin\" \r\nin the differentiating embryo, as a simple expansion of a certain embryonic \r\nanlage. The implication of this way of thinking is that differentiation \r\nisdeterminationin an irreversible sense. This is another case \r\nof medical ideas being based on images of fixed histological material. \r\nNormal cells, including nerve and muscle cells, can change type, with \r\nconnective tissue cells becoming nerve cells, nerve cells becoming muscle \r\nand fiber cells, fat, fiber, and muscle cells redifferentiating, for \r\nexample. Cell \r\nmovements in solid tissues aren't limited to the short distances between \r\ncapillaries and the tissues nourished by those capillaries, rather, \r\ncells can migrate much greater distances, without entering the bloodstream. \r\nThe speed of a single cell moving by ameboid motion can be measured \r\nby watching cells on a glass slide as they move toward food, or by watching \r\ncells of the slime mold Dictyostelium when they are aggregating, or \r\nby watching the pigment cells in and around moles or melanomas, under \r\nthe influence of hormones. At body temperature, a single cell can crawl \r\nabout an inch per day. Waves or spots of brown pigment can be seen migrating \r\nthrough the skin away from a mole, preceding the disintegration of the \r\nmole under the influence of progesterone or DHEA. Under ordinary conditions, \r\npigment cells can sometimes be seen migrating into depigmented areas \r\nof skin, during the recovery of an area affected by vitiligo. These \r\norganized movements of masses of cells happen to be easy to see, but \r\nthere is evidence that other types of cell can reconstruct tissues by \r\ntheir ameboid movements, when circumstances are right. Tumors or tissue \r\nabnormalities can appear or disappear with a suddenness that seems impossible \r\nto people who have studied only fixed tissue preparations. Stimulation \r\nis anabolic, building tissue, when the organism is adapting to the stimulation. \r\nUnused structures in cells and tissues are always being recycled by \r\nmetabolic processes. When tissues are injured and become unable to function, \r\nsome of their substances stimulate the growth of replacement cells. Some \r\ntypes of injury or irritation can activate regenerative processes. A \r\ndermatology journal described the case of an old man who had been bald \r\nfor many years who fell head-first into his fireplace. As his burned \r\nscalp healed, new hair grew. In the U.S., experimenters (Ito, et al., \r\n2007) have found that injuring the skin of mice stimulates the formation \r\nof stem cells that are able to become hair follicle cells, supporting \r\nthe regeneration of cells that had been absent. A brief exposure to \r\nestrogen, and other stress related signals (nitric oxide, endorphin, \r\nprostaglandins) can initiate stem cell proliferation. In \r\nthe years after the first world war, Vladimir Filatov, who developed \r\ntechniques of reconstructive surgery, including corneal transplants, \r\nfound that cold storage of tissues (for example, corneas from cadavers) \r\ncaused them to function better than fresh tissues, and he found that \r\nthese stressed tissues would often spread a healing influence out into \r\nthe surrounding tissues. Extracts of stressed tissues produced similar \r\neffects. L.V. \r\nPolezhaev began studying the regenerative capacities of mammals in the \r\nlate 1940s, and his work showed that processes similar to embryonic \r\ninduction are involved in the organism's responses to damaged tissues. \r\nFor example, when a piece of killed muscle tissue is enclosed in a capsule \r\n(\"diffusion chamber\") that permits molecules, but no cells, \r\nto diffuse through it, and implanted subcutaneously, it had no inductive \r\neffect on surrounding cells. But when the pores of the capsule allowed \r\ncells to enter, skeletal muscle formed where the dead tissue had been, \r\nand tissue resembling heart muscle formed outside the capsule. Phagocytosis \r\nhad been essential for the induction to occur. Macrophages \r\nare ordinarily thought of as \"antigen-presenting cells\" that \r\nhelp to activate the specific immune responses. But apparently phagocytosis \r\nis involved in the replacement of damaged tissues, by recruiting or \r\ninducing the differentiation of replacement cells. The phagocytosis \r\nfunction isn't limited to the blood cells commonly called phagocytes; \r\neven nerve cells can ingest particles and fragments of damaged tissues. Many \r\nfactors regulate the process of phagocytosis. Stress and lipid peroxidation \r\ndecrease phagocytosis (Izgüt-Uysal, et al., 2004), and also damage \r\nmitochondria and inhibit cell renewal. Unsaturated \r\nfatty acids inhibit phagocytosis (Guimaraes, et al., 1991, 1992; Costa \r\nRosa, et al., 1996; Virella, et al., 1989; Akamatsu, et al., 1990), \r\nand suppress mitochondrial function (Gomes, et al., 2006).  Dietary \r\nrestriction activates phagocytosis (Moriguchi, et al., 1989), suggesting \r\nthat normal diets contain suppressive materials. Subnormal \r\ntemperatures cause a shift from phagocytosis to inflammation. Light, \r\nespecially the red light which penetrates easily into tissues, activates \r\nthe formation of new cells as well as their differentiation. It affects \r\nenergy production, increasing the formation of mitochondria, and the \r\nactivity of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes. Red light accelerates \r\nwound healing, and improves the quality of the scar, reducing the amount \r\nof fibrosis. The daily cycling between darkness and light is probably \r\nan important factor in regulating the birth and differentiation of cells. Darkness \r\nsuppresses mitochondrial function, and light activates it. Prolonged \r\ndarkness increases cortisol, and cortisol (which makes cells more susceptible \r\nto excitotoxic death) inhibits stem cell proliferation (Li, et al., \r\n2006; Liu, et al., 2003). Neurogenesis is suppressed by stress, and \r\nincreased by spontaneous activity, and has a circadian rhythm. Aging \r\nand depression both involve a diminished ability to rhythmically lower \r\nthe production of cortisol. Cell renewal requires a rhythmic decrease \r\nin the exposure to cortisol.. In \r\nthe spring, with increased day length, the brains of song-birds grow, \r\nwith an increased proliferation of cells in the part of the brain involved \r\nin singing. The production of progesterone increases in most animals \r\nin the spring, and it is the main hormone responsible for the birds' \r\nbrain growth. Progesterone \r\nand its metabolites protect brain cells against injury, and improve \r\nthe brain's ability to recover after traumatic injury (Brinton and Wang, \r\n2006). In the 1960s, Marion Diamond's group showed that environmental \r\nenrichment, or progesterone, caused brains to grow larger, and that \r\nthese changes were passed on to descendants in a cumulative, increasing \r\nway. This suggests that the factors that promote neurogenesis also cause \r\nchanges in the apparatus of reproduction and inheritance, that support \r\nthe development of the brain--probably including the methylation system, \r\nwhich is involved in regulating genes, and also mood and behavior. Women's \r\nmonthly cycles, in which a brief estrogen dominance is followed by sustained \r\nexposure to progesterone, are probably an important factor in the renewal \r\nof the cells of the brain and other organs, as well as those of the \r\nreproductive organs. The daily rhythms of hormones and metabolism are \r\nknown to be involved in the regulation of cell renewal. Environmental \r\nenrichment, learning, high altitude, and thyroid hormone promote the \r\nformation of new mitochondria, and stimulate stem cell proliferation. \r\nAt least in some laboratories, 20% oxygen, approximately the amount \r\nas in the atmosphere, suppresses the proliferation of stem cells (He, \r\net al., 2007). This was the unphysiologically high concentration of \r\noxygen used in Hayflick's cell cultures. At high altitudes, where tissues \r\nare exposed to less oxygen, and more carbon dioxide, there is a lower \r\nincidence of all the degenerative diseases, including cancer, heart \r\ndisease, and dementia. Improved cellular energy production and more \r\nactive renewal of cells would probably account for those differences. For \r\nCrick, the idea of a diffusion gradient to explain embryonic development \r\nwas simply an extension of his reductionist orientation, in which diffusing \r\nmolecules induced or inhibited bacterial genes, and in which genes controlled \r\ncells. For people with that orientation, the adaptive mutations described \r\nby Carl Lindegren, and later by John Cairns, or even the stress-induced \r\nvariability described by Lysenko, Strong, and McClintock, were heretical. \r\nPolezhaev's demonstration that cells could do something that molecular \r\ndiffusion didn't do, threatened to take biology away from the reductionists. \r\nIf the organism's adaptation to the environment involves changing its \r\nown genes, Crick's paradigm fails. Crick's \r\nCentral Dogma, derived from the ideology that produced Weismann's Barrier, \r\nhas been invoked by generations of professors who wanted to deny the \r\npossibility of adaptive tissue renewal and regeneration. Without the \r\ndogma, new ideas about aging and disease will be needed. If somatic \r\ncells can adjust their genes, and if they can also differentiate into \r\nnew eggs and sperms, new ideas about inheritance of acquired traits \r\nwill be needed. The \r\nreplacement of injured cells means that mutations need not accumulate. \r\nCell renewal with elimination of mutant cells has been observed in sun-damaged \r\nskin simply by stopping the damage, and mitochondria with damaged DNA \r\ncan be replaced by healthy mitochondria simply by doing the right kind \r\nof exercise. The \r\nregulation of cell renewal probably involves all of the processes of \r\nlife, but there are a few simple, interacting factors that suppress \r\nrenewal. The accumulation of polyunsaturated fats, interacting with \r\na high concentration of oxygen, damages mitochondria, and causes a chronic \r\nexcessive exposure to cortisol. With mitochondrial damage, cells are \r\nunable to produce the progesterone needed to oppose cortisol and to \r\nprotect cells. Choosing \r\nthe right foods, the right atmosphere, the right mental and physical \r\nactivities, and finding the optimal rhythms of light, darkness, and \r\nactivity, can begin to alter the streaming renewal of cells in all the \r\norgans. Designing a more perfect environment is going to be much simpler \r\nthan the schemes of the genetic engineers. Cell \r\nrenewal is a factor in all aspects of health and disease, not just in \r\naging and the degenerative diseases. Many people are doing valid research \r\nrelating to cell renewal and regeneration, but its usefulness is seriously \r\nlimited by cultural and commercial constraints. By recovering some of \r\nour suppressed traditional culture, I think regenerative therapies can \r\nbe developed quickly, by identifying and eliminating as far as possible \r\nthe main factors that interfere with tissue renewal. Science \r\ngrew up in the highly authoritarian cultures of western Europe, and \r\neven as it contributed to cultural change, it kept an authoritarian \r\nmystique. Any culture functions as a system of definitions of reality \r\nand the limits of possibility, and to a great extent the \"laws \r\nof nature\" are decreed so that they will harmonize with the recognized \r\nlaws of society. The \r\npractical success of Newton's \"laws\" of motion when they were \r\napplied to ballistics and \"rocket science\" has led many people \r\nto value calculation, based on those laws, over evidence. In biology, \r\nthe idea that an organism is \"the information it contains in its \r\nDNA blueprint\" is an extention of this. The organism is turned \r\ninto something like a deductive expression of the law of DNA. This attitude \r\nhas been disastrous. The \r\nold feudal idea of a divine and stable social organization was applied \r\nby some people to their idea of biological organization, in which each \r\ncell (ruled by its nucleus) had its ordained place in the organism, \r\nwith the brain and the \"master gland,\" the pituitary, ruling \r\nthe subordinate organs, tissues, and cells. \"Anatomy\" was \r\ntaught from dead specimens, microscope slides, and illustrations in \r\nbooks. Most biologists' thoughts about cells in organisms reflect the \r\nstatic imagery of their instruction. (\"The histological image \r\nof these tissues actually reflects an instantaneous picture of cells \r\nin a continuous flux.\"Zajicek, 1981.) When \r\na person has playful and observant interactions with natural things, \r\nboth regularities and irregularities will be noticed, and in trying \r\nto understand those events, the richness of the experience will suggest \r\nan expansive range of possibilities. Perception and experimentation \r\nlead to understandings that are independent of culture and tradition. But \r\nthe mystique of science easily imposes itself, and distracts our attention \r\nfrom direct interactions with things. As we learn to operate lab instruments, \r\nwe are taught the kinds of results that can be expected, and the concepts \r\nthat will explain and predict the results of our operations. Science, \r\nas we learn about it in schools and the mass media, is mostly a set \r\nof catechisms. Our \r\ntheories about organisms inform our experiments with cells or tissues \r\nthat have been isolated from those organisms. The conditions for growing \r\ncells in dishes are thought of as \"physiological,\" in relation \r\nto the solution's \"physiological osmolarity,\" \"physiological \r\npH,\" nutrients, oxygenation, temperature, pressure, etc. But these \r\nconcepts of what is physiological derive from the monolithic ideology \r\nof the doctrinaire, and often fraudulent, mainstream of biological science. The \r\ncatechismic nature of science has led people to expect some \"break-throughs\" \r\n\r\nto occur in certain areas, and as authoritarian science has grown into \r\n\"big science\" managed by corporations and governments, those \r\nbreak-throughs are generally expected to be produced by the newest and \r\nmost expensive developments of \"high technology.\" But \r\nlooking closely at the real events and processes in the sciences in \r\nthe last couple of centuries, it turns out that useful advances have \r\nbeen produced mainly by breaking away from authoritarian doctrines, \r\nto return to common sense and relatively simple direct observations. Although \r\npeople were cloning animals in the 1960s, it was still widely taught \r\nthat it was impossible. The students of the professors who taught that \r\nit was impossible are now saying that it requires high technology and \r\nnew research. For \r\nthe last 100 years the most authoritative view in biology has been that \r\nthere are no stem cells in adults, that brains, hearts, pancreases and \r\noocytes are absolutely incapable of regeneration. But now, people seem \r\nto be finding stem cells wherever they look, but there is a mystique \r\nof high technology involved in finding and using them. Whether \r\nit's deliberate or not, the emphasis on stem cell technology has the \r\nfunction of directing attention away from traditional knowledge, the \r\nway allopathic medicine has de-emphasized the intrinsic ability of people \r\nto recover from disease. This \r\nresembles the way that the Mendel-Morgan gene doctrine was used to suppress \r\nthe knowledge gained from centuries of experience of plant and animal \r\nbreeders, and to belittle the discoveries of Luther Burbank, Paul Kammerer, \r\nTrofim Lysenko, and Barbara McClintock. The same type of biochemical \r\nprocess that caused the hereditary changes those researchers studied \r\nare involved in the differentiation and dedifferentiation of stem cells \r\nthat regulate healing and regeneration. In \r\nthe 1940s, even children discussed the biological discoveries of the \r\n1920s and 1930s, the work in regeneration and adaptation, parthenogenesis, \r\nand immortalization. The ideas of J. Loeb, T. Boveri, A. Gurwitsch, \r\nJ. Needham, C.M. Child, A. Carrel, et al., had become part of the general \r\nculture. But \r\nthat real biology was killed by a consortium of industry and government \r\nthat began a little before the second world war. In 1940, the government \r\nwas supporting research in chemical and biological warfare, and with \r\nthe Manhattan Project the role of government became so large that all \r\nof the major research universities were affected. Shortly after the \r\nwar, many researchers from the Manhattan Project were redeployed into \r\n\"molecular genetics,\" where the engineering attitude was applied \r\nto organisms. The \r\nsimplistic genetic dogmas were compatible with the reductionist engineering \r\napproach to the organism. The role of the government assured that the \r\nuniversities would subscribe to the basic scientific agenda. The atmosphere \r\nof that time was described by Carl Lindegren as \"The Cold War in \r\nBiology\" (1966). The \r\ndisappearance of the field concept in developmental biology was one \r\nof the strangest events in the history of science. It didn't just fade \r\naway, it was \"disappeared,\" in a massive undertaking of social \r\nengineering. In its absence, stem cells will seem to be a profitable \r\ntechnological marvel, rather than a universal life function, with a \r\ncentral role in everything we are and everything we do and can become. Many \r\npeople have tried to explain aging as a loss of cells, resulting from \r\nan intrinsic inability of any cell other than a germ cell to multiply \r\nmore than a certain number of times. More than 40 years ago Leonard \r\nHayflick popularized this doctrine in its most extreme form, saying \r\nthat no cell can divide more than 50 times unless it is converted into \r\na cancer cell. He and his followers claimed that they had explained \r\nwhy organisms must age and die. At the moment the ovum is fertilized, \r\nthe clock starts ticking for the essentially mortal somatic cells. In \r\n1970, it was being seriously proposed that memory was produced by the \r\ndeath of brain cells, in a manner analogous to the holes punched in \r\ncards to enter data into computers. The cultural dogma made it impossible \r\nto consider that learning could be associated with the birth of new \r\ncells in the adult brain. With \r\nthe announcement in 1997 of the cloning of the sheep Dolly from a somatic \r\ncell taken from a 6 year old sheep, there was renewed interest in the \r\nidea made famous by Alexis Carrel that all cells are potentially immortal, \r\nand in the possibility of preserving the vitality of human cells. Within \r\na few months, Hayflick began reminding the public that \"In the \r\nearly 1960's we overthrew this dogma after finding that normal cells \r\ndo have a finite replicative capacity.\" (\"During the first \r\nhalf of this century it was believed that because cultured normal cells \r\nwere immortal, aging must be caused by extra-cellular events.\") \r\nThe way Hayflick \"overthrew\" more than 35 years of work at \r\nthe Rockefeller Institute was by growing one type of cell, a lung fibroblast, \r\nin culture dishes, and finding that the cultures deteriorated quickly. To \r\ndraw global conclusions about an organism's development and aging from \r\nthe degenerative processes seen in a single type of cell, grown in isolation \r\nfrom all normal stimuli, would have been treated as nothing but wild \r\nspeculation, except that it occurred within a culture that needed it. \r\nNo aspect of Hayflick's cell culture system could properly be called \r\nphysiological. Other \r\nresearchers, simply by changing a single factor, caused great increases \r\nin the longevity of the cultured cells. Simply using a lower, more natural \r\noxygen concentration, the cells were able to undergo 20 more divisions. \r\nJust by adding niacin, 30 more divisions; vitamin E, 70 more divisions. \r\nExcess oxygen is a poison requiring constant adaptation. Hayflick \r\nalso published the observation that, while the cells kept in dishes \r\nat approximately body temperature deteriorated, cells kept frozen in \r\nliquid nitrogen didn't deteriorate, and he concluded that \"time\" \r\nwasn't the cause of aging. When I read his comments about the frozen \r\ncells, I wondered how anyone of normal intelligence could make such \r\nstupid statements. Since then, facts that came out because of the Freedom \r\nof Information Act, cause me to believe that a financial motive guided \r\nhis thoughts about his cultured fibroblasts. Hayflick \r\nand his followers have been attacking the idea of anti-aging medicine \r\nas quackery. But he is closely involved with the Geron corporation, \r\nwhich proposes that genetic alterations relating to telomeres may be \r\nable to cure cancer and prevent aging. Their claims were reported by \r\nCNN as \"Scientists discover cellular 'fountain of youth'.\" The \r\n\"wear and tear\" doctrine of aging that derived from the ideology \r\nof the gene was reinforced and renewed by Hayflick's cell culture observations, \r\nand it continued to rule the universities and popular culture. But \r\ndetailed investigation of skin cell growth showed that cells in the \r\nlower layer of the skin divide at least 10,000 times in a normal lifetime, \r\nand similar processes occur in the lining of the intestine. The endometrium \r\nand other highly renewable tissues just as obviously violated Hayflick's \r\nlimit. Transplantation experiments showed that pieces of mammary tissue \r\nor skin tissue could survive through ten normal lifetimes of experimental \r\nanimals without suffering the effects of aging. Even \r\nthe liver and adrenal gland are now known to be continuously renewed \r\nby \"cell streaming,\" though at a slower rate than the skin, \r\nconjunctiva, and intestine. Neurogenesis in the brain is now not only \r\nwidely accepted, it is even proposed as a mechanism to explain the therapeutic \r\neffects of antidepressants (Santarelli, et al., 2003). August \r\nWeismann's most influential doctrine said that \"somatic cells are \r\nmortal, only the germline cells are immortal,\" but he based the \r\ndoctrine on his mistaken belief that only the \"germline\" cells \r\ncontained all the genes of the organism. In 1885, to \"refute\" \r\nDarwin's belief that acquired traits could be inherited, he promulgated \r\nan absolute \"barrier\" between \"germline\" and \"soma,\" \r\n\r\nand invented facts to show that hereditary information can flow only \r\nfrom the germline to the somatic cells, and not the other direction. \r\nShortly after DNA became popular in the 1950s as \"the genetic material,\" \r\nWeismann's barrier was restated as the Central Dogma of molecular genetics, \r\nthat information flows only from DNA to RNA to protein, and never the \r\nother direction. It \r\nwas only in 2003, after the reality of cloning was widely recognized, \r\nthat a few experimenters began to investigate the origin of \"germline\" \r\ncells in the ovary, and to discover that they derive from somatic cells \r\n(Johnson, et al., 2004). With this discovery, the ancient knowledge \r\nthat a twig (klon, in Greek) cut from a tree could grow into \r\na whole tree, bearing fruit and viable seeds, was readmitted to general \r\nbiology, and the Weismann barrier was seen to be an illusion. Millions \r\nof people have \"explained\" female reproductive aging as the \r\nconsequence of the ovary \"running out of eggs.\" Innumerable \r\npublications purported to show the exact ways in which that process \r\noccurs, following the Weismann doctrine. But now that it is clear that \r\nadult ovaries can give birth to new oocytes, a new explanation for female \r\nreproductive aging is needed. It is likely that the same factors that \r\ncause female reproductive aging also cause aging of other systems and \r\norgans and tissues, and that those factors are extrinsic to the cells \r\nthemselves, as Alexis Carrel and others demonstrated long ago. This \r\nis a way of saying that all cells are potential stem cells. The \"niche\" \r\n\r\nin which new cells are born in the streaming organism, and the processes \r\nby which damaged cells are removed, are physiological issues that can \r\nbe illuminated by the idea of a morphogenetic field. When \r\nthe post-war genetic engineers took over biological research, the idea \r\nof a biophysical field was totally abandoned, but after about 15 years, \r\nit became necessary to think of problems beyond those existing within \r\na single bacterium, namely, the problem of how an ovum becomes and embryo. \r\nFrancis Crick, of DNA fame, who was educated as a physicist, revived \r\n(without a meaningful historical context) the idea of a diffusion gradient \r\nas a simple integrating factor that wouldn't be too offensive to the \r\nreductionists. But for events far beyond the scale of the egg's internal \r\nstructure, for example to explain how a nerve axon can travel a very \r\nlong distance to innervate exactly the right kind of cell, the diffusion \r\nof molecules loses its simplicity and plausibility. (Early in the history \r\nof experimental embryology, it was observed that electrical fields affect \r\nthe direction of growth of nerve fibers.) C. \r\nM. Child saw a gradient of metabolic activity as an essential component \r\nof the morphogenetic field. This kind of gradient doesn't deny the existence \r\nof diffusion gradients, or other physical components of a field. Electrical \r\nand osmotic (and electro-osmotic) events are generated by metabolism, \r\nand affect other factors, including pH, oxidation and reduction, cell \r\nmotility and cell shape, ionic selectivity and other types of cellular \r\nselectivity and specificity. Gradients of DNA methylation exist, and \r\naffect the expression of inherited information. Methylation \r\ndecreases the expression of particular genes, and during the differention \r\nof cells in the development of an embryo, genes are methylated and demethylated \r\nas the cell adapts to produce the proteins that are involved in the \r\nstructure and function of a particular tissue. Methylation (which increases \r\na molecule's affinity for fats) is a widespread process in cells, and \r\nfor example regulates cellular excitability. It is affected by diet \r\nand a variety of stresses. DNA \r\nmethylation patterns are normally fairly stable, and can help to account \r\nfor the transgenerational transmission of acquired adaptations, and \r\nfor neonatal imprinting that can last a lifetime. But with injury, stress, \r\nand aging, the methylation patterns of differentiated tissues can be \r\nchanged, contributing to the development of tumors, or to the loss of \r\ncellular functions. Even learning can change the methylation of specific \r\ngenes. Duringin vitroculture, the enzymes of gene methylation \r\nare known to be increased, relative to their normal activity (Wang, \r\net al., 2005). The \r\nphenomenon of \"gene\" methylation in response to environmental \r\nand metabolic conditions may eventually lead to the extinction of the \r\ndoctrine that \"cells are controlled by their genes.\" During \r\nsuccessful adaptation to stress, cells make adjustments to their metabolic \r\nsystems (for example with a holistic change of the degree of phosphorylation, \r\nwhich increases molecules' affinity for water), and their metabolic \r\nprocesses can contribute to changes in their state of differentiation. \r\nSome changes may lead to successful adaptation (for example by producing \r\nbiogenic stimulators that stimulate cell functioning and regeneration), \r\nothers to failed adaptation. Even the decomposition of cells can release \r\nsubstances that contribute to the adaptation of surrounding cells, for \r\nexample when sphingosines stimulate the production of stem cells. DNA \r\nmethylation is just one relatively stable event that occurs in relation \r\nto a metabolic field.  Modifications of histones (regulatory proteins \r\nin chromosomes, which are acetylated as well as methylated) and structural-contractile \r\nfilaments also contribute to the differentiation of cells, but the pattern \r\nof DNA methylation seems to guide the methylation of histones and the \r\nstructure of the chromosomes (Nan, et al., 1998). Steroids \r\nand phospholipids, neurotransmitters and endorphins, ATP, GTP, other \r\nphosphates, retinoids, NO and CO2--many materials and processes participate \r\nin the coherence of the living state, the living substance. Carbon dioxide, \r\nfor example, by binding to lysine amino groups in the histones, will \r\ninfluence their methylation.  Carbon dioxide is likely to affect \r\nother amino groups in the chromosomes. The \r\nnumber and arrangement of mitochondria is an important factor in producing \r\nand maintaining the metabolic gradients. Things that decrease mitochondrial \r\nenergy production--nitric oxide, histamine, cytokines, cortisol--increase \r\nDNA methylation. Decreased gene expression is associated with reduced \r\nrespiratory energy. It seems reasonable to guess that increased gene \r\nexpression would demand increased availability of energy. As \r\nan ovum differentiates into an organism, cells become progressively \r\nmore specialized, inhibiting the expression of many genes. Less energy \r\nis needed by stably functioning cells, than by actively adapting cells. \r\nA.I. Zotin described the process of maturing and differentiating as \r\na decrease of entropy, an increase of order accompanying a decreased \r\nenergy expenditure. The entropic egg develops into a less entropic embryo \r\nwith a great expenditure of energy. The \r\npartially differentiated stem cell doesn't go through all the stages \r\nof development, but it does expend energy intensely as it matures. The \r\nrestoration of energy is one requirement for the activation of regeneration. \r\nWhen a hormone such as noradrenaline or insulin causes a stem cell to \r\ndifferentiate in vitro, it causes new mitochondria to form. This is \r\nsomewhat analogous to the insertion of mitochondria into the ripening \r\noocyte, by the nurse cells that surround it. The conditionally decreased \r\nentropy of maturation is reversed, and when sufficient respiratory energy \r\nis available, the renewed and refreshed cell will be able to renew an \r\nappropriate degree of differentiation. When \r\nsimple organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, or protozoa are stressed, \r\nfor example by the absence of nutrients or the presence of toxins, they \r\nslow their metabolism, and suppress the expression of genes, increasing \r\nthe methylation of DNA, to form resistant and quiescent spores. Our \r\ndifferentiated state doesn't go to the metabolic extreme seen in sporulation, \r\nbut it's useful to look at maturity and aging in this context, because \r\nit suggests that the wrong kind of stress decreases the ability of the \r\norganism to adapt, by processes resembling those in the spore-forming \r\norganisms. Charles \r\nVacanti, who has grown cartilage from cells taken from 100 year old \r\nhuman cartilage, believes our tissues contain \"spore cells,\" \r\nvery small cells with slow metabolism and extreme resistance to heat, \r\ncold, and starvation. If \r\nthe slowed metabolism of aging, like that of sporulating cells, is produced \r\nby a certain kind of stress that lowers cellular energy and functions, \r\nit might be useful to think of the other stages of the stress reaction \r\nin relation to the production of stem cells. Selye divided stress into \r\na first stage of shock, followed by a prolonged adaptation, which could \r\nsometimes end in exhaustion. If the maturity of differentiated functioning \r\nis equivalent to the adaptation phase, and cellular decline and disintegration \r\nis the exhaustion phase, then the shock-like reaction would correspond \r\nto the birth of new stem cells. Selye \r\ndescribed estrogen's effects as equivalent to the shock-phase of stress. \r\nEstrogen's basic action is to make oxygen unavailable, lowering the \r\noxygen tension of the tissues, locally and temporarily. Like nitric \r\noxide, which is produced by estrogenic stimulation, estrogen interferes \r\nwith energy production, so if its stimulation is prolonged, cells are \r\ndamaged or killed, rather than being stimulated to regenerate. Extrinsic \r\nfactors elicit renewal, the way stress can elicit adaptation. While \r\naging cells can't use the oxygen that is present, a scarcity of oxygen \r\ncan serve as a stimulus to maximize the respiratory systems. Brief oxygen \r\ndeprivation excites a cell, causes it to swell, and to begin to divide. Oxygen \r\ndeprivation, as in the normally hypoxic bone marrow, stimulates the \r\nformation of stem cells, as well as the biogenesis of mitochondria. \r\nAs the newly formed cells, with abundant mitochondria, get adequate \r\noxygen, they begin differentiation. Form, \r\nbased on cellular differentiation, follows function--a vein transplanted \r\ninto an artery develops anatomically into an artery, a colon attached \r\ndirectly to the anus becomes a new rectum with its appropriate innervation, \r\na broken bone restructures to form a normal bone. If the bladder is \r\nforced to function more than normal, by artificially keeping it filled, \r\nits thin wall of smooth muscle develops into a thick wall of striated \r\nmuscle that rhythmically contracts, like the heart. If a tadpole is \r\ngiven a vegetarian diet, the absorptive surface of its digestive system \r\nwill develop to be twice the size of those that are fed meat. Pressure, \r\nstretching, and pulsation are among the signals that guide cells' differentiation. Very \r\nearly in the study of embryology it was noticed that the presence of \r\none tissue sometimes induced the differentiation of another kind, and \r\nalso that there were factors in embryonic tissues that would stimulate \r\ncell division generally, and others that could inhibit the growth of \r\na particular tissue type. Diffusable substances and light were among \r\nthe factors identified as growth regulators. Extracts \r\nof particular tissues were found to suppress the multiplication of cells \r\nin that type of tissue, in adult animals as well as in embryos. In the \r\n1960s, the tissue-specific inhibitors were called chalones. The \r\nbrain's development is governed by the presence in the organism of the \r\nbody part to which it corresponds, such as the eyes or legs. The number \r\nof cells in a particular part of the nervous system is governed by the \r\nquantity of nervous input, sensory or motor, that it receives. An enriched \r\nenvironment causes a bigger brain to grow. Sensory nerve stimulation \r\nof a particular region of the brain causes nerve cells to migrate to \r\nthat area (a process called neurobiotaxis; deBeers, 1927), but nerve \r\nstimulation also causes mitochondria to accumulate in stimulated areas. \r\nNerve activity has a trophic, sustaining influence on other organs, \r\nas well as on the brain. Nerve stimulation, like mechanical pressure \r\nor stretching, is an important signal for cellular differentiation. When \r\nstem cells or progenitor cells are called on to replace cells in an \r\norgan, they are said to be \"recruited\" by that organ, or to \r\n\"home\" to that organ, if they are coming from elsewhere. Traditionally, \r\nthe bone marrow has been considered to be the source of circulating \r\nstem cells, but it now appears that a variety of other less differentiated \r\ncells can be recruited when needed. Cells from the blood can repair \r\nthe endothelium of blood vessels, and endothelial cells can become mesenchymal \r\ncells, in the heart, for example. The \r\nstandard doctrine about cancer is that a tumor derives from a single \r\nmutant cell, but it has been known for a long time that different types \r\nof cell, such as phagocytes and mast cells, usually reside in tumors, \r\nand it is now becoming clear that tumors recruit cells, including apparently \r\nnormal cells, from other parts of the same organ. For example, a brain \r\ntumor of glial cells, a glioma, recruits glial cells from surrounding \r\nareas of the brain, in a process that's analogous to the embryological \r\nmovement of nerve cells to a center of excitation. Each tumor, in a \r\nsense, seems to be a center of excitation, and its fate seems to depend \r\non the nature of the cells that respond to its signals. To \r\naccommodate some of the newer facts about tumors, the cancer establishment \r\nhas begun speaking of \"the cancer stem cell\" as the real villain, \r\nthe origin of the tumor, while the bulk of the tumor is seen to be made \r\nup of defective cells that have a short life-span. But if we recognize \r\nthat tumors are recruiting cells from beyond their boundaries, this \r\nprocess would account for the growth and survival of a tumor even while \r\nmost of its cells are inert and dying, without invoking the invisible \r\ncancer stem cell. And this view, that it is the field which is defective \r\nrather than the cell, is consistent with the evidence which has been \r\naccumulating for 35 years that tumor cells, given the right environment, \r\ncan differentiate into healthy cells. (Hendrix, et al., 2007) Simply \r\nstretching an organ (Woo, et al., 2007) is stimulus enough to cause \r\nit to recruit cells from the bloodstream, and will probably stimulate \r\nmultiplication in its local resident cells, too. Every \"cancer \r\nfield\" probably begins as a healing process, and generally the \r\nhealing and regeneration are at least partially successful. When \r\nan organ--the brain, heart, liver, or a blood vessel--is inflamed or \r\nsuffering from an insufficient blood supply, stem cells introduced into \r\nthe blood will migrate specifically to that organ. Organ \r\nspecific materials (chalones) are known to circulate in the blood, inhibiting \r\ncell division in cells typical to that organ, but it also seems that \r\norgan specific materials are secreted by a damaged organ, that help \r\nto prepare stem cells for their migration into that organ. When undifferentiated \r\ncells are cultured with serum from a person with liver failure, they \r\nbegin to differentiate into liver cells. It \r\nis still common to speak of each organ as having a \"clonal origin\" \r\nin the differentiating embryo, as a simple expansion of a certain embryonic \r\nanlage. The implication of this way of thinking is that differentiation \r\nisdeterminationin an irreversible sense. This is another case \r\nof medical ideas being based on images of fixed histological material. \r\nNormal cells, including nerve and muscle cells, can change type, with \r\nconnective tissue cells becoming nerve cells, nerve cells becoming muscle \r\nand fiber cells, fat, fiber, and muscle cells redifferentiating, for \r\nexample. Cell \r\nmovements in solid tissues aren't limited to the short distances between \r\ncapillaries and the tissues nourished by those capillaries, rather, \r\ncells can migrate much greater distances, without entering the bloodstream. \r\nThe speed of a single cell moving by ameboid motion can be measured \r\nby watching cells on a glass slide as they move toward food, or by watching \r\ncells of the slime mold Dictyostelium when they are aggregating, or \r\nby watching the pigment cells in and around moles or melanomas, under \r\nthe influence of hormones. At body temperature, a single cell can crawl \r\nabout an inch per day. Waves or spots of brown pigment can be seen migrating \r\nthrough the skin away from a mole, preceding the disintegration of the \r\nmole under the influence of progesterone or DHEA. Under ordinary conditions, \r\npigment cells can sometimes be seen migrating into depigmented areas \r\nof skin, during the recovery of an area affected by vitiligo. These \r\norganized movements of masses of cells happen to be easy to see, but \r\nthere is evidence that other types of cell can reconstruct tissues by \r\ntheir ameboid movements, when circumstances are right. Tumors or tissue \r\nabnormalities can appear or disappear with a suddenness that seems impossible \r\nto people who have studied only fixed tissue preparations. Stimulation \r\nis anabolic, building tissue, when the organism is adapting to the stimulation. \r\nUnused structures in cells and tissues are always being recycled by \r\nmetabolic processes. When tissues are injured and become unable to function, \r\nsome of their substances stimulate the growth of replacement cells. Some \r\ntypes of injury or irritation can activate regenerative processes. A \r\ndermatology journal described the case of an old man who had been bald \r\nfor many years who fell head-first into his fireplace. As his burned \r\nscalp healed, new hair grew. In the U.S., experimenters (Ito, et al., \r\n2007) have found that injuring the skin of mice stimulates the formation \r\nof stem cells that are able to become hair follicle cells, supporting \r\nthe regeneration of cells that had been absent. A brief exposure to \r\nestrogen, and other stress related signals (nitric oxide, endorphin, \r\nprostaglandins) can initiate stem cell proliferation. In \r\nthe years after the first world war, Vladimir Filatov, who developed \r\ntechniques of reconstructive surgery, including corneal transplants, \r\nfound that cold storage of tissues (for example, corneas from cadavers) \r\ncaused them to function better than fresh tissues, and he found that \r\nthese stressed tissues would often spread a healing influence out into \r\nthe surrounding tissues. Extracts of stressed tissues produced similar \r\neffects. L.V. \r\nPolezhaev began studying the regenerative capacities of mammals in the \r\nlate 1940s, and his work showed that processes similar to embryonic \r\ninduction are involved in the organism's responses to damaged tissues. \r\nFor example, when a piece of killed muscle tissue is enclosed in a capsule \r\n(\"diffusion chamber\") that permits molecules, but no cells, \r\nto diffuse through it, and implanted subcutaneously, it had no inductive \r\neffect on surrounding cells. But when the pores of the capsule allowed \r\ncells to enter, skeletal muscle formed where the dead tissue had been, \r\nand tissue resembling heart muscle formed outside the capsule. Phagocytosis \r\nhad been essential for the induction to occur. Macrophages \r\nare ordinarily thought of as \"antigen-presenting cells\" that \r\nhelp to activate the specific immune responses. But apparently phagocytosis \r\nis involved in the replacement of damaged tissues, by recruiting or \r\ninducing the differentiation of replacement cells. The phagocytosis \r\nfunction isn't limited to the blood cells commonly called phagocytes; \r\neven nerve cells can ingest particles and fragments of damaged tissues. Many \r\nfactors regulate the process of phagocytosis. Stress and lipid peroxidation \r\ndecrease phagocytosis (Izgüt-Uysal, et al., 2004), and also damage \r\nmitochondria and inhibit cell renewal. Unsaturated \r\nfatty acids inhibit phagocytosis (Guimaraes, et al., 1991, 1992; Costa \r\nRosa, et al., 1996; Virella, et al., 1989; Akamatsu, et al., 1990), \r\nand suppress mitochondrial function (Gomes, et al., 2006).  Dietary \r\nrestriction activates phagocytosis (Moriguchi, et al., 1989), suggesting \r\nthat normal diets contain suppressive materials. Subnormal \r\ntemperatures cause a shift from phagocytosis to inflammation. Light, \r\nespecially the red light which penetrates easily into tissues, activates \r\nthe formation of new cells as well as their differentiation. It affects \r\nenergy production, increasing the formation of mitochondria, and the \r\nactivity of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes. Red light accelerates \r\nwound healing, and improves the quality of the scar, reducing the amount \r\nof fibrosis. The daily cycling between darkness and light is probably \r\nan important factor in regulating the birth and differentiation of cells. Darkness \r\nsuppresses mitochondrial function, and light activates it. Prolonged \r\ndarkness increases cortisol, and cortisol (which makes cells more susceptible \r\nto excitotoxic death) inhibits stem cell proliferation (Li, et al., \r\n2006; Liu, et al., 2003). Neurogenesis is suppressed by stress, and \r\nincreased by spontaneous activity, and has a circadian rhythm. Aging \r\nand depression both involve a diminished ability to rhythmically lower \r\nthe production of cortisol. Cell renewal requires a rhythmic decrease \r\nin the exposure to cortisol.. In \r\nthe spring, with increased day length, the brains of song-birds grow, \r\nwith an increased proliferation of cells in the part of the brain involved \r\nin singing. The production of progesterone increases in most animals \r\nin the spring, and it is the main hormone responsible for the birds' \r\nbrain growth. Progesterone \r\nand its metabolites protect brain cells against injury, and improve \r\nthe brain's ability to recover after traumatic injury (Brinton and Wang, \r\n2006). In the 1960s, Marion Diamond's group showed that environmental \r\nenrichment, or progesterone, caused brains to grow larger, and that \r\nthese changes were passed on to descendants in a cumulative, increasing \r\nway. This suggests that the factors that promote neurogenesis also cause \r\nchanges in the apparatus of reproduction and inheritance, that support \r\nthe development of the brain--probably including the methylation system, \r\nwhich is involved in regulating genes, and also mood and behavior. Women's \r\nmonthly cycles, in which a brief estrogen dominance is followed by sustained \r\nexposure to progesterone, are probably an important factor in the renewal \r\nof the cells of the brain and other organs, as well as those of the \r\nreproductive organs. The daily rhythms of hormones and metabolism are \r\nknown to be involved in the regulation of cell renewal. Environmental \r\nenrichment, learning, high altitude, and thyroid hormone promote the \r\nformation of new mitochondria, and stimulate stem cell proliferation. \r\nAt least in some laboratories, 20% oxygen, approximately the amount \r\nas in the atmosphere, suppresses the proliferation of stem cells (He, \r\net al., 2007). This was the unphysiologically high concentration of \r\noxygen used in Hayflick's cell cultures. At high altitudes, where tissues \r\nare exposed to less oxygen, and more carbon dioxide, there is a lower \r\nincidence of all the degenerative diseases, including cancer, heart \r\ndisease, and dementia. Improved cellular energy production and more \r\nactive renewal of cells would probably account for those differences. For \r\nCrick, the idea of a diffusion gradient to explain embryonic development \r\nwas simply an extension of his reductionist orientation, in which diffusing \r\nmolecules induced or inhibited bacterial genes, and in which genes controlled \r\ncells. For people with that orientation, the adaptive mutations described \r\nby Carl Lindegren, and later by John Cairns, or even the stress-induced \r\nvariability described by Lysenko, Strong, and McClintock, were heretical. \r\nPolezhaev's demonstration that cells could do something that molecular \r\ndiffusion didn't do, threatened to take biology away from the reductionists. \r\nIf the organism's adaptation to the environment involves changing its \r\nown genes, Crick's paradigm fails. Crick's \r\nCentral Dogma, derived from the ideology that produced Weismann's Barrier, \r\nhas been invoked by generations of professors who wanted to deny the \r\npossibility of adaptive tissue renewal and regeneration. Without the \r\ndogma, new ideas about aging and disease will be needed. If somatic \r\ncells can adjust their genes, and if they can also differentiate into \r\nnew eggs and sperms, new ideas about inheritance of acquired traits \r\nwill be needed. The \r\nreplacement of injured cells means that mutations need not accumulate. \r\nCell renewal with elimination of mutant cells has been observed in sun-damaged \r\nskin simply by stopping the damage, and mitochondria with damaged DNA \r\ncan be replaced by healthy mitochondria simply by doing the right kind \r\nof exercise. The \r\nregulation of cell renewal probably involves all of the processes of \r\nlife, but there are a few simple, interacting factors that suppress \r\nrenewal. The accumulation of polyunsaturated fats, interacting with \r\na high concentration of oxygen, damages mitochondria, and causes a chronic \r\nexcessive exposure to cortisol. With mitochondrial damage, cells are \r\nunable to produce the progesterone needed to oppose cortisol and to \r\nprotect cells. Choosing \r\nthe right foods, the right atmosphere, the right mental and physical \r\nactivities, and finding the optimal rhythms of light, darkness, and \r\nactivity, can begin to alter the streaming renewal of cells in all the \r\norgans. Designing a more perfect environment is going to be much simpler \r\nthan the schemes of the genetic engineers. Cell \r\nrenewal is a factor in all aspects of health and disease, not just in \r\naging and the degenerative diseases. Many people are doing valid research \r\nrelating to cell renewal and regeneration, but its usefulness is seriously \r\nlimited by cultural and commercial constraints. By recovering some of \r\nour suppressed traditional culture, I think regenerative therapies can \r\nbe developed quickly, by identifying and eliminating as far as possible \r\nthe main factors that interfere with tissue renewal. Science \r\ngrew up in the highly authoritarian cultures of western Europe, and \r\neven as it contributed to cultural change, it kept an authoritarian \r\nmystique. Any culture functions as a system of definitions of reality \r\nand the limits of possibility, and to a great extent the \"laws \r\nof nature\" are decreed so that they will harmonize with the recognized \r\nlaws of society. The \r\npractical success of Newton's \"laws\" of motion when they were \r\napplied to ballistics and \"rocket science\" has led many people \r\nto value calculation, based on those laws, over evidence. In biology, \r\nthe idea that an organism is \"the information it contains in its \r\nDNA blueprint\" is an extention of this. The organism is turned \r\ninto something like a deductive expression of the law of DNA. This attitude \r\nhas been disastrous. The \r\nold feudal idea of a divine and stable social organization was applied \r\nby some people to their idea of biological organization, in which each \r\ncell (ruled by its nucleus) had its ordained place in the organism, \r\nwith the brain and the \"master gland,\" the pituitary, ruling \r\nthe subordinate organs, tissues, and cells. \"Anatomy\" was \r\ntaught from dead specimens, microscope slides, and illustrations in \r\nbooks. Most biologists' thoughts about cells in organisms reflect the \r\nstatic imagery of their instruction. (\"The histological image \r\nof these tissues actually reflects an instantaneous picture of cells \r\nin a continuous flux.\"Zajicek, 1981.) When \r\na person has playful and observant interactions with natural things, \r\nboth regularities and irregularities will be noticed, and in trying \r\nto understand those events, the richness of the experience will suggest \r\nan expansive range of possibilities. Perception and experimentation \r\nlead to understandings that are independent of culture and tradition. But \r\nthe mystique of science easily imposes itself, and distracts our attention \r\nfrom direct interactions with things. As we learn to operate lab instruments, \r\nwe are taught the kinds of results that can be expected, and the concepts \r\nthat will explain and predict the results of our operations. Science, \r\nas we learn about it in schools and the mass media, is mostly a set \r\nof catechisms. Our \r\ntheories about organisms inform our experiments with cells or tissues \r\nthat have been isolated from those organisms. The conditions for growing \r\ncells in dishes are thought of as \"physiological,\" in relation \r\nto the solution's \"physiological osmolarity,\" \"physiological \r\npH,\" nutrients, oxygenation, temperature, pressure, etc. But these \r\nconcepts of what is physiological derive from the monolithic ideology \r\nof the doctrinaire, and often fraudulent, mainstream of biological science. The \r\ncatechismic nature of science has led people to expect some \"break-throughs\" \r\nto occur in certain areas, and as authoritarian science has grown into \r\n\"big science\" managed by corporations and governments, those \r\nbreak-throughs are generally expected to be produced by the newest and \r\nmost expensive developments of \"high technology.\" But \r\nlooking closely at the real events and processes in the sciences in \r\nthe last couple of centuries, it turns out that useful advances have \r\nbeen produced mainly by breaking away from authoritarian doctrines, \r\nto return to common sense and relatively simple direct observations. Although \r\npeople were cloning animals in the 1960s, it was still widely taught \r\nthat it was impossible. The students of the professors who taught that \r\nit was impossible are now saying that it requires high technology and \r\nnew research. For \r\nthe last 100 years the most authoritative view in biology has been that \r\nthere are no stem cells in adults, that brains, hearts, pancreases and \r\noocytes are absolutely incapable of regeneration. But now, people seem \r\nto be finding stem cells wherever they look, but there is a mystique \r\nof high technology involved in finding and using them. Whether \r\nit's deliberate or not, the emphasis on stem cell technology has the \r\nfunction of directing attention away from traditional knowledge, the \r\nway allopathic medicine has de-emphasized the intrinsic ability of people \r\nto recover from disease. This \r\nresembles the way that the Mendel-Morgan gene doctrine was used to suppress \r\nthe knowledge gained from centuries of experience of plant and animal \r\nbreeders, and to belittle the discoveries of Luther Burbank, Paul Kammerer, \r\nTrofim Lysenko, and Barbara McClintock. The same type of biochemical \r\nprocess that caused the hereditary changes those researchers studied \r\nare involved in the differentiation and dedifferentiation of stem cells \r\nthat regulate healing and regeneration. In \r\nthe 1940s, even children discussed the biological discoveries of the \r\n1920s and 1930s, the work in regeneration and adaptation, parthenogenesis, \r\nand immortalization. The ideas of J. Loeb, T. Boveri, A. Gurwitsch, \r\nJ. Needham, C.M. Child, A. Carrel, et al., had become part of the general \r\nculture. But \r\nthat real biology was killed by a consortium of industry and government \r\nthat began a little before the second world war. In 1940, the government \r\nwas supporting research in chemical and biological warfare, and with \r\nthe Manhattan Project the role of government became so large that all \r\nof the major research universities were affected. Shortly after the \r\nwar, many researchers from the Manhattan Project were redeployed into \r\n\"molecular genetics,\" where the engineering attitude was applied \r\nto organisms. The \r\nsimplistic genetic dogmas were compatible with the reductionist engineering \r\napproach to the organism. The role of the government assured that the \r\nuniversities would subscribe to the basic scientific agenda. The atmosphere \r\nof that time was described by Carl Lindegren as \"The Cold War in \r\nBiology\" (1966). The \r\ndisappearance of the field concept in developmental biology was one \r\nof the strangest events in the history of science. It didn't just fade \r\naway, it was \"disappeared,\" in a massive undertaking of social \r\nengineering. In its absence, stem cells will seem to be a profitable \r\ntechnological marvel, rather than a universal life function, with a \r\ncentral role in everything we are and everything we do and can become. Many \r\npeople have tried to explain aging as a loss of cells, resulting from \r\nan intrinsic inability of any cell other than a germ cell to multiply \r\nmore than a certain number of times. More than 40 years ago Leonard \r\nHayflick popularized this doctrine in its most extreme form, saying \r\nthat no cell can divide more than 50 times unless it is converted into \r\na cancer cell. He and his followers claimed that they had explained \r\nwhy organisms must age and die. At the moment the ovum is fertilized, \r\nthe clock starts ticking for the essentially mortal somatic cells. In \r\n1970, it was being seriously proposed that memory was produced by the \r\ndeath of brain cells, in a manner analogous to the holes punched in \r\ncards to enter data into computers. The cultural dogma made it impossible \r\nto consider that learning could be associated with the birth of new \r\ncells in the adult brain. With \r\nthe announcement in 1997 of the cloning of the sheep Dolly from a somatic \r\ncell taken from a 6 year old sheep, there was renewed interest in the \r\nidea made famous by Alexis Carrel that all cells are potentially immortal, \r\nand in the possibility of preserving the vitality of human cells. Within \r\na few months, Hayflick began reminding the public that \"In the \r\nearly 1960's we overthrew this dogma after finding that normal cells \r\ndo have a finite replicative capacity.\" (\"During the first \r\nhalf of this century it was believed that because cultured normal cells \r\nwere immortal, aging must be caused by extra-cellular events.\") \r\nThe way Hayflick \"overthrew\" more than 35 years of work at \r\nthe Rockefeller Institute was by growing one type of cell, a lung fibroblast, \r\nin culture dishes, and finding that the cultures deteriorated quickly. To \r\ndraw global conclusions about an organism's development and aging from \r\nthe degenerative processes seen in a single type of cell, grown in isolation \r\nfrom all normal stimuli, would have been treated as nothing but wild \r\nspeculation, except that it occurred within a culture that needed it. \r\nNo aspect of Hayflick's cell culture system could properly be called \r\nphysiological. Other \r\nresearchers, simply by changing a single factor, caused great increases \r\nin the longevity of the cultured cells. Simply using a lower, more natural \r\noxygen concentration, the cells were able to undergo 20 more divisions. \r\nJust by adding niacin, 30 more divisions; vitamin E, 70 more divisions. \r\nExcess oxygen is a poison requiring constant adaptation. Hayflick \r\nalso published the observation that, while the cells kept in dishes \r\nat approximately body temperature deteriorated, cells kept frozen in \r\nliquid nitrogen didn't deteriorate, and he concluded that \"time\" \r\nwasn't the cause of aging. When I read his comments about the frozen \r\ncells, I wondered how anyone of normal intelligence could make such \r\nstupid statements. Since then, facts that came out because of the Freedom \r\nof Information Act, cause me to believe that a financial motive guided \r\nhis thoughts about his cultured fibroblasts. Hayflick \r\nand his followers have been attacking the idea of anti-aging medicine \r\nas quackery. But he is closely involved with the Geron corporation, \r\nwhich proposes that genetic alterations relating to telomeres may be \r\nable to cure cancer and prevent aging. Their claims were reported by \r\nCNN as \"Scientists discover cellular 'fountain of youth'.\" The \r\n\"wear and tear\" doctrine of aging that derived from the ideology \r\nof the gene was reinforced and renewed by Hayflick's cell culture observations, \r\nand it continued to rule the universities and popular culture. But \r\ndetailed investigation of skin cell growth showed that cells in the \r\nlower layer of the skin divide at least 10,000 times in a normal lifetime, \r\nand similar processes occur in the lining of the intestine. The endometrium \r\nand other highly renewable tissues just as obviously violated Hayflick's \r\nlimit. Transplantation experiments showed that pieces of mammary tissue \r\nor skin tissue could survive through ten normal lifetimes of experimental \r\nanimals without suffering the effects of aging. Even \r\nthe liver and adrenal gland are now known to be continuously renewed \r\nby \"cell streaming,\" though at a slower rate than the skin, \r\nconjunctiva, and intestine. Neurogenesis in the brain is now not only \r\nwidely accepted, it is even proposed as a mechanism to explain the therapeutic \r\neffects of antidepressants (Santarelli, et al., 2003). August \r\nWeismann's most influential doctrine said that \"somatic cells are \r\nmortal, only the germline cells are immortal,\" but he based the \r\ndoctrine on his mistaken belief that only the \"germline\" cells \r\ncontained all the genes of the organism. In 1885, to \"refute\" \r\nDarwin's belief that acquired traits could be inherited, he promulgated \r\nan absolute \"barrier\" between \"germline\" and \"soma,\" \r\n\r\nand invented facts to show that hereditary information can flow only \r\nfrom the germline to the somatic cells, and not the other direction. \r\nShortly after DNA became popular in the 1950s as \"the genetic material,\" \r\nWeismann's barrier was restated as the Central Dogma of molecular genetics, \r\nthat information flows only from DNA to RNA to protein, and never the \r\nother direction. It \r\nwas only in 2003, after the reality of cloning was widely recognized, \r\nthat a few experimenters began to investigate the origin of \"germline\" \r\ncells in the ovary, and to discover that they derive from somatic cells \r\n(Johnson, et al., 2004). With this discovery, the ancient knowledge \r\nthat a twig (klon, in Greek) cut from a tree could grow into \r\na whole tree, bearing fruit and viable seeds, was readmitted to general \r\nbiology, and the Weismann barrier was seen to be an illusion. Millions \r\nof people have \"explained\" female reproductive aging as the \r\nconsequence of the ovary \"running out of eggs.\" Innumerable \r\npublications purported to show the exact ways in which that process \r\noccurs, following the Weismann doctrine. But now that it is clear that \r\nadult ovaries can give birth to new oocytes, a new explanation for female \r\nreproductive aging is needed. It is likely that the same factors that \r\ncause female reproductive aging also cause aging of other systems and \r\norgans and tissues, and that those factors are extrinsic to the cells \r\nthemselves, as Alexis Carrel and others demonstrated long ago. This \r\nis a way of saying that all cells are potential stem cells. The \"niche\" \r\n\r\nin which new cells are born in the streaming organism, and the processes \r\nby which damaged cells are removed, are physiological issues that can \r\nbe illuminated by the idea of a morphogenetic field. When \r\nthe post-war genetic engineers took over biological research, the idea \r\nof a biophysical field was totally abandoned, but after about 15 years, \r\nit became necessary to think of problems beyond those existing within \r\na single bacterium, namely, the problem of how an ovum becomes and embryo. \r\nFrancis Crick, of DNA fame, who was educated as a physicist, revived \r\n(without a meaningful historical context) the idea of a diffusion gradient \r\nas a simple integrating factor that wouldn't be too offensive to the \r\nreductionists. But for events far beyond the scale of the egg's internal \r\nstructure, for example to explain how a nerve axon can travel a very \r\nlong distance to innervate exactly the right kind of cell, the diffusion \r\nof molecules loses its simplicity and plausibility. (Early in the history \r\nof experimental embryology, it was observed that electrical fields affect \r\nthe direction of growth of nerve fibers.) C. \r\nM. Child saw a gradient of metabolic activity as an essential component \r\nof the morphogenetic field. This kind of gradient doesn't deny the existence \r\nof diffusion gradients, or other physical components of a field. Electrical \r\nand osmotic (and electro-osmotic) events are generated by metabolism, \r\nand affect other factors, including pH, oxidation and reduction, cell \r\nmotility and cell shape, ionic selectivity and other types of cellular \r\nselectivity and specificity. Gradients of DNA methylation exist, and \r\naffect the expression of inherited information. Methylation \r\ndecreases the expression of particular genes, and during the differention \r\nof cells in the development of an embryo, genes are methylated and demethylated \r\nas the cell adapts to produce the proteins that are involved in the \r\nstructure and function of a particular tissue. Methylation (which increases \r\na molecule's affinity for fats) is a widespread process in cells, and \r\nfor example regulates cellular excitability. It is affected by diet \r\nand a variety of stresses. DNA \r\nmethylation patterns are normally fairly stable, and can help to account \r\nfor the transgenerational transmission of acquired adaptations, and \r\nfor neonatal imprinting that can last a lifetime. But with injury, stress, \r\nand aging, the methylation patterns of differentiated tissues can be \r\nchanged, contributing to the development of tumors, or to the loss of \r\ncellular functions. Even learning can change the methylation of specific \r\ngenes. Duringin vitroculture, the enzymes of gene methylation \r\nare known to be increased, relative to their normal activity (Wang, \r\net al., 2005). The \r\nphenomenon of \"gene\" methylation in response to environmental \r\nand metabolic conditions may eventually lead to the extinction of the \r\ndoctrine that \"cells are controlled by their genes.\" During \r\nsuccessful adaptation to stress, cells make adjustments to their metabolic \r\nsystems (for example with a holistic change of the degree of phosphorylation, \r\nwhich increases molecules' affinity for water), and their metabolic \r\nprocesses can contribute to changes in their state of differentiation. \r\nSome changes may lead to successful adaptation (for example by producing \r\nbiogenic stimulators that stimulate cell functioning and regeneration), \r\nothers to failed adaptation. Even the decomposition of cells can release \r\nsubstances that contribute to the adaptation of surrounding cells, for \r\nexample when sphingosines stimulate the production of stem cells. DNA \r\nmethylation is just one relatively stable event that occurs in relation \r\nto a metabolic field.  Modifications of histones (regulatory proteins \r\nin chromosomes, which are acetylated as well as methylated) and structural-contractile \r\nfilaments also contribute to the differentiation of cells, but the pattern \r\nof DNA methylation seems to guide the methylation of histones and the \r\nstructure of the chromosomes (Nan, et al., 1998). Steroids \r\nand phospholipids, neurotransmitters and endorphins, ATP, GTP, other \r\nphosphates, retinoids, NO and CO2--many materials and processes participate \r\nin the coherence of the living state, the living substance. Carbon dioxide, \r\nfor example, by binding to lysine amino groups in the histones, will \r\ninfluence their methylation.  Carbon dioxide is likely to affect \r\nother amino groups in the chromosomes. The \r\nnumber and arrangement of mitochondria is an important factor in producing \r\nand maintaining the metabolic gradients. Things that decrease mitochondrial \r\nenergy production--nitric oxide, histamine, cytokines, cortisol--increase \r\nDNA methylation. Decreased gene expression is associated with reduced \r\nrespiratory energy. It seems reasonable to guess that increased gene \r\nexpression would demand increased availability of energy. As \r\nan ovum differentiates into an organism, cells become progressively \r\nmore specialized, inhibiting the expression of many genes. Less energy \r\nis needed by stably functioning cells, than by actively adapting cells. \r\nA.I. Zotin described the process of maturing and differentiating as \r\na decrease of entropy, an increase of order accompanying a decreased \r\nenergy expenditure. The entropic egg develops into a less entropic embryo \r\nwith a great expenditure of energy. The \r\npartially differentiated stem cell doesn't go through all the stages \r\nof development, but it does expend energy intensely as it matures. The \r\nrestoration of energy is one requirement for the activation of regeneration. \r\nWhen a hormone such as noradrenaline or insulin causes a stem cell to \r\ndifferentiate in vitro, it causes new mitochondria to form. This is \r\nsomewhat analogous to the insertion of mitochondria into the ripening \r\noocyte, by the nurse cells that surround it. The conditionally decreased \r\nentropy of maturation is reversed, and when sufficient respiratory energy \r\nis available, the renewed and refreshed cell will be able to renew an \r\nappropriate degree of differentiation. When \r\nsimple organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, or protozoa are stressed, \r\nfor example by the absence of nutrients or the presence of toxins, they \r\nslow their metabolism, and suppress the expression of genes, increasing \r\nthe methylation of DNA, to form resistant and quiescent spores. Our \r\ndifferentiated state doesn't go to the metabolic extreme seen in sporulation, \r\nbut it's useful to look at maturity and aging in this context, because \r\nit suggests that the wrong kind of stress decreases the ability of the \r\norganism to adapt, by processes resembling those in the spore-forming \r\norganisms. Charles \r\nVacanti, who has grown cartilage from cells taken from 100 year old \r\nhuman cartilage, believes our tissues contain \"spore cells,\" \r\nvery small cells with slow metabolism and extreme resistance to heat, \r\ncold, and starvation. If \r\nthe slowed metabolism of aging, like that of sporulating cells, is produced \r\nby a certain kind of stress that lowers cellular energy and functions, \r\nit might be useful to think of the other stages of the stress reaction \r\nin relation to the production of stem cells. Selye divided stress into \r\na first stage of shock, followed by a prolonged adaptation, which could \r\nsometimes end in exhaustion. If the maturity of differentiated functioning \r\nis equivalent to the adaptation phase, and cellular decline and disintegration \r\nis the exhaustion phase, then the shock-like reaction would correspond \r\nto the birth of new stem cells. Selye \r\ndescribed estrogen's effects as equivalent to the shock-phase of stress. \r\nEstrogen's basic action is to make oxygen unavailable, lowering the \r\noxygen tension of the tissues, locally and temporarily. Like nitric \r\noxide, which is produced by estrogenic stimulation, estrogen interferes \r\nwith energy production, so if its stimulation is prolonged, cells are \r\ndamaged or killed, rather than being stimulated to regenerate. Extrinsic \r\nfactors elicit renewal, the way stress can elicit adaptation. While \r\naging cells can't use the oxygen that is present, a scarcity of oxygen \r\ncan serve as a stimulus to maximize the respiratory systems. Brief oxygen \r\ndeprivation excites a cell, causes it to swell, and to begin to divide. Oxygen \r\ndeprivation, as in the normally hypoxic bone marrow, stimulates the \r\nformation of stem cells, as well as the biogenesis of mitochondria. \r\nAs the newly formed cells, with abundant mitochondria, get adequate \r\noxygen, they begin differentiation. Form, \r\nbased on cellular differentiation, follows function--a vein transplanted \r\ninto an artery develops anatomically into an artery, a colon attached \r\ndirectly to the anus becomes a new rectum with its appropriate innervation, \r\na broken bone restructures to form a normal bone. If the bladder is \r\nforced to function more than normal, by artificially keeping it filled, \r\nits thin wall of smooth muscle develops into a thick wall of striated \r\nmuscle that rhythmically contracts, like the heart. If a tadpole is \r\ngiven a vegetarian diet, the absorptive surface of its digestive system \r\nwill develop to be twice the size of those that are fed meat. Pressure, \r\nstretching, and pulsation are among the signals that guide cells' differentiation. Very \r\nearly in the study of embryology it was noticed that the presence of \r\none tissue sometimes induced the differentiation of another kind, and \r\nalso that there were factors in embryonic tissues that would stimulate \r\ncell division generally, and others that could inhibit the growth of \r\na particular tissue type. Diffusable substances and light were among \r\nthe factors identified as growth regulators. Extracts \r\nof particular tissues were found to suppress the multiplication of cells \r\nin that type of tissue, in adult animals as well as in embryos. In the \r\n1960s, the tissue-specific inhibitors were called chalones. The \r\nbrain's development is governed by the presence in the organism of the \r\nbody part to which it corresponds, such as the eyes or legs. The number \r\nof cells in a particular part of the nervous system is governed by the \r\nquantity of nervous input, sensory or motor, that it receives. An enriched \r\nenvironment causes a bigger brain to grow. Sensory nerve stimulation \r\nof a particular region of the brain causes nerve cells to migrate to \r\nthat area (a process called neurobiotaxis; deBeers, 1927), but nerve \r\nstimulation also causes mitochondria to accumulate in stimulated areas. \r\nNerve activity has a trophic, sustaining influence on other organs, \r\nas well as on the brain. Nerve stimulation, like mechanical pressure \r\nor stretching, is an important signal for cellular differentiation. When \r\nstem cells or progenitor cells are called on to replace cells in an \r\norgan, they are said to be \"recruited\" by that organ, or to \r\n\"home\" to that organ, if they are coming from elsewhere. Traditionally, \r\nthe bone marrow has been considered to be the source of circulating \r\nstem cells, but it now appears that a variety of other less differentiated \r\ncells can be recruited when needed. Cells from the blood can repair \r\nthe endothelium of blood vessels, and endothelial cells can become mesenchymal \r\ncells, in the heart, for example. The \r\nstandard doctrine about cancer is that a tumor derives from a single \r\nmutant cell, but it has been known for a long time that different types \r\nof cell, such as phagocytes and mast cells, usually reside in tumors, \r\nand it is now becoming clear that tumors recruit cells, including apparently \r\nnormal cells, from other parts of the same organ. For example, a brain \r\ntumor of glial cells, a glioma, recruits glial cells from surrounding \r\nareas of the brain, in a process that's analogous to the embryological \r\nmovement of nerve cells to a center of excitation. Each tumor, in a \r\nsense, seems to be a center of excitation, and its fate seems to depend \r\non the nature of the cells that respond to its signals. To \r\naccommodate some of the newer facts about tumors, the cancer establishment \r\nhas begun speaking of \"the cancer stem cell\" as the real villain, \r\nthe origin of the tumor, while the bulk of the tumor is seen to be made \r\nup of defective cells that have a short life-span. But if we recognize \r\nthat tumors are recruiting cells from beyond their boundaries, this \r\nprocess would account for the growth and survival of a tumor even while \r\nmost of its cells are inert and dying, without invoking the invisible \r\ncancer stem cell. And this view, that it is the field which is defective \r\nrather than the cell, is consistent with the evidence which has been \r\naccumulating for 35 years that tumor cells, given the right environment, \r\ncan differentiate into healthy cells. (Hendrix, et al., 2007) Simply \r\nstretching an organ (Woo, et al., 2007) is stimulus enough to cause \r\nit to recruit cells from the bloodstream, and will probably stimulate \r\nmultiplication in its local resident cells, too. Every \"cancer \r\nfield\" probably begins as a healing process, and generally the \r\nhealing and regeneration are at least partially successful. When \r\nan organ--the brain, heart, liver, or a blood vessel--is inflamed or \r\nsuffering from an insufficient blood supply, stem cells introduced into \r\nthe blood will migrate specifically to that organ. Organ \r\nspecific materials (chalones) are known to circulate in the blood, inhibiting \r\ncell division in cells typical to that organ, but it also seems that \r\norgan specific materials are secreted by a damaged organ, that help \r\nto prepare stem cells for their migration into that organ. When undifferentiated \r\ncells are cultured with serum from a person with liver failure, they \r\nbegin to differentiate into liver cells. It \r\nis still common to speak of each organ as having a \"clonal origin\" \r\nin the differentiating embryo, as a simple expansion of a certain embryonic \r\nanlage. The implication of this way of thinking is that differentiation \r\nisdeterminationin an irreversible sense. This is another case \r\nof medical ideas being based on images of fixed histological material. \r\nNormal cells, including nerve and muscle cells, can change type, with \r\nconnective tissue cells becoming nerve cells, nerve cells becoming muscle \r\nand fiber cells, fat, fiber, and muscle cells redifferentiating, for \r\nexample. Cell \r\nmovements in solid tissues aren't limited to the short distances between \r\ncapillaries and the tissues nourished by those capillaries, rather, \r\ncells can migrate much greater distances, without entering the bloodstream. \r\nThe speed of a single cell moving by ameboid motion can be measured \r\nby watching cells on a glass slide as they move toward food, or by watching \r\ncells of the slime mold Dictyostelium when they are aggregating, or \r\nby watching the pigment cells in and around moles or melanomas, under \r\nthe influence of hormones. At body temperature, a single cell can crawl \r\nabout an inch per day. Waves or spots of brown pigment can be seen migrating \r\nthrough the skin away from a mole, preceding the disintegration of the \r\nmole under the influence of progesterone or DHEA. Under ordinary conditions, \r\npigment cells can sometimes be seen migrating into depigmented areas \r\nof skin, during the recovery of an area affected by vitiligo. These \r\norganized movements of masses of cells happen to be easy to see, but \r\nthere is evidence that other types of cell can reconstruct tissues by \r\ntheir ameboid movements, when circumstances are right. Tumors or tissue \r\nabnormalities can appear or disappear with a suddenness that seems impossible \r\nto people who have studied only fixed tissue preparations. Stimulation \r\nis anabolic, building tissue, when the organism is adapting to the stimulation. \r\nUnused structures in cells and tissues are always being recycled by \r\nmetabolic processes. When tissues are injured and become unable to function, \r\nsome of their substances stimulate the growth of replacement cells. Some \r\ntypes of injury or irritation can activate regenerative processes. A \r\ndermatology journal described the case of an old man who had been bald \r\nfor many years who fell head-first into his fireplace. As his burned \r\nscalp healed, new hair grew. In the U.S., experimenters (Ito, et al., \r\n2007) have found that injuring the skin of mice stimulates the formation \r\nof stem cells that are able to become hair follicle cells, supporting \r\nthe regeneration of cells that had been absent. A brief exposure to \r\nestrogen, and other stress related signals (nitric oxide, endorphin, \r\nprostaglandins) can initiate stem cell proliferation. In \r\nthe years after the first world war, Vladimir Filatov, who developed \r\ntechniques of reconstructive surgery, including corneal transplants, \r\nfound that cold storage of tissues (for example, corneas from cadavers) \r\ncaused them to function better than fresh tissues, and he found that \r\nthese stressed tissues would often spread a healing influence out into \r\nthe surrounding tissues. Extracts of stressed tissues produced similar \r\neffects. L.V. \r\nPolezhaev began studying the regenerative capacities of mammals in the \r\nlate 1940s, and his work showed that processes similar to embryonic \r\ninduction are involved in the organism's responses to damaged tissues. \r\nFor example, when a piece of killed muscle tissue is enclosed in a capsule \r\n(\"diffusion chamber\") that permits molecules, but no cells, \r\nto diffuse through it, and implanted subcutaneously, it had no inductive \r\neffect on surrounding cells. But when the pores of the capsule allowed \r\ncells to enter, skeletal muscle formed where the dead tissue had been, \r\nand tissue resembling heart muscle formed outside the capsule. Phagocytosis \r\nhad been essential for the induction to occur. Macrophages \r\nare ordinarily thought of as \"antigen-presenting cells\" that \r\nhelp to activate the specific immune responses. But apparently phagocytosis \r\nis involved in the replacement of damaged tissues, by recruiting or \r\ninducing the differentiation of replacement cells. The phagocytosis \r\nfunction isn't limited to the blood cells commonly called phagocytes; \r\neven nerve cells can ingest particles and fragments of damaged tissues. Many \r\nfactors regulate the process of phagocytosis. Stress and lipid peroxidation \r\ndecrease phagocytosis (Izgüt-Uysal, et al., 2004), and also damage \r\nmitochondria and inhibit cell renewal. Unsaturated \r\nfatty acids inhibit phagocytosis (Guimaraes, et al., 1991, 1992; Costa \r\nRosa, et al., 1996; Virella, et al., 1989; Akamatsu, et al., 1990), \r\nand suppress mitochondrial function (Gomes, et al., 2006).  Dietary \r\nrestriction activates phagocytosis (Moriguchi, et al., 1989), suggesting \r\nthat normal diets contain suppressive materials. Subnormal \r\ntemperatures cause a shift from phagocytosis to inflammation. Light, \r\nespecially the red light which penetrates easily into tissues, activates \r\nthe formation of new cells as well as their differentiation. It affects \r\nenergy production, increasing the formation of mitochondria, and the \r\nactivity of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes. Red light accelerates \r\nwound healing, and improves the quality of the scar, reducing the amount \r\nof fibrosis. The daily cycling between darkness and light is probably \r\nan important factor in regulating the birth and differentiation of cells.. Darkness \r\nsuppresses mitochondrial function, and light activates it. Prolonged \r\ndarkness increases cortisol, and cortisol (which makes cells more susceptible \r\nto excitotoxic death) inhibits stem cell proliferation (Li, et al., \r\n2006; Liu, et al., 2003). Neurogenesis is suppressed by stress, and \r\nincreased by spontaneous activity, and has a circadian rhythm. Aging \r\nand depression both involve a diminished ability to rhythmically lower \r\nthe production of cortisol. Cell renewal requires a rhythmic decrease \r\nin the exposure to cortisol.. In \r\nthe spring, with increased day length, the brains of song-birds grow, \r\nwith an increased proliferation of cells in the part of the brain involved \r\nin singing. The production of progesterone increases in most animals \r\nin the spring, and it is the main hormone responsible for the birds' \r\nbrain growth. Progesterone \r\nand its metabolites protect brain cells against injury, and improve \r\nthe brain's ability to recover after traumatic injury (Brinton and Wang, \r\n2006). In the 1960s, Marion Diamond's group showed that environmental \r\nenrichment, or progesterone, caused brains to grow larger, and that \r\nthese changes were passed on to descendants in a cumulative, increasing \r\nway. This suggests that the factors that promote neurogenesis also cause \r\nchanges in the apparatus of reproduction and inheritance, that support \r\nthe development of the brain--probably including the methylation system, \r\nwhich is involved in regulating genes, and also mood and behavior. Women's \r\nmonthly cycles, in which a brief estrogen dominance is followed by sustained \r\nexposure to progesterone, are probably an important factor in the renewal \r\nof the cells of the brain and other organs, as well as those of the \r\nreproductive organs. The daily rhythms of hormones and metabolism are \r\nknown to be involved in the regulation of cell renewal. Environmental \r\nenrichment, learning, high altitude, and thyroid hormone promote the \r\nformation of new mitochondria, and stimulate stem cell proliferation. \r\nAt least in some laboratories, 20% oxygen, approximately the amount \r\nas in the atmosphere, suppresses the proliferation of stem cells (He, \r\net al., 2007). This was the unphysiologically high concentration of \r\noxygen used in Hayflick's cell cultures. At high altitudes, where tissues \r\nare exposed to less oxygen, and more carbon dioxide, there is a lower \r\nincidence of all the degenerative diseases, including cancer, heart \r\ndisease, and dementia. Improved cellular energy production and more \r\nactive renewal of cells would probably account for those differences. For \r\nCrick, the idea of a diffusion gradient to explain embryonic development \r\nwas simply an extension of his reductionist orientation, in which diffusing \r\nmolecules induced or inhibited bacterial genes, and in which genes controlled \r\ncells. For people with that orientation, the adaptive mutations described \r\nby Carl Lindegren, and later by John Cairns, or even the stress-induced \r\nvariability described by Lysenko, Strong, and McClintock, were heretical. \r\nPolezhaev's demonstration that cells could do something that molecular \r\ndiffusion didn't do, threatened to take biology away from the reductionists. \r\nIf the organism's adaptation to the environment involves changing its \r\nown genes, Crick's paradigm fails. Crick's \r\nCentral Dogma, derived from the ideology that produced Weismann's Barrier, \r\nhas been invoked by generations of professors who wanted to deny the \r\npossibility of adaptive tissue renewal and regeneration. Without the \r\ndogma, new ideas about aging and disease will be needed. If somatic \r\ncells can adjust their genes, and if they can also differentiate into \r\nnew eggs and sperms, new ideas about inheritance of acquired traits \r\nwill be needed. The \r\nreplacement of injured cells means that mutations need not accumulate. \r\nCell renewal with elimination of mutant cells has been observed in sun-damaged \r\nskin simply by stopping the damage, and mitochondria with damaged DNA \r\ncan be replaced by healthy mitochondria simply by doing the right kind \r\nof exercise. The \r\nregulation of cell renewal probably involves all of the processes of \r\nlife, but there are a few simple, interacting factors that suppress \r\nrenewal. The accumulation of polyunsaturated fats, interacting with \r\na high concentration of oxygen, damages mitochondria, and causes a chronic \r\nexcessive exposure to cortisol. With mitochondrial damage, cells are \r\nunable to produce the progesterone needed to oppose cortisol and to \r\nprotect cells. Choosing \r\nthe right foods, the right atmosphere, the right mental and physical \r\nactivities, and finding the optimal rhythms of light, darkness, and \r\nactivity, can begin to alter the streaming renewal of cells in all the \r\norgans. Designing a more perfect environment is going to be much simpler \r\nthan the schemes of the genetic engineers. © Ray Peat Ph.D. 2007. All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com",

Prenatal stress commonly predisposes a person to develop \r\nschizophrenia at a later age.Serotonins restriction of circulation to the \r\nuterus is a major factor in toxemia of pregnancy and related complications \r\nof pregnancy.Hypothyroidism increases serotonin activity in \r\nthe body, as it increases estrogen dominance.Estrogen inhibits the enzyme monoamino oxidase \r\n(MAO), and is highly associated with increased serotonin activity.  \r\nProgesterone has the opposite effect on MAO.The frontal lobes of the brain are hypometabolic \r\nin schizophrenia.  Serotonin can cause vasoconstriction in the \r\nbrain.Serotonin release causes lipid peroxidation.Schizophrenics have high levels of lipid peroxidation.Antioxidants, including uric acid, are deficient \r\nin schizophrenics.Therapies which improve mitochondrial respiration \r\nalleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia.Energy depletion leads to brain atrophy, but with \r\nnormal stimulation and nutrition even adult brains can grow.Schizophrenics and depressed people have defective \r\nsleep.Increasing the bodys energy level and temperature \r\nimproves the quality of sleep.================Everyone \r\nis familiar with the problem of defining insanity, in the case of people \r\nwho plead innocent by reason of insanity.  The official definition \r\nof insanity in criminal law is the inability to tell right from wrong.  \r\nObviously, that cant be generalized to everyday life, because any \r\nsane person realizes that certainty is impossible, and that most situations, \r\nincluding elections, offer you at best the choice of the lesser of \r\ntwo evils, or the opportunity to do the right thing, and to \r\nthrow your vote away.  People who persist in doing what they \r\nknow is really right are eccentric, in the sense that they dont \r\nadapt to societys norms. In a society that chooses to destroy ecosystems, \r\nrather than adapting to them, the question of sanity should be an everyday \r\npolitical issue.The use \r\nof medical terms tends to give authority to the people who are in charge \r\nof defining the terms, and it can give the impression of objectivity \r\nwhen there really isnt any scientific validity behind the terms.  \r\nIn their historical senses, crazy (flawed) and insane (unsound) \r\nare probably more objective terms than the medically-invented terms, \r\ndementia praecox (premature idiocy) or schizophrenia (divided mind).Odd \r\nSpeech is one of the dimensions used in the diagnosis of insanity.  \r\nI am reminded of William Wordsworths dismissal of William Blake as \r\ninsane after failing to understand some of Blakes poems--Wordsworth \r\nwas conventional enough to become Englands Poet Laureate, and to \r\nhis limited perspective, Blakes clear verses were incomprehensibly \r\nodd.Whenever \r\na trusted government employee decides to blow the whistle on criminal \r\nactivities, his agency invariably puts out the information that this \r\nnow discharged employee is psychologically unbalanced.  Dissent, \r\nin other words, is easy to dispose of by psychiatric tainting.If we \r\nare going to speak of mental impairment, then we should have objective \r\nmeasures of what we are talking about.  Blake unquestionably could \r\ndo anything better than Wordsworth, because he was neither stupid nor \r\ndishonest, and its almost a rule that ordinary employees are more \r\ncompetent than the administrators who evaluate their work.  Objective \r\nstandards of mental impairment would be more popular among patients \r\nthan among diagnosticians, judges, and lawmakers.In a famous \r\ntest of the objectivity of diagnosis, a filmed interview with a patient \r\nwas shown to British and U.S. psychiatrists.  69% of the Americans \r\ndiagnosed the patient as schizophrenic, but only 2% of the British psychiatrists \r\ndid.The strictly \r\nmedical/psychological definition of insanity is still, despite the existence \r\nof the International Classification of Diseases, and in the U.S. the \r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual, which enumerate a large number of \r\nmental disorders, a crazily indefinite grouping of symptoms, and \r\nhasnt made diagnosis more objective..  For example, in the last \r\n30 years autism has been separated from childhood schizophrenia, but \r\nnow the tendency is for both of them to be called developmental brain \r\ndisorders. Both schizophrenia and autism are now often described in \r\nterms of a spectrum of conditions, which hardly matters, since \r\nthey are not understood in terms of cause, prevention, or cure.The problem is in the history of psychosis as a medical idea.  \r\nAbout 100 years ago, attempts were made to classify psychoses by their \r\nsymptoms, unifying a great variety of old diagnostic categories into \r\ntwo groups, manic-depressive mood disorders, and dementia praecox, \r\nor schizophrenia, which (as indicated by its name, premature dementia) \r\nwas considered to be progressive and incurable.  Several kinds \r\nof mental disorder were found to have clear causes, including vitamin \r\ndeficiencies and various poisons and infections, but the idea of a certain \r\nthing called schizophrenia still persists.The unitary \r\nconcept of psychosis grew up in a culture in which endogenous insanity \r\nwas a hereditary taint, that for a time was treated by imprisonment, \r\nand that more recently has been treated with sterilization or euthanasia \r\nto eliminate the insanity genes.The idea \r\nthat the disease is in the genes now serves the drug industry \r\nwell, since they offer chemicals that will correct the specific chemical \r\nerror.Not all \r\npsychiatrists and psychologists subscribed to the idea of a unitary \r\npsychosis, defined by a variety of symptoms.  A positive contribution \r\nof Freudian psychoanalysis (and its congeners and competitors) was that \r\nit made people think in terms of causes and the possibility of cures, \r\ninstead of hopelessness, stigmatization, isolation and eradication. \r\nAlthough Freud expressed the thought that biological causes and cures \r\nwould eventually be found, the profession he founded was not sympathetic \r\nto the idea of physiological therapies.Looking \r\nfor general physiological problems behind the various symptoms is very \r\ndifferent from the practice of classifying the insanities according \r\nto their symptoms and the hypothetical brain chemicals that are \r\nbelieved to cause the symptoms. The fact that some patients hallucinate \r\ncaused many psychiatrists to believe that hallucinogenic chemicals, \r\ninterfering with nerve transmitter substances such as dopamine or serotonin, \r\nwere going to provide insight into psychotic states. The dopamine excess \r\n(or serotonin deficiency) theories developed at a time when only a few \r\ntransmitter substances were known, and when they were thought \r\nto act as very specific on/off nerve switches, rather than as links \r\nin metabolic networks. The drug industry helps to keep those ideas alive.The idea \r\nthat the brain is like a computer, and that the nerves are like wires \r\nand switches, is behind all of the theories about transmitter substances \r\nand synapses. If this metaphor about the nature of the brain and the \r\norganism is fundamentally wrong, then the theories of schizophrenia \r\nbased on nerve transmitter substances can hardly be right.  Another \r\ntheory of schizophrenia based on the computer metaphor has to do with \r\nthe idea that nerve cells wire-like and switch-like functions depend \r\non their membranes, and, in the most popular version, that these all-important \r\nmembranes are made of fish oil.  The supporting evidence is supposed \r\nto be that the fish-oil-like fatty acids are depleted from the tissues \r\nof schizophrenics. Just looking at that point, the evidence is \r\nmore likely to be the result of stress, which depletes unsaturated fatty \r\nacids, especially of the specified type, in producing lipid peroxides \r\nand other toxic molecules.In one \r\nof its variations, the essential fatty acid deficiency doctrine \r\nsuggests that a certain prostaglandin deficiency is the cause of schizophrenia, \r\nbut experiments have shown that anexcessof that prostaglandin mimics the symptoms of psychosis.The drug industrys effect on the way the organism is commonly understood \r\nhas been pervasively pathological.  For example, the dogma about \r\ncell surface receptors has sometimes explicitly led people to \r\nsay that the brain chemicals are activeonlyat the surface of cells, and not inside the cells.The consequences of this mistake have been catastrophic.  For \r\nexample, serotonins precursor, tryptophan, and the drugs called serotonin \r\nreuptake inhibitors, and other serotonergic drugs, and serotonin \r\nitself, are carcinogenic and/or tumor promoters. Excessive serotonin \r\nis a major factor in kidney and heart failure, liver and lung disease, \r\nstroke, pituitary abnormalities, inflammatory diseases, practically \r\nevery kind of sickness, at the beginning, middle, and end of life. In \r\nthe brain, serotonin regulates circulation and mitochondrial function, \r\ntemperature, respiration and appetite, alertness and learning, secretion \r\nof prolactin, growth hormones and stress hormones, and participates \r\nin the most complex biochemical webs.  But the pharmaceutical industrys \r\nmyth has led people to believe that serotonin is the chemical of happiness, \r\nand that tryptophan is its benign nutritional precursor, and that they \r\nare going to harmlessly influence the receptors on nerve membranes.A particular drug has many effects other than those that are commonly \r\nrecognized as its mechanism of action, but when an antidepressant \r\nor a tranquilizer or a serotonin reuptake inhibitor alleviates \r\na particular condition, some people argue that the condition must have \r\nbeen caused by the specific chemistry that the drug is thought \r\nto affect.  Because of the computer metaphor for the brain, these \r\neffects are commonly thought to be primarily in the synapses, the membranes, \r\nand the transmitter chemicals.The argument for a genetic cause of schizophrenia relies heavily \r\non twin studies in which the frequency of both twins being schizophrenic \r\nis contrasted to the normal incidence of schizophrenia in the population, \r\nwhich is usually about 1%.  There is a concordance of 30% to 40% \r\nbetween monozygotic (identical) twins, and a 5% to 10% concordance between \r\nfraternal twins, and both of these rates are higher than that of other \r\nsiblings in the same family. That argument neglects the closer similarity \r\nof the intrauterine conditions experienced by twins, for example the \r\nsharing of the same placenta, and experiencing more concordant biochemical \r\ninteractions between fetus and mother.Defects of the brain, head, face, and even hands and fingerprints \r\nare seen more frequently in the genetically identical twin who later \r\ndevelops schizophrenia than  the twin who doesnt develop schizophrenia.  \r\nOf the twins, it is the baby with the lower birth weight and head size \r\nthat is at a greater risk of developing schizophrenia.Oliver Gillie (in his book,Who Do You Think You Are?)discussed some of the fraud that has occurred in twin studies, but \r\nno additional fraud is needed when the non-genetic explanation is simply \r\nignored and excluded from discussion.  The editors of most medical \r\nand scientific journals are so convinced of the reality of genetic determination \r\nthat they wont allow their readers to see criticisms of it.Prenatal malnutriton or hormonal stress or other stresses are known \r\nto damage the brain, and especially its most highly evolved and metabolically \r\nactive frontal lobes, and to reduce its growth, relative to the rest \r\nof the body.The standard medical explanation for the association of pregnancy \r\ntoxemia and eclampsia with birth defects has been, until recently, that \r\nboth mother and child were genetically inferior, and that the defective \r\nchild created the pregnancy sickness.  The same reasoning \r\nhas been invoked to explain the association of birth complications with \r\nlater disease:The defective \r\nbaby was thecauseof a difficult birth.  That argument has \r\nrecently been discredited (McNeil and Cantor-Graae, 1999).Schizophrenics are known to have had a higher \r\nrate of obstetrical complications, including oxygen deprivation and \r\nCesarian deliveries, than normal people.  Like people with Alzheimers \r\ndisease, the circumference of their heads at birth was small, in proportion \r\nto their body weight and gestational age.Animal studies show that perinatal brain problems \r\ntend to persist, influencing the brains metabolism and function in \r\nadulthood.Like the other major brain diseases, shizophrenia \r\ninvolves a low metabolic rate in crucial parts of the brain. In schizophrenics, \r\nhypofrontality, low metabolism of the frontal lobes, is characteristic, \r\nalong with abnormal balance between the hemispheres, and other regional \r\nimbalances.A very important form of prenatal stress occurs \r\nin toxemia and preeclampsia, in which estrogen is dominant, and endotoxin \r\nand serotonin create a stress reaction with hypertension and impaired \r\nblood circulation to the uterus and placenta.The brain, just like any organ or tissue, is an \r\nenergy-producing metabolic system, and its oxidative metabolism is extremely \r\nintense, and it is more dependent on oxygen for continuous normal functioning \r\nthan any other organ.  Without oxygen, its characteristic functioning \r\n(consciousness) stops instantly (when blood flow stops, blindness begins \r\nin about three seconds, and other responses stop after a few more seconds).  \r\nThe concentration of ATP, which is called the cellular energy molecule, \r\ndoesnt decrease immediately. Nothing detectable happens to the neurotransmitters, \r\nsynapses, or membrane structures in this short period;consciousness is a metabolic process that, in the computer metaphor, \r\nwould be the flow of electrons itself, under the influence of an electromotive \r\nforce, a complex but continuous sort of electromagnetic field.  \r\nThe computer metaphor would seem to have little to offer for understanding \r\nthe brain.In this context, I think its necessary, for \r\nthe present, to ignore the diagnostic details, the endless variety of \r\nqualifications of the idea of schizophrenia, that fill the literature. \r\nThose diagnostic concepts seem to tempt people to look for the precise \r\ncause of this particular subcategory of schizophrenia, and to believe \r\nthat a specific drug or combination of drugs will be found to treat \r\nit, while encouraging them to ignore the patients physiology and \r\nhistory.If we use the standard medical terms at all, it \r\nshould be with the recognition that they are, in their present and historical \r\nform, not scientifically meaningful.The idea that schizophrenia is a disease in itself \r\ntends to distract attention from the things it has in common with Alzheimers \r\ndisease, autism, depression, mania, the manic-depressive syndrome, the \r\nhyperactivity-attention deficit syndrome, and many other physical and \r\nmental problems.  When brain abnormalities are found in schizophrenics \r\nbut not in their normal siblings, it could be tempting to see the abnormalities \r\nas the cause of schizophrenia, unless we see similar abnormalities \r\nin a variety of sicknesses.For the present, its best to think first in \r\nthe most general terms possible, such as a brain stress syndrome, \r\nwhich will include brain aging, stroke, altitude sickness, seizures, \r\nmalnutrition, poisoning, the despair brought on by inescapable stress, \r\nand insomnia, which are relatively free of culturally arbitrary definitions.  \r\nDifficulty in learning, remembering, and analyzing are objective enough \r\nthat it could be useful to see what they have to do with a brain \r\nstress syndrome.Stress damages the energy producing systems of \r\ncells, especially the aerobic mitochondria, in many ways, and this damage \r\ncan often be repaired. The insanities that are most often called schizophrenia \r\ntend to occur in late adolescence, or around menopause, or in old age, \r\nwhich are times of stress, especially hormonal stress.  Post-partum \r\npsychosis often has features that resemble schizophrenia.Although the prenatal factors that predispose \r\na person toward the brain stress syndrome, and those that trigger specific \r\nsymptoms later in life, might seem to be utterly different, the hormonal \r\nand biochemical reactions are probably closely related, involving the \r\nadaptive responses of various functional systems to the problem of insufficient \r\nadaptive ability and inadequate energy.By considering cellular energy production, local \r\nblood flow, and the systemic support system, we can get insight into \r\nsome of the biochemical events that are involved in therapies that are \r\nsometimes successful. A unified concept of health and disease will help \r\nto understand both the origins and the appropriate treatments for a \r\ngreat variety of brain stress syndromes.The simple availability of oxygen, and the ability \r\nto use it, are regulated by carbon dioxide and serotonin, which act \r\nin opposite directions. Carbon dioxide inhibits the release of serotonin.  \r\nCarbon dioxide and serotonin are regulated most importantly by thyroid \r\nfunction. Hypothyroidism is characterized by increased levels of both \r\nnoradrenalin and serotonin, and of other stress-related hormones, including \r\ncortisol and estrogen.  Estrogen shifts the balance of the neurotransmitters \r\nin the same direction, toward increased serotonin and adrenalin, for \r\nexample by inhibiting enzymes that degrade the monoamine neurotransmitters.When an animal such as a squirrel approaches hibernation \r\nand is producing less carbon dioxide, the decrease in carbon dioxide \r\nreleases serotonin, which slows respiration, lowers temperature, suppresses \r\nappetite, and produces torpor.But in energy-deprived humans, increases of adrenalin \r\noppose the hibernation reaction, alter energy production and the ability \r\nto relax, and to sleep deeply and with restorative effect.In several ways, torpor is the opposite of sleep.  \r\nRapid eye movement (REM), that occurs at intervals during sleep and \r\nin association with increased respiration, disappears when the brain \r\nof a hibernating animal falls below a certain temperature.  But \r\ntorpor isnt like non-REM deep sleep, and in fact seems to belike wakefulness,in the sense that a sleep-debt is incurred:Hibernating animals periodically come out of torpor so they can sleep, \r\nand in those periods, when their temperature rises sharply, they have \r\na very high percentage of deep slow wave sleep.Although it is common to speak of sleep and hibernation \r\nas variations on the theme of economizing on energy expenditure, I suspect \r\nthat nocturnal sleep has the special function of minimizing the stress \r\nof darkness itself, and that it has subsidiary functions, including \r\nits now well confirmed role in the consolidation and organization of \r\nmemory. This view of sleep is consistent with observations that disturbed \r\nsleep is associated with obesity, and that the torpor-hibernation chemical, \r\nserotonin, powerfully interferes with learning.Babies spend most of their time sleeping, and \r\nduring life the amount of time spent sleeping decreases, with nightly \r\nsleeping time decreasing by about half an hour per decade after middle \r\nage. Babies have an extremely high metabolic rate and a stable temperature.  \r\nWith age the metabolic rate progressively declines, and as a result \r\nthe ability to maintain an adequate body temperature tends to decrease \r\nwith aging.(The simple fact that body temperature regulates \r\nall organic functions, including brain waves, is habitually overlooked.  \r\nThe actions of a drug on brain waves, for example, may be mediated by \r\nits effects on body temperature, but this wouldnt be very interesting \r\nto pharmacologists looking for transmitter-specific drugs.)Torpor is the opposite of restful sleep, and with \r\naging, depression, hypothyroidism, and a variety of brain syndromes, \r\nsleep tends toward the hypothermic torpor.An individual cell behaves analogously to the \r\nwhole person. A babys high energy resting state is paralleled \r\nby the stable condition of a cell that is abundantly charged with energy;ATP and carbon dioxide are at high levels in these cells. Progesterones \r\neffects on nerve cells include favoring the high energy resting state, \r\nand this is closely involved in progesterones thermogenic effect, \r\nin which it raises the temperature set-point.The basal metabolic rate, which is mainly governed \r\nby thyroid, roughly corresponds to the average body temperature. However, \r\nin hypothyroidism, there is an adaptive increase in the activity of \r\nthe sympathetic nervous system, producing more adrenalin, which helps \r\nto maintain body temperature by causing vasoconstriction in the skin. \r\nIn aging, menopause, and various stressful conditions, the increased \r\nadrenalin (and the increased cortisol production which is produced by \r\nexcess adrenalin) causes a tendency to wake more easily, and to have \r\nless restful sleep.While the early morning body temperature will \r\nsometimes be low in hypothyroidism, I have found many exceptions to \r\nthis. In protein deficiency, sodium deficiency, in menopause with flushing \r\nsymptoms, and in both phases of the manic depression cycle, and in some \r\nschizophrenics, the morning temperature is high, corresponding to very \r\nhigh levels of adrenalin and cortisol.  Taking the temperature \r\nbefore and after breakfast will show a reduction of temperature, the \r\nopposite of what occurs in simple hypothyroidism, because raising the \r\nblood sugar permits the adrenalin and cortisol to fall.The characteristic sleep pattern of hypothyroidism \r\nand old age is similar to the pattern seen in schizophrenia and depression, \r\na decrease of deep slow wave sleep. Serotonin, like torpor, produces \r\na similar effect. In other words, a torpor-like state can be seen in \r\nall of these brain-stress states. Several studies have found that anti-serotonin \r\ndrugs improve sleep, and also reduce symptoms of schizophrenia and depression. \r\nIt is common for the neuroleptic drugs to raise body temperature, \r\neven pathologically as in the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.In old people, who lose heat easily during the \r\nday, their extreme increase in the compensatory nervous and hormonal \r\nadrenalin activity causes their night-time heat regulation (vasoconstriction \r\nin the extremities) to rise to normal.Increased body temperature improves sleep, especially \r\nthe deep slow wave sleep. A hot bath, or even warming the feet, has \r\nthe same effect as thyroid in improving sleep. Salty and sugary foods \r\ntaken at bedtime, or during the night, help to improve the quality and \r\nduration of sleep. Both salt and sugar lower the adrenalin level, and \r\nboth tend to raise the body temperature.Hypothyroidism tends to cause the blood and other \r\nbody fluids to be deficient in both sodium and glucose. Consuming salty \r\ncarbohydrate foods momentarily makes up to some extent for the thyroid \r\ndeficiency.In the peiodic table of the elements, lithium \r\nis immediately above sodium, meaning that it has the chemical properties \r\nof sodium, but with a smaller atomic radius, which makes its electrical \r\ncharge more intense. Its physiological effects are so close to sodiums \r\nthat we can get clues to sodiums actions by watching what lithium \r\ndoes.Chronic consumption of lithium blocks the release \r\nof adrenalin from the adrenal glands, and it also has extensive antiserotonin \r\neffects, inhibiting its release from some sites, and blocking its actions \r\nat others.Lithium forms a complex with the ammonia molecule, \r\nand since the ammonia molecule mimics the effects of serotonin, especially \r\nin fatigue, this could be involved in lithiums antiserotonergic effects. \r\nAmmonia, like serotonin, impairs mitochondrial energy production (at \r\na minimum, it uses energy in being converted to urea), so anti-ammonia, \r\nanti-serotonin agents make more energy available for adaptation.  \r\nLithium has been demonstrated to restore the energy metabolism of mitochondria \r\n(Gulidova, 1977).Therapies that have been successful in treating \r\nschizophrenia include penicillin, sleep therapy, hyperbaric oxygen, \r\ncarbon dioxide therapy, thyroid, acetazolamide, lithium and vitamins. \r\nThese all make fundamental contributions to the restoration of biological \r\nenergy.  Antibiotics, for example, lower endotoxin formation in \r\nthe intestine, protect against the induction by endotoxin of serotonin, \r\nhistamine, estrogen, and cortisol. Acetazolamide causes the tissues \r\nto retain carbon dioxide, and increased carbon dioxide acidifies cells, \r\npreventing serotonin secretion.REFERENCESGen Pharmacol 1994 Oct;25(6):1257-1262.Serotonin-induced decrease in brain ATP, stimulation of brain anaerobic \r\nglycolysis and elevation of plasma hemoglobin; the protective action \r\nof calmodulin antagonists.Koren-Schwartzer N, Chen-Zion M, Ben-Porat H, \r\nBeitner R Department of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, \r\nIsrael.1.

Acetazolamide showed the effectiveness \r\nin 10 cases out of 13 cases to which lithium carbonate and carbamazepine \r\nwere ineffective.The high therapeutic effects of acetazolamide were shown in the cases \r\nwhosesymptoms \r\nwere aggravated at the interval of the menstrual cycle.No correlation was observed between the electroencephalographic abnormalities \r\nand the therapeutic effects. In addition, the prophylactic effects of \r\nacetazolamide on the periodic crisis were observed in 9 cases. From \r\nthese results, acetazolamide was considered to have the antipsychotic \r\nand prophylactic effects on atypical psychosis.Since side effects due to acetazolamide were rarely observed, the \r\npresent drug was considered to have a high safety margin.Am J Psychiatry 1999 Apr;156(4):617-23Minor physical anomalies, dermatoglyphic asymmetries, and cortisol \r\nlevels in adolescents with schizotypal personality disorder.Weinstein DD, \r\nDiforio D, Schiffman J, Walker E, Bonsall R. The schizotypal personality \r\ndisorder group showed more minor physical anomalies and dermatoglyphic \r\nasymmetries than the normal comparison group and higher cortisol levels \r\nthan both of the other groups.Am J Psychiatry 1992 Jan;149(1):57-61Congenital malformations and structural developmental anomalies in \r\ngroups at high risk for psychosis.McNeil TF, Blennow G, Lundberg L. The inferred genetic risk forpsychosis does not appear to be associated with greater rates of early \r\nsomatic developmental anomalies, suggesting that early developmental \r\nanomalies do not represent an expression of genetic influence toward \r\npsychosis.Schizophr Bull 1984;10(2):204-32.Psychophysiological dysfunctions in the developmental course of schizophrenic \r\ndisorders.Dawson ME, Nuechterlein KH. Two electrodermal anomalies are identified \r\nin different subgroups of symptomaticpatients: \r\n(1) an abnormally high sympathetic arousal and (2) an abnormal absence \r\nof skin conductance orienting responses to innocuous environmental stimuli.Behav Brain Res 2000 Jan;107(1-2):71-83.Changes in adult brain and behavior caused by neonatal limbic damage: \r\nimplications for the etiology of schizophrenia.Hanlon FM, Sutherland RJ. .This study contributes to our understanding \r\nof the pathogenesis of schizophrenia by showing that early damage to \r\nlimbic structures produced behavioral, morphological, and neuropharmacological \r\nabnormalities related to pathology in adult schizophrenics.Neurochem Res 1996 Sep; 21(9):995-1004.Mitochondrial involvement in schizophrenia and other functional psychoses.Whatley SA, Curti \r\nD, Marchbanks RM. Gene expression has been studied in post-mortem \r\nfrontal cortex samples from patients who had suffered from schizophrenia \r\nand depressive illness. We conclude that changes in mitochondrial \r\ngene expression are involved in schizophrenia and probably other functional \r\npsychoses.Eur J Pharmacol 1994 Aug 11;261(1-2):25-32.The effect of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists \r\nin isolated globally ischemic rat hearts.Sargent CA, Dzwonczyk S, Grover GJ. The alpha \r\n2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, has been reported to protect hypoxic \r\nmyocardium.

The official definition \r\nof insanity in criminal law is the inability to tell right from wrong.  \r\nObviously, that cant be generalized to everyday life, because any \r\nsane person realizes that certainty is impossible, and that most situations, \r\nincluding elections, offer you at best the choice of the lesser of \r\ntwo evils, or the opportunity to do the right thing, and to \r\nthrow your vote away.  People who persist in doing what they \r\nknow is really right are eccentric, in the sense that they dont \r\nadapt to societys norms. In a society that chooses to destroy ecosystems, \r\nrather than adapting to them, the question of sanity should be an everyday \r\npolitical issue.The use \r\nof medical terms tends to give authority to the people who are in charge \r\nof defining the terms, and it can give the impression of objectivity \r\nwhen there really isnt any scientific validity behind the terms.  \r\nIn their historical senses, crazy (flawed) and insane (unsound) \r\nare probably more objective terms than the medically-invented terms, \r\ndementia praecox (premature idiocy) or schizophrenia (divided mind).Odd \r\nSpeech is one of the dimensions used in the diagnosis of insanity.  \r\nI am reminded of William Wordsworths dismissal of William Blake as \r\ninsane after failing to understand some of Blakes poems--Wordsworth \r\nwas conventional enough to become Englands Poet Laureate, and to \r\nhis limited perspective, Blakes clear verses were incomprehensibly \r\nodd.Whenever \r\na trusted government employee decides to blow the whistle on criminal \r\nactivities, his agency invariably puts out the information that this \r\nnow discharged employee is psychologically unbalanced.  Dissent, \r\nin other words, is easy to dispose of by psychiatric tainting.If we \r\nare going to speak of mental impairment, then we should have objective \r\nmeasures of what we are talking about.  Blake unquestionably could \r\ndo anything better than Wordsworth, because he was neither stupid nor \r\ndishonest, and its almost a rule that ordinary employees are more \r\ncompetent than the administrators who evaluate their work.  Objective \r\nstandards of mental impairment would be more popular among patients \r\nthan among diagnosticians, judges, and lawmakers.In a famous \r\ntest of the objectivity of diagnosis, a filmed interview with a patient \r\nwas shown to British and U.S. psychiatrists.  69% of the Americans \r\ndiagnosed the patient as schizophrenic, but only 2% of the British psychiatrists \r\ndid.The strictly \r\nmedical/psychological definition of insanity is still, despite the existence \r\nof the International Classification of Diseases, and in the U.S. the \r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual, which enumerate a large number of \r\nmental disorders, a crazily indefinite grouping of symptoms, and \r\nhasnt made diagnosis more objective..  For example, in the last \r\n30 years autism has been separated from childhood schizophrenia, but \r\nnow the tendency is for both of them to be called developmental brain \r\ndisorders. Both schizophrenia and autism are now often described in \r\nterms of a spectrum of conditions, which hardly matters, since \r\nthey are not understood in terms of cause, prevention, or cure.The problem is in the history of psychosis as a medical idea.  \r\nAbout 100 years ago, attempts were made to classify psychoses by their \r\nsymptoms, unifying a great variety of old diagnostic categories into \r\ntwo groups, manic-depressive mood disorders, and dementia praecox, \r\nor schizophrenia, which (as indicated by its name, premature dementia) \r\nwas considered to be progressive and incurable.  Several kinds \r\nof mental disorder were found to have clear causes, including vitamin \r\ndeficiencies and various poisons and infections, but the idea of a certain \r\nthing called schizophrenia still persists.The unitary \r\nconcept of psychosis grew up in a culture in which endogenous insanity \r\nwas a hereditary taint, that for a time was treated by imprisonment, \r\nand that more recently has been treated with sterilization or euthanasia \r\nto eliminate the insanity genes.The idea \r\nthat the disease is in the genes now serves the drug industry \r\nwell, since they offer chemicals that will correct the specific chemical \r\nerror.Not all \r\npsychiatrists and psychologists subscribed to the idea of a unitary \r\npsychosis, defined by a variety of symptoms.  A positive contribution \r\nof Freudian psychoanalysis (and its congeners and competitors) was that \r\nit made people think in terms of causes and the possibility of cures, \r\ninstead of hopelessness, stigmatization, isolation and eradication. \r\nAlthough Freud expressed the thought that biological causes and cures \r\nwould eventually be found, the profession he founded was not sympathetic \r\nto the idea of physiological therapies.Looking \r\nfor general physiological problems behind the various symptoms is very \r\ndifferent from the practice of classifying the insanities according \r\nto their symptoms and the hypothetical brain chemicals that are \r\nbelieved to cause the symptoms. The fact that some patients hallucinate \r\ncaused many psychiatrists to believe that hallucinogenic chemicals, \r\ninterfering with nerve transmitter substances such as dopamine or serotonin, \r\nwere going to provide insight into psychotic states. The dopamine excess \r\n(or serotonin deficiency) theories developed at a time when only a few \r\ntransmitter substances were known, and when they were thought \r\nto act as very specific on/off nerve switches, rather than as links \r\nin metabolic networks. The drug industry helps to keep those ideas alive.The idea \r\nthat the brain is like a computer, and that the nerves are like wires \r\nand switches, is behind all of the theories about transmitter substances \r\nand synapses. If this metaphor about the nature of the brain and the \r\norganism is fundamentally wrong, then the theories of schizophrenia \r\nbased on nerve transmitter substances can hardly be right.  Another \r\ntheory of schizophrenia based on the computer metaphor has to do with \r\nthe idea that nerve cells wire-like and switch-like functions depend \r\non their membranes, and, in the most popular version, that these all-important \r\nmembranes are made of fish oil.  The supporting evidence is supposed \r\nto be that the fish-oil-like fatty acids are depleted from the tissues \r\nof schizophrenics. Just looking at that point, the evidence is \r\nmore likely to be the result of stress, which depletes unsaturated fatty \r\nacids, especially of the specified type, in producing lipid peroxides \r\nand other toxic molecules.In one \r\nof its variations, the essential fatty acid deficiency doctrine \r\nsuggests that a certain prostaglandin deficiency is the cause of schizophrenia, \r\nbut experiments have shown that anexcessof that prostaglandin mimics the symptoms of psychosis.The drug industrys effect on the way the organism is commonly understood \r\nhas been pervasively pathological.  For example, the dogma about \r\ncell surface receptors has sometimes explicitly led people to \r\nsay that the brain chemicals are activeonlyat the surface of cells, and not inside the cells.The consequences of this mistake have been catastrophic.  For \r\nexample, serotonins precursor, tryptophan, and the drugs called serotonin \r\nreuptake inhibitors, and other serotonergic drugs, and serotonin \r\nitself, are carcinogenic and/or tumor promoters. Excessive serotonin \r\nis a major factor in kidney and heart failure, liver and lung disease, \r\nstroke, pituitary abnormalities, inflammatory diseases, practically \r\nevery kind of sickness, at the beginning, middle, and end of life. In \r\nthe brain, serotonin regulates circulation and mitochondrial function, \r\ntemperature, respiration and appetite, alertness and learning, secretion \r\nof prolactin, growth hormones and stress hormones, and participates \r\nin the most complex biochemical webs.  But the pharmaceutical industrys \r\nmyth has led people to believe that serotonin is the chemical of happiness, \r\nand that tryptophan is its benign nutritional precursor, and that they \r\nare going to harmlessly influence the receptors on nerve membranes.A particular drug has many effects other than those that are commonly \r\nrecognized as its mechanism of action, but when an antidepressant \r\nor a tranquilizer or a serotonin reuptake inhibitor alleviates \r\na particular condition, some people argue that the condition must have \r\nbeen caused by the specific chemistry that the drug is thought \r\nto affect.  Because of the computer metaphor for the brain, these \r\neffects are commonly thought to be primarily in the synapses, the membranes, \r\nand the transmitter chemicals.The argument for a genetic cause of schizophrenia relies heavily \r\non twin studies in which the frequency of both twins being schizophrenic \r\nis contrasted to the normal incidence of schizophrenia in the population, \r\nwhich is usually about 1%.  There is a concordance of 30% to 40% \r\nbetween monozygotic (identical) twins, and a 5% to 10% concordance between \r\nfraternal twins, and both of these rates are higher than that of other \r\nsiblings in the same family. That argument neglects the closer similarity \r\nof the intrauterine conditions experienced by twins, for example the \r\nsharing of the same placenta, and experiencing more concordant biochemical \r\ninteractions between fetus and mother.Defects of the brain, head, face, and even hands and fingerprints \r\nare seen more frequently in the genetically identical twin who later \r\ndevelops schizophrenia than  the twin who doesnt develop schizophrenia.  \r\nOf the twins, it is the baby with the lower birth weight and head size \r\nthat is at a greater risk of developing schizophrenia.Oliver Gillie (in his book,Who Do You Think You Are?)discussed some of the fraud that has occurred in twin studies, but \r\nno additional fraud is needed when the non-genetic explanation is simply \r\nignored and excluded from discussion.  The editors of most medical \r\nand scientific journals are so convinced of the reality of genetic determination \r\nthat they wont allow their readers to see criticisms of it.Prenatal malnutriton or hormonal stress or other stresses are known \r\nto damage the brain, and especially its most highly evolved and metabolically \r\nactive frontal lobes, and to reduce its growth, relative to the rest \r\nof the body.The standard medical explanation for the association of pregnancy \r\ntoxemia and eclampsia with birth defects has been, until recently, that \r\nboth mother and child were genetically inferior, and that the defective \r\nchild created the pregnancy sickness.  The same reasoning \r\nhas been invoked to explain the association of birth complications with \r\nlater disease:The defective \r\nbaby was thecauseof a difficult birth.  That argument has \r\nrecently been discredited (McNeil and Cantor-Graae, 1999).Schizophrenics are known to have had a higher \r\nrate of obstetrical complications, including oxygen deprivation and \r\nCesarian deliveries, than normal people.  Like people with Alzheimers \r\ndisease, the circumference of their heads at birth was small, in proportion \r\nto their body weight and gestational age.Animal studies show that perinatal brain problems \r\ntend to persist, influencing the brains metabolism and function in \r\nadulthood.Like the other major brain diseases, shizophrenia \r\ninvolves a low metabolic rate in crucial parts of the brain. In schizophrenics, \r\nhypofrontality, low metabolism of the frontal lobes, is characteristic, \r\nalong with abnormal balance between the hemispheres, and other regional \r\nimbalances.A very important form of prenatal stress occurs \r\nin toxemia and preeclampsia, in which estrogen is dominant, and endotoxin \r\nand serotonin create a stress reaction with hypertension and impaired \r\nblood circulation to the uterus and placenta.The brain, just like any organ or tissue, is an \r\nenergy-producing metabolic system, and its oxidative metabolism is extremely \r\nintense, and it is more dependent on oxygen for continuous normal functioning \r\nthan any other organ.  Without oxygen, its characteristic functioning \r\n(consciousness) stops instantly (when blood flow stops, blindness begins \r\nin about three seconds, and other responses stop after a few more seconds).  \r\nThe concentration of ATP, which is called the cellular energy molecule, \r\ndoesnt decrease immediately. Nothing detectable happens to the neurotransmitters, \r\nsynapses, or membrane structures in this short period;consciousness is a metabolic process that, in the computer metaphor, \r\nwould be the flow of electrons itself, under the influence of an electromotive \r\nforce, a complex but continuous sort of electromagnetic field.  \r\nThe computer metaphor would seem to have little to offer for understanding \r\nthe brain.In this context, I think its necessary, for \r\nthe present, to ignore the diagnostic details, the endless variety of \r\nqualifications of the idea of schizophrenia, that fill the literature. \r\nThose diagnostic concepts seem to tempt people to look for the precise \r\ncause of this particular subcategory of schizophrenia, and to believe \r\nthat a specific drug or combination of drugs will be found to treat \r\nit, while encouraging them to ignore the patients physiology and \r\nhistory.If we use the standard medical terms at all, it \r\nshould be with the recognition that they are, in their present and historical \r\nform, not scientifically meaningful.The idea that schizophrenia is a disease in itself \r\ntends to distract attention from the things it has in common with Alzheimers \r\ndisease, autism, depression, mania, the manic-depressive syndrome, the \r\nhyperactivity-attention deficit syndrome, and many other physical and \r\nmental problems.  When brain abnormalities are found in schizophrenics \r\nbut not in their normal siblings, it could be tempting to see the abnormalities \r\nas the cause of schizophrenia, unless we see similar abnormalities \r\nin a variety of sicknesses.For the present, its best to think first in \r\nthe most general terms possible, such as a brain stress syndrome, \r\nwhich will include brain aging, stroke, altitude sickness, seizures, \r\nmalnutrition, poisoning, the despair brought on by inescapable stress, \r\nand insomnia, which are relatively free of culturally arbitrary definitions.  \r\nDifficulty in learning, remembering, and analyzing are objective enough \r\nthat it could be useful to see what they have to do with a brain \r\nstress syndrome.Stress damages the energy producing systems of \r\ncells, especially the aerobic mitochondria, in many ways, and this damage \r\ncan often be repaired. The insanities that are most often called schizophrenia \r\ntend to occur in late adolescence, or around menopause, or in old age, \r\nwhich are times of stress, especially hormonal stress.  Post-partum \r\npsychosis often has features that resemble schizophrenia.Although the prenatal factors that predispose \r\na person toward the brain stress syndrome, and those that trigger specific \r\nsymptoms later in life, might seem to be utterly different, the hormonal \r\nand biochemical reactions are probably closely related, involving the \r\nadaptive responses of various functional systems to the problem of insufficient \r\nadaptive ability and inadequate energy.By considering cellular energy production, local \r\nblood flow, and the systemic support system, we can get insight into \r\nsome of the biochemical events that are involved in therapies that are \r\nsometimes successful. A unified concept of health and disease will help \r\nto understand both the origins and the appropriate treatments for a \r\ngreat variety of brain stress syndromes.The simple availability of oxygen, and the ability \r\nto use it, are regulated by carbon dioxide and serotonin, which act \r\nin opposite directions. Carbon dioxide inhibits the release of serotonin.  \r\nCarbon dioxide and serotonin are regulated most importantly by thyroid \r\nfunction. Hypothyroidism is characterized by increased levels of both \r\nnoradrenalin and serotonin, and of other stress-related hormones, including \r\ncortisol and estrogen.  Estrogen shifts the balance of the neurotransmitters \r\nin the same direction, toward increased serotonin and adrenalin, for \r\nexample by inhibiting enzymes that degrade the monoamine neurotransmitters.When an animal such as a squirrel approaches hibernation \r\nand is producing less carbon dioxide, the decrease in carbon dioxide \r\nreleases serotonin, which slows respiration, lowers temperature, suppresses \r\nappetite, and produces torpor.But in energy-deprived humans, increases of adrenalin \r\noppose the hibernation reaction, alter energy production and the ability \r\nto relax, and to sleep deeply and with restorative effect.In several ways, torpor is the opposite of sleep.  \r\nRapid eye movement (REM), that occurs at intervals during sleep and \r\nin association with increased respiration, disappears when the brain \r\nof a hibernating animal falls below a certain temperature.  But \r\ntorpor isnt like non-REM deep sleep, and in fact seems to belike wakefulness,in the sense that a sleep-debt is incurred:Hibernating animals periodically come out of torpor so they can sleep, \r\nand in those periods, when their temperature rises sharply, they have \r\na very high percentage of deep slow wave sleep.Although it is common to speak of sleep and hibernation \r\nas variations on the theme of economizing on energy expenditure, I suspect \r\nthat nocturnal sleep has the special function of minimizing the stress \r\nof darkness itself, and that it has subsidiary functions, including \r\nits now well confirmed role in the consolidation and organization of \r\nmemory. This view of sleep is consistent with observations that disturbed \r\nsleep is associated with obesity, and that the torpor-hibernation chemical, \r\nserotonin, powerfully interferes with learning.Babies spend most of their time sleeping, and \r\nduring life the amount of time spent sleeping decreases, with nightly \r\nsleeping time decreasing by about half an hour per decade after middle \r\nage. Babies have an extremely high metabolic rate and a stable temperature.  \r\nWith age the metabolic rate progressively declines, and as a result \r\nthe ability to maintain an adequate body temperature tends to decrease \r\nwith aging.(The simple fact that body temperature regulates \r\nall organic functions, including brain waves, is habitually overlooked.  \r\nThe actions of a drug on brain waves, for example, may be mediated by \r\nits effects on body temperature, but this wouldnt be very interesting \r\nto pharmacologists looking for transmitter-specific drugs.)Torpor is the opposite of restful sleep, and with \r\naging, depression, hypothyroidism, and a variety of brain syndromes, \r\nsleep tends toward the hypothermic torpor.An individual cell behaves analogously to the \r\nwhole person. A babys high energy resting state is paralleled \r\nby the stable condition of a cell that is abundantly charged with energy;ATP and carbon dioxide are at high levels in these cells. Progesterones \r\neffects on nerve cells include favoring the high energy resting state, \r\nand this is closely involved in progesterones thermogenic effect, \r\nin which it raises the temperature set-point.The basal metabolic rate, which is mainly governed \r\nby thyroid, roughly corresponds to the average body temperature. However, \r\nin hypothyroidism, there is an adaptive increase in the activity of \r\nthe sympathetic nervous system, producing more adrenalin, which helps \r\nto maintain body temperature by causing vasoconstriction in the skin. \r\nIn aging, menopause, and various stressful conditions, the increased \r\nadrenalin (and the increased cortisol production which is produced by \r\nexcess adrenalin) causes a tendency to wake more easily, and to have \r\nless restful sleep.While the early morning body temperature will \r\nsometimes be low in hypothyroidism, I have found many exceptions to \r\nthis. In protein deficiency, sodium deficiency, in menopause with flushing \r\nsymptoms, and in both phases of the manic depression cycle, and in some \r\nschizophrenics, the morning temperature is high, corresponding to very \r\nhigh levels of adrenalin and cortisol.  Taking the temperature \r\nbefore and after breakfast will show a reduction of temperature, the \r\nopposite of what occurs in simple hypothyroidism, because raising the \r\nblood sugar permits the adrenalin and cortisol to fall.The characteristic sleep pattern of hypothyroidism \r\nand old age is similar to the pattern seen in schizophrenia and depression, \r\na decrease of deep slow wave sleep. Serotonin, like torpor, produces \r\na similar effect. In other words, a torpor-like state can be seen in \r\nall of these brain-stress states. Several studies have found that anti-serotonin \r\ndrugs improve sleep, and also reduce symptoms of schizophrenia and depression. \r\nIt is common for the neuroleptic drugs to raise body temperature, \r\neven pathologically as in the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.In old people, who lose heat easily during the \r\nday, their extreme increase in the compensatory nervous and hormonal \r\nadrenalin activity causes their night-time heat regulation (vasoconstriction \r\nin the extremities) to rise to normal.Increased body temperature improves sleep, especially \r\nthe deep slow wave sleep. A hot bath, or even warming the feet, has \r\nthe same effect as thyroid in improving sleep. Salty and sugary foods \r\ntaken at bedtime, or during the night, help to improve the quality and \r\nduration of sleep. Both salt and sugar lower the adrenalin level, and \r\nboth tend to raise the body temperature.Hypothyroidism tends to cause the blood and other \r\nbody fluids to be deficient in both sodium and glucose. Consuming salty \r\ncarbohydrate foods momentarily makes up to some extent for the thyroid \r\ndeficiency.In the peiodic table of the elements, lithium \r\nis immediately above sodium, meaning that it has the chemical properties \r\nof sodium, but with a smaller atomic radius, which makes its electrical \r\ncharge more intense. Its physiological effects are so close to sodiums \r\nthat we can get clues to sodiums actions by watching what lithium \r\ndoes.Chronic consumption of lithium blocks the release \r\nof adrenalin from the adrenal glands, and it also has extensive antiserotonin \r\neffects, inhibiting its release from some sites, and blocking its actions \r\nat others.Lithium forms a complex with the ammonia molecule, \r\nand since the ammonia molecule mimics the effects of serotonin, especially \r\nin fatigue, this could be involved in lithiums antiserotonergic effects. \r\nAmmonia, like serotonin, impairs mitochondrial energy production (at \r\na minimum, it uses energy in being converted to urea), so anti-ammonia, \r\nanti-serotonin agents make more energy available for adaptation.  \r\nLithium has been demonstrated to restore the energy metabolism of mitochondria \r\n(Gulidova, 1977).Therapies that have been successful in treating \r\nschizophrenia include penicillin, sleep therapy, hyperbaric oxygen, \r\ncarbon dioxide therapy, thyroid, acetazolamide, lithium and vitamins. \r\nThese all make fundamental contributions to the restoration of biological \r\nenergy.  Antibiotics, for example, lower endotoxin formation in \r\nthe intestine, protect against the induction by endotoxin of serotonin, \r\nhistamine, estrogen, and cortisol. Acetazolamide causes the tissues \r\nto retain carbon dioxide, and increased carbon dioxide acidifies cells, \r\npreventing serotonin secretion.REFERENCESGen Pharmacol 1994 Oct;25(6):1257-1262.Serotonin-induced decrease in brain ATP, stimulation of brain anaerobic \r\nglycolysis and elevation of plasma hemoglobin; the protective action \r\nof calmodulin antagonists.Koren-Schwartzer N, Chen-Zion M, Ben-Porat H, \r\nBeitner R Department of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, \r\nIsrael.1.

The resting \r\nheart rate helps to interpret the temperature. In a cool environment, \r\nthe temperature of the extremities is sometimes a better indicator than \r\nthe oral or eardrum temperature.The \r\nbasal metabolic rate, especially if the rate of carbon dioxide \r\nproduction is measured, is very useful. The amount of water and calories \r\ndisposed of in a day can give a rough idea of the metabolic rate.The \r\nT wave on the electrocardiogram, and the relaxation rate on the Achilles \r\nreflex test are useful.Blood \r\ntests for cholesterol, albumin, glucose, sodium, lactate, total thyroxine \r\nand total T3 are useful to know, because they help to evaluate the present \r\nthyroid status, and sometimes they can suggest ways to correct the problem.Less \r\ncommon blood or urine tests (adrenaline, cortisol, ammonium, free fatty \r\nacids), if they are available, can help to understand compensatory reactions \r\nto hypothyroidism.A \r\nbook such as McGavack'sThe Thyroid,that provides traditional \r\nmedical knowledge about thyroid physiology, can help to dispel some \r\nof the current dogmas about the thyroid.Using \r\nmore physiologically relevant methods to diagnose hypothyroidism will \r\ncontribute to understanding its role in many problems now considered \r\nto be unrelated to the thyroid.======================================I \r\nhave spoken to several people who told me that their doctors had diagnosed \r\nthem as both hypothyroid and hyperthyroid. Although physicists \r\ncan believe in things which are simultaneously both particles and not \r\nparticles, I think biology (and medicine, as far as it is biologically \r\nbased) should occupy a world in which things are not simultaneously \r\nthemselves and their opposites. Those illogical, impossible diagnoses \r\nmake it clear that the rules for interpreting test results have in some \r\nsituations lost touch with reality.Until \r\nthe 1940s, hypothyroidism was diagnosed on the basis of signs and symptoms, \r\nand sometimes the measurement of oxygen consumption (basal metabolic \r\nrate) was used for confirmation. Besides the introduction of supposedly \r\nscientific blood tests, such as the measurement of protein-bound \r\niodine (PBI) in the blood, there were other motives for becoming parsimonious \r\nwith the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. With the introduction of synthetic \r\nthyroxine, one of the arguments for increasing its sale was that natural \r\nArmour thyroid (which was precisely standardized by biological tests) \r\nwasn't properly standardized, and that an overdose could be fatal. A \r\nfew articles in prestigious journals created a myth of the danger of \r\nthyroid, and the synthetic thyroxine was (falsely) said to be precisely \r\nstandardized, and to be without the dangers of the complete glandular \r\nextract.Between \r\n1940 and about 1950, the estimated percentage of hypothyroid Americans \r\nwent from 30% or 40% to 5%, on the basis of the PBI test, and it has \r\nstayed close to that lower number (many publications claim it to be \r\nonly 1% or 2%). By the time that the measurement of PBI was shown to \r\nbe only vaguely related to thyroid hormonal function, it had been in \r\nuse long enough for a new generation of physicians to be taught to disregard \r\nthe older ideas about diagnosing and treating hypothyroidism. They were \r\ntaught to inform their patients that the traditional symptoms that were \r\nidentified as hypothyroidism before 1950 were the result of the patients' \r\nown behavior (sloth and gluttony, for example, which produced fatigue, \r\nobesity, and heart disease), or that the problems were imaginary (women's \r\nhormonal and neurological problems, especially), or that they were simply \r\nmysterious diseases and defects (recurring infections, arthritis, and \r\ncancer, for example).As \r\nthe newer, more direct tests became available, their meaning was defined \r\nin terms of the statistical expectation of hypothyroidism that had become \r\nan integral part of medical culture. To make the new TSH measurements \r\nfit the medical doctrine, an 8- or 10-fold variation in the hormone \r\nwas defined as normal. With any other biological measurement, \r\nsuch as erythrocyte count, blood pressure, body weight, or serum sodium, \r\ncalcium, chloride, or glucose, a variation of ten or 20 percent from \r\nthe mean is considered to be meaningful. If the doctrine regarding the \r\n5% prevalence of hypothyroidism hadn't been so firmly established, there \r\nwould have been more interest in establishing the meaning of these great \r\nvariations in TSH.In \r\nrecent years the normal range for TSH has been decreasing. In \r\n2003, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists changed \r\ntheir guidelines for the normal range to 0.3 to 3.0 microIU/ml. But \r\neven though this lower range is less arbitrary than the older standards, \r\nit still isn't based on an understanding of the physiological meaning \r\nof TSH.Over \r\na period of several years, I never saw a person whose TSH was over 2 \r\nmicroIU/ml who was comfortably healthy, and I formed the impression \r\nthat the normal, or healthy, quantity was probably something less than \r\n1.0.If \r\na pathologically high TSH is defined as normal, its role in major diseases, \r\nsuch as breast cancer, mastalgia, MS, fibrotic diseases, and epilepsy, \r\nwill simply be ignored. Even if the possibility is considered, the use \r\nof an irrational norm, instead of a proper comparison, such as the statistical \r\ndifference between the mean TSH levels of cases and controls, leads \r\nto denial of an association between hypothyroidism and important diseases, \r\ndespite evidence that indicates an association.Some \r\ncritics have said that most physicians are treating the TSH, rather \r\nthan the patient. If TSH is itself pathogenic, because of its pro-inflammatory \r\nactions, then that approach isn't entirely useless, even when they treat \r\nthe TSH with only thyroxine, which often isn't well converted into \r\nthe active triiodothyronine, T3. But the relief of a few symptoms in \r\na small percentage of the population is serving to blind the medical \r\nworld to the real possibilities of thyroid therapy.TSH \r\nhas direct actions on many cell types other than the thyroid, and probably \r\ncontributes directly to edema (Wheatley and Edwards, 1983), fibrosis, \r\nand mastocytosis. If people are concerned about the effects of a TSH \r\ndeficiency, then I think they have to explain the remarkable longevity \r\nof the animals lacking pituitaries in W.D. Denckla's experiments, or \r\nof the naturally pituitary deficient dwarf mice that lack TSH, prolactin, \r\nand growth hormone, but live about a year longer than normal mice (Heiman, \r\net al., 2003). Until there is evidence that very low TSH is somehow \r\nharmful, there is no basis for setting a lower limit to the normal range.Some \r\ntypes of thyroid cancer can usually be controlled by keeping TSH completely \r\nsuppressed. Since TSH produces reactions in cells as different as fibroblasts \r\nand fat cells, pigment cells in the skin, mast cells and bone marrow \r\ncells (Whetsell, et al., 1999), it won't be surprising if it turns out \r\nto have a role in the development of a variety of cancers, including \r\nmelanoma.Many \r\nthings, including the liver and the senses, regulate the function of \r\nthe thyroid system, and the pituitary is just one of the factors affecting \r\nthe synthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones.A \r\nfew people who had extremely low levels of pituitary hormones, and were \r\ntold that they must take several hormone supplements for the rest of \r\ntheir life, began producing normal amounts of those hormones within \r\na few days of  eating more protein and fruit. Their endocrinologist \r\ndescribed them as, effectively, having no pituitary gland. Extreme malnutrition \r\nin Africa has been described as creating . . . a condition resembling \r\nhypophysectomy, (Ingenbleek and Beckers, 1975) but the people I talked \r\nto in Oregon were just following what they thought were healthful nutritional \r\npolicies, avoiding eggs and sugars, and eating soy products.Occasionally, \r\na small supplement of thyroid in addition to a good diet is needed to \r\nquickly escape from the stress-induced hypophysectomized condition.Aging, \r\ninfection, trauma, prolonged cortisol excess, somatostatin, dopamine \r\nor L-dopa, adrenaline (sometimes; Mannisto, et al., 1979), amphetamine, \r\ncaffeine and fever can lower TSH, apart from the effect of feedback \r\nby the thyroid hormones, creating a situation in which TSH can appear \r\nnormal or low, at the same time that there is a real hypothyroidism.A \r\ndisease or its treatment can obscure the presence of hypothyroidism. \r\nParkinson's disease is a clear example of this. (Garcia-Moreno and Chacon, \r\n2002: ... in the same way hypothyroidism can simulate Parkinson's \r\ndisease, the latter can also conceal hypothyroidism.)The \r\nstress-induced suppression of TSH and other pituitary hormones is reminiscent \r\nof the protective inhibition that occurs in individual nerve fibers \r\nduring dangerously intense stress, and might involve such a parabiotic \r\nprocess in the nerves of the hypothalamus or other brain region. The \r\nrelative disappearance of the pituitary hormones when the organism is \r\nin very good condition (for example, the suppression of ACTH and cortisol \r\nby sugar or pregnenolone) is parallel to the high energy quiescence \r\nof individual nerve fibers.These \r\nassociations between energy state and cellular activity can be used \r\nfor evaluating the thyroid state, as in measuring nerve and muscle reaction \r\ntimes and relaxation rates. For example, relaxation which is retarded, \r\nbecause of slow restoration of the energy needed for cellular repolarization, \r\nis the basis for the traditional use of the Achilles tendon reflex relaxation \r\ntest for diagnosing hypothyroidism. The speed of relaxation of the heart \r\nmuscle also indicates thyroid status (Mohr-Kahaly, et al., 1996).Stress, \r\nbesides suppressing the TSH, acts in other ways to suppress the real \r\nthyroid function. Cortisol, for example, inhibits the conversion of \r\nT4 to T3, which is responsible for the respiratory production of energy \r\nand carbon dioxide. Adrenaline, besides leading to increased production \r\nof cortisol, is lipolytic, releasing the fatty acids which, if they \r\nare polyunsaturated, inhibit the production and transport of thyroid \r\nhormone, and also interfere directly with the respiratory functions \r\nof the mitochondria. Adrenaline decreases the conversion to T4 to T3, \r\nand increases the formation of the antagonistic reverse T3 (Nauman, \r\net al., 1980, 1984).During \r\nthe night, at the time adrenaline and free fatty acids are at their \r\nhighest, TSH usually reaches its peak.TSH itself can produce \r\nlipolysis, raising the level of circulating free fatty acids. This suggests \r\nthat a high level of TSH could sometimes contribute to functional hypothyroidism, \r\nbecause of the antimetabolic effects of the unsaturated fatty acids.These \r\nare the basic reasons for thinking that the TSH tests should be given \r\nonly moderate weight in interpreting thyroid function.The \r\nmetabolic rate is very closely related to thyroid hormone function, \r\nbut defining it and measuring it have to be done with awareness of its \r\ncomplexity.The \r\nbasal metabolic rate that was commonly used in the 1930s for diagnosing \r\nthyroid disorders was usually a measurement of the rate of oxygen consumption, \r\nmade while lying quietly early in the morning without having eaten anything \r\nfor several hours. When carbon dioxide production can be measured at \r\nthe same time as oxygen consumption, it's possible to estimate the proportion \r\nof energy that is being derived from glucose, rather than fat or protein, \r\nsince oxidation of glucose produces more carbon dioxide than oxidation \r\nof fat does. Glucose oxidation is efficient, and suggests a state of \r\nlow stress.The \r\nvery high adrenaline that sometimes occurs in hypothyroidism will increase \r\nthe metabolic rate in several ways, but it tends to increase the oxidation \r\nof fat. If the production of carbon dioxide is measured, the adrenaline/stress \r\ncomponent of metabolism will be minimized in the measurement. When polyunsaturated \r\nfats are mobilized, their spontaneous peroxidation consumes some oxygen, \r\nwithout producing any usable energy or carbon dioxide, so this is another \r\nreason that the production of carbon dioxide is a very good indicator \r\nof thyroid hormone activity. The measurement of oxygen consumption was \r\nusually done for two minutes, and carbon dioxide production could be \r\naccurately measured in a similarly short time. Even a measurement of \r\nthe percentage of carbon dioxide at the end of a single breath can give \r\nan indication of the stress-free, thyroid hormone stimulated rate of \r\nmetabolism (it should approach five or six percent of the expired air).Increasingly \r\nin the last several years, people who have many of the standard symptoms \r\nof hypothyroidism have told me that they are hyperthyroid, and that \r\nthey have to decide whether to have surgery or radiation to destroy \r\ntheir thyroid gland. They have told me that their symptoms of hyperthyroidism, \r\naccording to their physicians, were fatigue, weakness, irritability, \r\npoor memory, and insomnia.They \r\ndidn't eat very much. They didn't sweat noticeably, and they drank a \r\nmoderate amount of fluids. Their pulse rates and body temperature were \r\nnormal, or a little low.Simply \r\non the basis of some laboratory tests, they were going to have their \r\nthyroid gland destroyed. But on the basis of all of the traditional \r\nways of judging thyroid function, they were hypothyroid.Broda \r\nBarnes, who worked mostly in Fort Collins, Colorado, argued that the \r\nbody temperature, measured before getting out of bed in the morning, \r\nwas the best basis for diagnosing thyroid function.Fort \r\nCollins, at a high altitude, has a cool climate most of the year. The \r\naltitude itself helps the thyroid to function normally. For example, \r\none study (Savourey, et al., 1998)  showed an 18% increase in T3 \r\nat a high altitude, and mitochondria become more numerous and are more \r\nefficient at preventing lactic acid production, capillary leakiness, \r\netc.In \r\nEugene during a hot and humid summer, I saw several obviously hypothyroid \r\npeople whose temperature seemed perfectly normal, euthyroid by Barnes' \r\nstandards. But I noticed that their pulse rates were, in several cases, \r\nvery low. It takes very little metabolic energy to keep the body at \r\n98.6 degrees when the air temperature is in the nineties. In cooler \r\nweather, I began asking people whether they used electric blankets, \r\nand ignored their temperature measurements if they did.The \r\ncombination of pulse rate and temperature is much better than either \r\none alone. I happened to see two people whose resting pulse rates were \r\nchronically extremely high, despite their hypothyroid symptoms. When \r\nthey took a thyroid supplement, their pulse rates came down to normal. \r\n(Healthy and intelligent groups of people have been found to have an \r\naverage resting pulse rate of 85/minute, while less healthy groups average \r\nclose to 70/minute.)The \r\nspeed of the pulse is partly determined by adrenaline, and many hypothyroid \r\npeople compensate with very high adrenaline production. Knowing that \r\nhypothyroid people are susceptible to hypoglycemia, and that hypoglycemia \r\nincreases adrenaline, I found that many people had normal (and sometimes \r\nfaster than average) pulse rates when they woke up in the morning, and \r\nwhen they got hungry. Salt, which helps to maintain blood sugar, also \r\ntends to lower adrenalin, and hypothyroid people often lose salt too \r\neasily in their urine and sweat. Measuring the pulse rate before and \r\nafter breakfast, and in the afternoon, can give a good impression of \r\nthe variations in adrenalin. (The blood pressure, too, will show the \r\neffects of adrenaline in hypothyroid people. Hypothyroidism is a major \r\ncause of hypertension.)But \r\nhypoglycemia also tends to decrease the conversion of T4 to T3, so heat \r\nproduction often decreases when a person is hungry. First, their fingers, \r\ntoes, and nose will get cold, because adrenalin, or adrenergic sympathetic \r\nnervous activity, will increase to keep the brain and heart at a normal \r\ntemperature, by reducing circulation to the skin and extremities. Despite \r\nthe temperature-regulating effect of adrenalin, the reduced heat production \r\nresulting from decreased T3 will make a person susceptible to hypothermia \r\nif the environment is cool.Since \r\nfood, especially carbohydrate and protein, will increase blood sugar \r\nand T3 production, eating is thermogenic, and the oral (or eardrum) \r\ntemperature is likely to rise after eating.Blood \r\nsugar falls at night, and the body relies on the glucose stored in the \r\nliver as glycogen for energy, and hypothyroid people store very little \r\nsugar. As a result, adrenalin and cortisol begin to rise almost as soon \r\nas a person goes to bed, and in hypothyroid people, they rise very high, \r\nwith the adrenalin usually peaking around 1 or 2 A.M., and the cortisol \r\npeaking around dawn; the high cortisol raises blood sugar as morning \r\napproaches, and allows adrenalin to decline. Some people wake up during \r\nthe adrenalin peak with a pounding heart, and have trouble getting back \r\nto sleep unless they eat something.If \r\nthe night-time stress is very high, the adrenalin will still be high \r\nuntil breakfast, increasing both temperature and pulse rate. The cortisol \r\nstimulates the breakdown of muscle tissue and its conversion to energy, \r\nso it is thermogenic, for some of the same reasons that food is thermogenic.After \r\neating breakfast, the cortisol (and adrenalin, if it stayed high despite \r\nthe increased cortisol) will start returning to a more normal, lower \r\nlevel, as the blood sugar is sustained by food, instead of by the stress \r\nhormones. In some hypothyroid people, this is a good time to measure \r\nthe temperature and pulse rate. In a normal person, both temperature \r\nand pulse rate rise after breakfast, but in very hypothyroid people \r\neither, or both, might fall.Some \r\nhypothyroid people have a very slow pulse, apparently because they aren't \r\ncompensating with a large production of adrenalin. When they eat, the \r\nliver's increased production of T3 is likely to increase both their \r\ntemperature and their pulse rate.By \r\nwatching the temperature and pulse rate at different times of day, especially \r\nbefore and after meals, it's possible to separate some of the effects \r\nof stress from the thyroid-dependent, relatively basal metabolic \r\nrate. When beginning to take a thyroid supplement, it's important to \r\nkeep a chart of these measurements for at least two weeks, since that's \r\nroughly the half-life of thyroxine in the body. When the body has accumulated \r\na steady level of the hormones, and begun to function more fully, the \r\nfactors such as adrenaline that have been chronically distorted to compensate \r\nfor hypothyroidism will have begun to normalize, and the early effects \r\nof the supplementary thyroid will in many cases seem to disappear, with \r\nheart rate and temperature declining. The daily dose of thyroid often \r\nhas to be increased several times, as the state of stress and the adrenaline \r\nand cortisol production decrease.Counting \r\ncalories achieves approximately the same thing as measuring oxygen consumption, \r\nand is something that will allow people to evaluate the various thyroid \r\ntests they may be given by their doctor. Although food intake and metabolic \r\nrate vary from day to day, an approximate calorie count for several \r\ndays can often make it clear that a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is \r\nmistaken. If a person is eating only about 1800 calories per day, and \r\nhas a steady and normal body weight, any hyperthyroidism is strictly \r\nmetaphysical, or as they say, clinical.When \r\nthe humidity and temperature are normal, a person evaporates about a \r\nliter of water for every 1000 calories metabolized. Eating 2000 calories \r\nper day, a normal person will take in about four liters of liquid, and \r\nform about two liters of urine. A hyperthyroid person will invisibly \r\nlose several quarts of water in a day, and a hypothyroid person may \r\nevaporate a quart or less.When \r\ncells, because of a low metabolic rate, don't easily return to their \r\nthoroughly energized state after they have been stimulated, they tend \r\nto take up water, or, in the case of blood vessels, to become excessively \r\npermeable. Fatigued muscles swell noticeably, and chronically fatigued \r\nnerves can swell enough to cause them to be compressed by the surrounding \r\nconnective tissues. The energy and hydration state of cells can be detected \r\nin various ways, including magnetic resonance, and electrical impedance, \r\nbut functional tests are easy and practical.With \r\nsuitable measuring instruments, the effects of hypothyroidism can be \r\nseen as slowed conduction along nerves, and slowed recovery and readiness \r\nfor new responses. Slow reaction time is associated with slowed memory, \r\nperception, and other mental processes. Some of these nervous deficits \r\ncan be remedied slightly just by raising the core temperature and providing \r\nsuitable nutrients, but the active thyroid hormone, T3 is mainly responsible \r\nfor maintaining the temperature, the nutrients, and the intracellular \r\nrespiratory energy production.In \r\nnerves, as in other cells, the ability to rest and repair themselves \r\nincreases with the proper level of thyroid hormone. In some cells, the \r\nenergized stability produced by the thyroid hormones prevents inflammation \r\nor an immunological hyperactivity. In the 1950s, shortly after it was \r\nidentified as a distinct substance, T3 was found to be anti-inflammatory, \r\nand both T4 and T3 have a variety of anti-inflammatory actions, besides \r\nthe suppression of the pro-inflammatory TSH.Because \r\nthe actions of T3 can be inhibited by many factors, including polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids, reverse T3, and excess thyroxine, the absolute level of \r\nT3 can't be used by itself for diagnosis. Free T3 or free T4 \r\nis a laboratory concept, and the biological activity of T3 doesn't necessarily \r\ncorrespond to its freedom in the test. T3 bound to its transport \r\nproteins can be demonstrated to enter cells, mitochondria, and nuclei. \r\nTransthyretin, which carries both vitamin A and thyroid hormones, is \r\nsharply decreased by stress, and should probably be regularly measured \r\nas part of the thyroid examination.When \r\nT3 is metabolically active, lactic acid won't be produced unnecessarily, \r\nso the measurement of lactate in the blood is a useful test for interpreting \r\nthyroid function. Cholesterol is used rapidly under the influence of \r\nT3, and ever since the 1930s it has been clear that serum cholesterol \r\nrises in hypothyroidism, and is very useful diagnostically. Sodium, \r\nmagnesium, calcium, potassium, creatinine, albumin, glucose, and other \r\ncomponents of the serum are regulated by the thyroid hormones, and can \r\nbe used along with the various functional tests for evaluating thyroid \r\nfunction.Stereotypes \r\nare important. When a very thin person with high blood pressure visits \r\na doctor, hypothyroidism isn't likely to be considered; even high TSH \r\nand very low T4 and T3 are likely to be ignored, because of the stereotypes. \r\n(And if those tests were in the healthy range, the person would be at \r\nrisk for the hyperthyroid diagnosis.) But remembering some of \r\nthe common adaptive reactions to a thyroid deficiency, the catabolic \r\neffects of high cortisol and the circulatory disturbance caused by high \r\nadrenaline should lead to doing some of the appropriate tests, instead \r\nof treating the person's hypertension and under nourished condition.REFERENCESClin Chem Lab Med. 2002 Dec;40(12):1344-8.Transthyretin: its response \r\nto malnutrition and stress injury.

Serum concentrations of total thyroxine \r\nand triiodothyronine and of thyroxine-binding proteins were extremely \r\nreduced, and increased progressively during 3 wk of refeeding. The T4:TBG \r\nmolar ratio was initially 0.180 +/- 0.020, and increased progressively, \r\nparallel to the increases in TT4, to 0.344 +/- 0.038 after 21 days (p \r\nless than 0.025).

It \r\nis concluded 1) there is reduced binding of T4 and T3 to TBG in untreated \r\nPEM which takes 2-3 wk to recover; 2) there are methodological differences \r\nin evaluating free T4 levels in PEM; 3)increased \r\nTSH secretion appears to be an integral part of the recovery from PEM.Neuroendocrinology. 1982;35(2):139-47.Neurotransmitter control of thyrotropin secretion.Krulich L. The central dopaminergic system seems to have an inhibitory \r\ninfluence on the secretion of thyrotropin (TSH) both in humans and rats.Endocrinology  1972 Mar;90(3):795-801.TSH-induced release of \r\n5-hydroxytryptamine and histamine rat thyroid mast cells.Ericson \r\nLE, Hakanson R, Melander A, Owman C, Sundler F.Rev \r\nNeurol. 2002 Oct 16-31;35(8):741-2.[Hypothyroidism concealed by \r\nParkinson's disease][in Spanish] Garcia-Moreno JM, Chacon J. Servicio \r\nde Neurologia, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Espana.Sinue@arrakis.esAIMS: Although it is commonly recognised that diseases \r\nof the thyroids can simulate extrapyramidal disorders, a review of the \r\ncauses of Parkinsonism in the neurology literature shows that they are \r\nnot usually mentioned or, if so, only very briefly. The development \r\nof hypothyroidism in a patient with Parkinson s disease can go undetected, \r\nsince the course of both diseases can involve similar clinical features. \r\nGenerally speaking there is always an insistence on the need to conduct \r\na thyroidal hormone study in any patient with symptoms of Parkinson, \r\nbut no emphasis is put on the need to continue to rule out dysthyroidism \r\nthroughout the natural course of the disease, in spite of the fact that \r\nthe concurrence of both pathological conditions can be high and that, \r\nin the same way hypothyroidism can simulate Parkinson s disease, the \r\nlatter can also conceal hypothyroidism. CASE REPORT: We report the case \r\nof a female patient who had been suffering from Parkinson s disease \r\nfor 17 years and started to present on off fluctuations that did not \r\nrespond to therapy. Hypothyroidism was observed and the hormone replacement \r\ntherapy used to resolve the problem allowed the Parkinsonian fluctuations \r\nto be controlled. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that it is very wise to suspect \r\nhypothyroidism in patients known to be suffering from Parkinson s disease, \r\nand especially so in cases where the clinical condition worsens and \r\nsymptoms no longer respond properly to antiparkinsonian treatment. These \r\nobservations stress the possible role played by thyroid hormones in \r\ndopaminergic metabolism and vice versa.Endocrine. 2003 Feb-Mar;20(1-2):149-54.Body composition of prolactin-, \r\ngrowth hormone, and thyrotropin-deficient Ames dwarf mice.Heiman \r\nML, Tinsley FC, Mattison JA, Hauck S, Bartke A.

Department \r\nof Pharmacology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque \r\n87131. A number of neurochemical and behavioral similarities exist between \r\nthe genetically epilepsy-prone (GEPR) rat and rats made hypothyroid \r\nat birth. These similarities include lower brain monoamine levels, audiogenic \r\nseizure susceptibility and lowered electroconvulsive shock seizure threshold. \r\nGiven these similarities, thyroid hormone status was examined in GEPR \r\nrats. Serum samples were collected from GEPR-9 and non-epileptic control \r\nrats at 5, 9, 13, 16, 22, 31, 45, 60, 90, 150 and 350 days of age. Serum \r\nthyroxine (T4) levels were significantly lower in GEPR-9 rats compared \r\nto control until day 22 of age.GEPR-9 thyrotropin (TSH) levels were \r\nsignificantly elevated during the period of diminished serum T4. GEPR-9 \r\ntriiodothyronine (T3) levels were lower than control throughout the \r\nfirst year of life. The data indicate that the GEPR-9 rat is hypothyroid \r\nfrom at least the second week of life up to 1 year of age.

BACKGROUND: Neuropsychological impairment is a common \r\nproblem in epilepsy which interferes with the quality of life of patients. \r\nSimilarly, thyroid hormone levels have been observed to be abnormal \r\nin patients with epilepsy on various treatments. This study aimed to \r\nascertain any possible correlation between neuropsychological performance \r\nand thyroid hormone levels among epilepsy patients. METHODS: Thyroid \r\nhormone levels, indices of neuropsychological performance and social \r\nadaptation of 43 epilepsy patients were compared with those of age- \r\nand sex-matched healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Epilepsy patients \r\nexhibited significantly (p < 0.001) lower scores on attention, memory, \r\nconstructional praxis, finger tapping time, and verbal intelligence \r\nquotient (i.q.) when compared with controls.Their \r\nT3, T4 and Free T3 levels were significantly lower;andTSH and Free T4 levels were significantly higher than that of \r\ncontrols.There was no statistically significant correlation between \r\nthe indices of neuropsychological performance and thyroid hormone levels. \r\nCONCLUSION: We did not observe any correlation between neuropsychological \r\nimpairment and thyroid hormone levels among patients with epilepsy.Crit \r\nCare Med. 1994 Nov;22(11):1747-53.Dopamine suppresses pituitary \r\nfunction in infants and children.Van den Berghe G, de Zegher F, \r\nLauwers P.Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 2000 Jan 1;144(1):5-8.[Epilepsy, disturbances \r\nof behavior and consciousness in presence of normal thyroxine levels: \r\nstill, consider the thyroid gland][Article in Dutch] Vrancken AF, Braun KP, de Valk HW, Rinkel GJ.

All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com Each \r\nof the indicators of thyroid function can be useful, but has to be interpreted \r\nin relation to the physiological state. Increasingly, \r\nTSH (the pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone) has been treated as \r\nif it meant something independently; however, it can be brought down \r\ninto the normal range, or lower, by substances other than the thyroid \r\nhormones. Basal \r\nbody temperature is influenced by many things besides thyroid. The resting \r\nheart rate helps to interpret the temperature. In a cool environment, \r\nthe temperature of the extremities is sometimes a better indicator than \r\nthe oral or eardrum temperature. The \r\nbasal metabolic rate, especially if the rate of carbon dioxide \r\nproduction is measured, is very useful. The amount of water and calories \r\ndisposed of in a day can give a rough idea of the metabolic rate. The \r\nT wave on the electrocardiogram, and the relaxation rate on the Achilles \r\nreflex test are useful. Blood \r\ntests for cholesterol, albumin, glucose, sodium, lactate, total thyroxine \r\nand total T3 are useful to know, because they help to evaluate the present \r\nthyroid status, and sometimes they can suggest ways to correct the problem. Less \r\ncommon blood or urine tests (adrenaline, cortisol, ammonium, free fatty \r\nacids), if they are available, can help to understand compensatory reactions \r\nto hypothyroidism. A \r\nbook such as McGavack'sThe Thyroid,that provides traditional \r\nmedical knowledge about thyroid physiology, can help to dispel some \r\nof the current dogmas about the thyroid. Using \r\nmore physiologically relevant methods to diagnose hypothyroidism will \r\ncontribute to understanding its role in many problems now considered \r\nto be unrelated to the thyroid. ====================================== I \r\nhave spoken to several people who told me that their doctors had diagnosed \r\nthem as both hypothyroid and hyperthyroid. Although physicists \r\ncan believe in things which are simultaneously both particles and not \r\nparticles, I think biology (and medicine, as far as it is biologically \r\nbased) should occupy a world in which things are not simultaneously \r\nthemselves and their opposites. Those illogical, impossible diagnoses \r\nmake it clear that the rules for interpreting test results have in some \r\nsituations lost touch with reality. Until \r\nthe 1940s, hypothyroidism was diagnosed on the basis of signs and symptoms, \r\nand sometimes the measurement of oxygen consumption (basal metabolic \r\nrate) was used for confirmation. Besides the introduction of supposedly \r\nscientific blood tests, such as the measurement of protein-bound \r\niodine (PBI) in the blood, there were other motives for becoming parsimonious \r\nwith the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. With the introduction of synthetic \r\nthyroxine, one of the arguments for increasing its sale was that natural \r\nArmour thyroid (which was precisely standardized by biological tests) \r\nwasn't properly standardized, and that an overdose could be fatal. A \r\nfew articles in prestigious journals created a myth of the danger of \r\nthyroid, and the synthetic thyroxine was (falsely) said to be precisely \r\nstandardized, and to be without the dangers of the complete glandular \r\nextract. Between \r\n1940 and about 1950, the estimated percentage of hypothyroid Americans \r\nwent from 30% or 40% to 5%, on the basis of the PBI test, and it has \r\nstayed close to that lower number (many publications claim it to be \r\nonly 1% or 2%). By the time that the measurement of PBI was shown to \r\nbe only vaguely related to thyroid hormonal function, it had been in \r\nuse long enough for a new generation of physicians to be taught to disregard \r\nthe older ideas about diagnosing and treating hypothyroidism. They were \r\ntaught to inform their patients that the traditional symptoms that were \r\nidentified as hypothyroidism before 1950 were the result of the patients' \r\nown behavior (sloth and gluttony, for example, which produced fatigue, \r\nobesity, and heart disease), or that the problems were imaginary (women's \r\nhormonal and neurological problems, especially), or that they were simply \r\nmysterious diseases and defects (recurring infections, arthritis, and \r\ncancer, for example). As \r\nthe newer, more direct tests became available, their meaning was defined \r\nin terms of the statistical expectation of hypothyroidism that had become \r\nan integral part of medical culture. To make the new TSH measurements \r\nfit the medical doctrine, an 8- or 10-fold variation in the hormone \r\nwas defined as normal. With any other biological measurement, \r\nsuch as erythrocyte count, blood pressure, body weight, or serum sodium, \r\ncalcium, chloride, or glucose, a variation of ten or 20 percent from \r\nthe mean is considered to be meaningful. If the doctrine regarding the \r\n5% prevalence of hypothyroidism hadn't been so firmly established, there \r\nwould have been more interest in establishing the meaning of these great \r\nvariations in TSH. In \r\nrecent years the normal range for TSH has been decreasing. In \r\n2003, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists changed \r\ntheir guidelines for the normal range to 0.3 to 3.0 microIU/ml. But \r\neven though this lower range is less arbitrary than the older standards, \r\nit still isn't based on an understanding of the physiological meaning \r\nof TSH. Over \r\na period of several years, I never saw a person whose TSH was over 2 \r\nmicroIU/ml who was comfortably healthy, and I formed the impression \r\nthat the normal, or healthy, quantity was probably something less than \r\n1.0. If \r\na pathologically high TSH is defined as normal, its role in major diseases, \r\nsuch as breast cancer, mastalgia, MS, fibrotic diseases, and epilepsy, \r\nwill simply be ignored. Even if the possibility is considered, the use \r\nof an irrational norm, instead of a proper comparison, such as the statistical \r\ndifference between the mean TSH levels of cases and controls, leads \r\nto denial of an association between hypothyroidism and important diseases, \r\ndespite evidence that indicates an association. Some \r\ncritics have said that most physicians are treating the TSH, rather \r\nthan the patient. If TSH is itself pathogenic, because of its pro-inflammatory \r\nactions, then that approach isn't entirely useless, even when they treat \r\nthe TSH with only thyroxine, which often isn't well converted into \r\nthe active triiodothyronine, T3. But the relief of a few symptoms in \r\na small percentage of the population is serving to blind the medical \r\nworld to the real possibilities of thyroid therapy. TSH \r\nhas direct actions on many cell types other than the thyroid, and probably \r\ncontributes directly to edema (Wheatley and Edwards, 1983), fibrosis, \r\nand mastocytosis. If people are concerned about the effects of a TSH \r\ndeficiency, then I think they have to explain the remarkable longevity \r\nof the animals lacking pituitaries in W.D. Denckla's experiments, or \r\nof the naturally pituitary deficient dwarf mice that lack TSH, prolactin, \r\nand growth hormone, but live about a year longer than normal mice (Heiman, \r\net al., 2003). Until there is evidence that very low TSH is somehow \r\nharmful, there is no basis for setting a lower limit to the normal range. Some \r\ntypes of thyroid cancer can usually be controlled by keeping TSH completely \r\nsuppressed. Since TSH produces reactions in cells as different as fibroblasts \r\nand fat cells, pigment cells in the skin, mast cells and bone marrow \r\ncells (Whetsell, et al., 1999), it won't be surprising if it turns out \r\nto have a role in the development of a variety of cancers, including \r\nmelanoma. Many \r\nthings, including the liver and the senses, regulate the function of \r\nthe thyroid system, and the pituitary is just one of the factors affecting \r\nthe synthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones. A \r\nfew people who had extremely low levels of pituitary hormones, and were \r\ntold that they must take several hormone supplements for the rest of \r\ntheir life, began producing normal amounts of those hormones within \r\na few days of  eating more protein and fruit. Their endocrinologist \r\ndescribed them as, effectively, having no pituitary gland. Extreme malnutrition \r\nin Africa has been described as creating . . . a condition resembling \r\nhypophysectomy, (Ingenbleek and Beckers, 1975) but the people I talked \r\nto in Oregon were just following what they thought were healthful nutritional \r\npolicies, avoiding eggs and sugars, and eating soy products. Occasionally, \r\na small supplement of thyroid in addition to a good diet is needed to \r\nquickly escape from the stress-induced hypophysectomized condition. Aging, \r\ninfection, trauma, prolonged cortisol excess, somatostatin, dopamine \r\nor L-dopa, adrenaline (sometimes; Mannisto, et al., 1979), amphetamine, \r\ncaffeine and fever can lower TSH, apart from the effect of feedback \r\nby the thyroid hormones, creating a situation in which TSH can appear \r\nnormal or low, at the same time that there is a real hypothyroidism. A \r\ndisease or its treatment can obscure the presence of hypothyroidism. \r\nParkinson's disease is a clear example of this. (Garcia-Moreno and Chacon, \r\n2002: ... in the same way hypothyroidism can simulate Parkinson's \r\ndisease, the latter can also conceal hypothyroidism.) The \r\nstress-induced suppression of TSH and other pituitary hormones is reminiscent \r\nof the protective inhibition that occurs in individual nerve fibers \r\nduring dangerously intense stress, and might involve such a parabiotic \r\nprocess in the nerves of the hypothalamus or other brain region. The \r\nrelative disappearance of the pituitary hormones when the organism is \r\nin very good condition (for example, the suppression of ACTH and cortisol \r\nby sugar or pregnenolone) is parallel to the high energy quiescence \r\nof individual nerve fibers. These \r\nassociations between energy state and cellular activity can be used \r\nfor evaluating the thyroid state, as in measuring nerve and muscle reaction \r\ntimes and relaxation rates. For example, relaxation which is retarded, \r\nbecause of slow restoration of the energy needed for cellular repolarization, \r\nis the basis for the traditional use of the Achilles tendon reflex relaxation \r\ntest for diagnosing hypothyroidism. The speed of relaxation of the heart \r\nmuscle also indicates thyroid status (Mohr-Kahaly, et al., 1996). Stress, \r\nbesides suppressing the TSH, acts in other ways to suppress the real \r\nthyroid function. Cortisol, for example, inhibits the conversion of \r\nT4 to T3, which is responsible for the respiratory production of energy \r\nand carbon dioxide. Adrenaline, besides leading to increased production \r\nof cortisol, is lipolytic, releasing the fatty acids which, if they \r\nare polyunsaturated, inhibit the production and transport of thyroid \r\nhormone, and also interfere directly with the respiratory functions \r\nof the mitochondria. Adrenaline decreases the conversion to T4 to T3, \r\nand increases the formation of the antagonistic reverse T3 (Nauman, \r\net al., 1980, 1984). During \r\nthe night, at the time adrenaline and free fatty acids are at their \r\nhighest, TSH usually reaches its peak.TSH itself can produce \r\nlipolysis, raising the level of circulating free fatty acids. This suggests \r\nthat a high level of TSH could sometimes contribute to functional hypothyroidism, \r\nbecause of the antimetabolic effects of the unsaturated fatty acids. These \r\nare the basic reasons for thinking that the TSH tests should be given \r\nonly moderate weight in interpreting thyroid function. The \r\nmetabolic rate is very closely related to thyroid hormone function, \r\nbut defining it and measuring it have to be done with awareness of its \r\ncomplexity. The \r\nbasal metabolic rate that was commonly used in the 1930s for diagnosing \r\nthyroid disorders was usually a measurement of the rate of oxygen consumption, \r\nmade while lying quietly early in the morning without having eaten anything \r\nfor several hours. When carbon dioxide production can be measured at \r\nthe same time as oxygen consumption, it's possible to estimate the proportion \r\nof energy that is being derived from glucose, rather than fat or protein, \r\nsince oxidation of glucose produces more carbon dioxide than oxidation \r\nof fat does. Glucose oxidation is efficient, and suggests a state of \r\nlow stress. The \r\nvery high adrenaline that sometimes occurs in hypothyroidism will increase \r\nthe metabolic rate in several ways, but it tends to increase the oxidation \r\nof fat. If the production of carbon dioxide is measured, the adrenaline/stress \r\ncomponent of metabolism will be minimized in the measurement. When polyunsaturated \r\nfats are mobilized, their spontaneous peroxidation consumes some oxygen, \r\nwithout producing any usable energy or carbon dioxide, so this is another \r\nreason that the production of carbon dioxide is a very good indicator \r\nof thyroid hormone activity. The measurement of oxygen consumption was \r\nusually done for two minutes, and carbon dioxide production could be \r\naccurately measured in a similarly short time. Even a measurement of \r\nthe percentage of carbon dioxide at the end of a single breath can give \r\nan indication of the stress-free, thyroid hormone stimulated rate of \r\nmetabolism (it should approach five or six percent of the expired air). Increasingly \r\nin the last several years, people who have many of the standard symptoms \r\nof hypothyroidism have told me that they are hyperthyroid, and that \r\nthey have to decide whether to have surgery or radiation to destroy \r\ntheir thyroid gland. They have told me that their symptoms of hyperthyroidism, \r\naccording to their physicians, were fatigue, weakness, irritability, \r\npoor memory, and insomnia. They \r\ndidn't eat very much. They didn't sweat noticeably, and they drank a \r\nmoderate amount of fluids. Their pulse rates and body temperature were \r\nnormal, or a little low. Simply \r\non the basis of some laboratory tests, they were going to have their \r\nthyroid gland destroyed. But on the basis of all of the traditional \r\nways of judging thyroid function, they were hypothyroid. Broda \r\nBarnes, who worked mostly in Fort Collins, Colorado, argued that the \r\nbody temperature, measured before getting out of bed in the morning, \r\nwas the best basis for diagnosing thyroid function. Fort \r\nCollins, at a high altitude, has a cool climate most of the year. The \r\naltitude itself helps the thyroid to function normally. For example, \r\none study (Savourey, et al., 1998)  showed an 18% increase in T3 \r\nat a high altitude, and mitochondria become more numerous and are more \r\nefficient at preventing lactic acid production, capillary leakiness, \r\netc. In \r\nEugene during a hot and humid summer, I saw several obviously hypothyroid \r\npeople whose temperature seemed perfectly normal, euthyroid by Barnes' \r\nstandards. But I noticed that their pulse rates were, in several cases, \r\nvery low. It takes very little metabolic energy to keep the body at \r\n98.6 degrees when the air temperature is in the nineties. In cooler \r\nweather, I began asking people whether they used electric blankets, \r\nand ignored their temperature measurements if they did. The \r\ncombination of pulse rate and temperature is much better than either \r\none alone. I happened to see two people whose resting pulse rates were \r\nchronically extremely high, despite their hypothyroid symptoms. When \r\nthey took a thyroid supplement, their pulse rates came down to normal. \r\n(Healthy and intelligent groups of people have been found to have an \r\naverage resting pulse rate of 85/minute, while less healthy groups average \r\nclose to 70/minute.) The \r\nspeed of the pulse is partly determined by adrenaline, and many hypothyroid \r\npeople compensate with very high adrenaline production. Knowing that \r\nhypothyroid people are susceptible to hypoglycemia, and that hypoglycemia \r\nincreases adrenaline, I found that many people had normal (and sometimes \r\nfaster than average) pulse rates when they woke up in the morning, and \r\nwhen they got hungry. Salt, which helps to maintain blood sugar, also \r\ntends to lower adrenalin, and hypothyroid people often lose salt too \r\neasily in their urine and sweat. Measuring the pulse rate before and \r\nafter breakfast, and in the afternoon, can give a good impression of \r\nthe variations in adrenalin. (The blood pressure, too, will show the \r\neffects of adrenaline in hypothyroid people. Hypothyroidism is a major \r\ncause of hypertension.) But \r\nhypoglycemia also tends to decrease the conversion of T4 to T3, so heat \r\nproduction often decreases when a person is hungry. First, their fingers, \r\ntoes, and nose will get cold, because adrenalin, or adrenergic sympathetic \r\nnervous activity, will increase to keep the brain and heart at a normal \r\ntemperature, by reducing circulation to the skin and extremities. Despite \r\nthe temperature-regulating effect of adrenalin, the reduced heat production \r\nresulting from decreased T3 will make a person susceptible to hypothermia \r\nif the environment is cool. Since \r\nfood, especially carbohydrate and protein, will increase blood sugar \r\nand T3 production, eating is thermogenic, and the oral (or eardrum) \r\ntemperature is likely to rise after eating. Blood \r\nsugar falls at night, and the body relies on the glucose stored in the \r\nliver as glycogen for energy, and hypothyroid people store very little \r\nsugar. As a result, adrenalin and cortisol begin to rise almost as soon \r\nas a person goes to bed, and in hypothyroid people, they rise very high, \r\nwith the adrenalin usually peaking around 1 or 2 A.M., and the cortisol \r\npeaking around dawn; the high cortisol raises blood sugar as morning \r\napproaches, and allows adrenalin to decline. Some people wake up during \r\nthe adrenalin peak with a pounding heart, and have trouble getting back \r\nto sleep unless they eat something. If \r\nthe night-time stress is very high, the adrenalin will still be high \r\nuntil breakfast, increasing both temperature and pulse rate. The cortisol \r\nstimulates the breakdown of muscle tissue and its conversion to energy, \r\nso it is thermogenic, for some of the same reasons that food is thermogenic. After \r\neating breakfast, the cortisol (and adrenalin, if it stayed high despite \r\nthe increased cortisol) will start returning to a more normal, lower \r\nlevel, as the blood sugar is sustained by food, instead of by the stress \r\nhormones. In some hypothyroid people, this is a good time to measure \r\nthe temperature and pulse rate. In a normal person, both temperature \r\nand pulse rate rise after breakfast, but in very hypothyroid people \r\neither, or both, might fall. Some \r\nhypothyroid people have a very slow pulse, apparently because they aren't \r\ncompensating with a large production of adrenalin. When they eat, the \r\nliver's increased production of T3 is likely to increase both their \r\ntemperature and their pulse rate. By \r\nwatching the temperature and pulse rate at different times of day, especially \r\nbefore and after meals, it's possible to separate some of the effects \r\nof stress from the thyroid-dependent, relatively basal metabolic \r\nrate. When beginning to take a thyroid supplement, it's important to \r\nkeep a chart of these measurements for at least two weeks, since that's \r\nroughly the half-life of thyroxine in the body. When the body has accumulated \r\na steady level of the hormones, and begun to function more fully, the \r\nfactors such as adrenaline that have been chronically distorted to compensate \r\nfor hypothyroidism will have begun to normalize, and the early effects \r\nof the supplementary thyroid will in many cases seem to disappear, with \r\nheart rate and temperature declining. The daily dose of thyroid often \r\nhas to be increased several times, as the state of stress and the adrenaline \r\nand cortisol production decrease. Counting \r\ncalories achieves approximately the same thing as measuring oxygen consumption, \r\nand is something that will allow people to evaluate the various thyroid \r\ntests they may be given by their doctor. Although food intake and metabolic \r\nrate vary from day to day, an approximate calorie count for several \r\ndays can often make it clear that a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is \r\nmistaken. If a person is eating only about 1800 calories per day, and \r\nhas a steady and normal body weight, any hyperthyroidism is strictly \r\nmetaphysical, or as they say, clinical. When \r\nthe humidity and temperature are normal, a person evaporates about a \r\nliter of water for every 1000 calories metabolized. Eating 2000 calories \r\nper day, a normal person will take in about four liters of liquid, and \r\nform about two liters of urine. A hyperthyroid person will invisibly \r\nlose several quarts of water in a day, and a hypothyroid person may \r\nevaporate a quart or less. When \r\ncells, because of a low metabolic rate, don't easily return to their \r\nthoroughly energized state after they have been stimulated, they tend \r\nto take up water, or, in the case of blood vessels, to become excessively \r\npermeable. Fatigued muscles swell noticeably, and chronically fatigued \r\nnerves can swell enough to cause them to be compressed by the surrounding \r\nconnective tissues. The energy and hydration state of cells can be detected \r\nin various ways, including magnetic resonance, and electrical impedance, \r\nbut functional tests are easy and practical. With \r\nsuitable measuring instruments, the effects of hypothyroidism can be \r\nseen as slowed conduction along nerves, and slowed recovery and readiness \r\nfor new responses. Slow reaction time is associated with slowed memory, \r\nperception, and other mental processes. Some of these nervous deficits \r\ncan be remedied slightly just by raising the core temperature and providing \r\nsuitable nutrients, but the active thyroid hormone, T3 is mainly responsible \r\nfor maintaining the temperature, the nutrients, and the intracellular \r\nrespiratory energy production. In \r\nnerves, as in other cells, the ability to rest and repair themselves \r\nincreases with the proper level of thyroid hormone. In some cells, the \r\nenergized stability produced by the thyroid hormones prevents inflammation \r\nor an immunological hyperactivity. In the 1950s, shortly after it was \r\nidentified as a distinct substance, T3 was found to be anti-inflammatory, \r\nand both T4 and T3 have a variety of anti-inflammatory actions, besides \r\nthe suppression of the pro-inflammatory TSH. Because \r\nthe actions of T3 can be inhibited by many factors, including polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids, reverse T3, and excess thyroxine, the absolute level of \r\nT3 can't be used by itself for diagnosis. Free T3 or free T4 \r\nis a laboratory concept, and the biological activity of T3 doesn't necessarily \r\ncorrespond to its freedom in the test. T3 bound to its transport \r\nproteins can be demonstrated to enter cells, mitochondria, and nuclei. \r\nTransthyretin, which carries both vitamin A and thyroid hormones, is \r\nsharply decreased by stress, and should probably be regularly measured \r\nas part of the thyroid examination. When \r\nT3 is metabolically active, lactic acid won't be produced unnecessarily, \r\nso the measurement of lactate in the blood is a useful test for interpreting \r\nthyroid function. Cholesterol is used rapidly under the influence of \r\nT3, and ever since the 1930s it has been clear that serum cholesterol \r\nrises in hypothyroidism, and is very useful diagnostically. Sodium, \r\nmagnesium, calcium, potassium, creatinine, albumin, glucose, and other \r\ncomponents of the serum are regulated by the thyroid hormones, and can \r\nbe used along with the various functional tests for evaluating thyroid \r\nfunction. Stereotypes \r\nare important. When a very thin person with high blood pressure visits \r\na doctor, hypothyroidism isn't likely to be considered; even high TSH \r\nand very low T4 and T3 are likely to be ignored, because of the stereotypes. \r\n(And if those tests were in the healthy range, the person would be at \r\nrisk for the hyperthyroid diagnosis.) But remembering some of \r\nthe common adaptive reactions to a thyroid deficiency, the catabolic \r\neffects of high cortisol and the circulatory disturbance caused by high \r\nadrenaline should lead to doing some of the appropriate tests, instead \r\nof treating the person's hypertension and under nourished condition.

Servicio \r\nde Neurologia, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Espana.Sinue@arrakis.esAIMS: Although it is commonly recognised that diseases \r\nof the thyroids can simulate extrapyramidal disorders, a review of the \r\ncauses of Parkinsonism in the neurology literature shows that they are \r\nnot usually mentioned or, if so, only very briefly. The development \r\nof hypothyroidism in a patient with Parkinson s disease can go undetected, \r\nsince the course of both diseases can involve similar clinical features. \r\nGenerally speaking there is always an insistence on the need to conduct \r\na thyroidal hormone study in any patient with symptoms of Parkinson, \r\nbut no emphasis is put on the need to continue to rule out dysthyroidism \r\nthroughout the natural course of the disease, in spite of the fact that \r\nthe concurrence of both pathological conditions can be high and that, \r\nin the same way hypothyroidism can simulate Parkinson s disease, the \r\nlatter can also conceal hypothyroidism. CASE REPORT: We report the case \r\nof a female patient who had been suffering from Parkinson s disease \r\nfor 17 years and started to present on off fluctuations that did not \r\nrespond to therapy. Hypothyroidism was observed and the hormone replacement \r\ntherapy used to resolve the problem allowed the Parkinsonian fluctuations \r\nto be controlled. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that it is very wise to suspect \r\nhypothyroidism in patients known to be suffering from Parkinson s disease, \r\nand especially so in cases where the clinical condition worsens and \r\nsymptoms no longer respond properly to antiparkinsonian treatment. These \r\nobservations stress the possible role played by thyroid hormones in \r\ndopaminergic metabolism and vice versa. animals from the same line. (Lancet. \r\n1975 Nov 1;2(7940):845-8..

        "chunk_html": "Water: swelling, tension, pain, fatigue, agingI \r\nhave spoken to many people who believe they should drink \"8 glasses \r\nof water every day,\" in addition to their normal foods, even if \r\nthey don't feel thirsty. Many doctors still recite this dangerous slogan, \r\nbut the addition of the qualifying phrase, \"or other liquids,\" \r\n\r\nhas become common. The \r\namount of water a person needs is extremely variable, depending on things \r\nsuch as metabolic rate, activity, and the temperature and humidity of \r\nthe air. Working hard in hot, dry weather, it's possible to drink more \r\nthan two quarts per hour for more than eight hours, without forming \r\nany urine, because all of the water is lost by evaporation. But in very \r\nhot, humid weather, a person with a low metabolic rate can be endangered \r\nby the smallest amount of water (e.g., \"Meteorological relations \r\nof eclampsia in Lagos, Nigeria,\" Agobe, et al., 1981). Most \r\nfoods contain a considerable amount of water, usually more than 70% \r\nof their weight, and some water is produced in cells by metabolism. \r\nThe function of water in the organism has been mystified and neglected \r\nbecause of some deeply rooted cultural images of the nature of organisms \r\nand their cellular make-up. One \r\nsilly image that has been perpetuated by schools and textbooks is that \r\nbiochemistry consists of chemical reactions that occur in substances \r\ndissolved in water, and that the water is retained by cells because \r\nthey are enclosed by an oily membrane, and because of the osmotic forces \r\nproduced by the dissolved substances. Most grade school kids have seen \r\nan osmometer made from an egg, in which the egg causes a column of water \r\nto rise, and have heard the explanation that this has something to do \r\nwith the way cells work. Membrane pumps are invoked to explain the differences \r\nin solute concentrations and \"osmotic pressure\" inside and \r\noutside cells. The story is that invisible things on the surface of \r\na cell (in its \"membrane\") force dissolved molecules to move \r\nin ways that they wouldn't move spontaneously by diffusion, and that \r\nwater passively follows the \"actively transported\" solutes. \r\nBut the evidence shows that both water and its solutes are regulated \r\nby the bulk phase of the cell, not its surface. In \r\nsome cultural settings, animism has a kind of charm (water sprites, \r\nand such), but in the culture of medicine and biology, the animistic \r\nconceptualization of cells and their mechanisms has been very destructive, \r\nbecause it gets in the way of coherent understanding of physiology. \r\nPractically every disease would be approached differently if the physiology \r\nof water and ions were allowed to advance beyond the animistic doctrines \r\nof mainstream medicine, such as the \"membrane pumps.\" If all \r\nthe substances that are said to be \"actively transported\" \r\nby pumps into, or out of, cells are considered, the amount of energy \r\nrequired to operate the pumps is at least 15 times larger than the total \r\nenergy available to cells. \"Specific\" pumps are commonly invoked \r\neven for novel synthetic chemicals, to explain their unequal distribution, \r\ninside and outside cells. In many biological situations water is ignored, \r\nbut when it becomes an issue, its distribution is usually mechanistically \r\nsubordinated to the solutes that are actively \"pumped.\" Cells \r\naren't osmometers, in the sense the textbooks say. They do control their \r\nwater content, but no \"membrane pumps\" are needed. It's more \r\naccurate to think of the water of cells as being \"dissolved in \r\ncells,\" somewhat the way water is contained in jello or boiled \r\neggs.  The cell controls its hydration by the processes that control \r\nits structure, its metabolism, and movements, because water is part \r\nof its deepest structures and essential functions. The cell's adjustments \r\nto changes of hydration and volume appear to be regulated by contractile \r\nproteins and energy metabolism (Minkoff and Damadian, 1976). Any \r\nstress or energy deficit that disturbs cellular structure or function \r\ndisturbs the interactions among water, proteins, and other components \r\nof the cell. Excitation causes a cell to take up extra water, not by \r\nosmosis resulting from an increase in the concentration of solutes in \r\nthe cell, or because the membrane has become porous, but because the \r\nstructural proteins of the cell have momentarily increased their affinity \r\nfor water. This \r\nincreased affinity is similar to the process that causes a gel to swell \r\nin the presence of alkalinity, and it is related to the process called \r\nelectroosmosis, in which water moves toward a higher negative charge. \r\nIntense excitation or stress increases the cell's electrically negative \r\ncharges, and causes it to become more alkaline and to swell. Swelling \r\nand alkalinity cause the cell to begin the synthesis of DNA, in preparation \r\nfor cell division. Mitogens and carcinogens, including estrogen, cause \r\ncells to become alkaline and to swell, and substances that block the \r\ncell's alkalinization (such as the diuretics acetazolamide and amiloride) \r\ninhibit cell division. Prolonged alkaline stress alone can cause malignant \r\ntransformation of kidney cells (Oberleithner, et al., 1991). The \r\ngeneral idea of \"stress\" is useful, because it includes processes \r\nsuch as fatigue, osmotic pressure changes, disturbed pH, and the enzyme \r\nchanges that follow, producing substances such as lactic acid, nitric \r\noxide, polyamines, estrogen, serotonin, and many more specific mediators. \r\nBut paying attention to the physical factors involved in a stress reaction \r\nis important, if we are to see the organism integrally, rather than \r\nas a collection of \"specific biological mechanisms,\" involving \r\nthings like the pixie-powered \"membrane pumps.\" When \r\na cell shrinks under hyperosmolar conditions, its metabolism becomes \r\ncatabolic, breaking down proteins and glycogen, and sometimes producing \r\nlactic acid, which results in an alkaline shift, increasing the cell's \r\naffinity for water, and causing it to return to normal size. A slight \r\ndegree of hyperosmolarity increases the cell's metabolic rate. Swelling \r\nin hypo-osmolar conditions, i.e,, with an excess of water, is anabolic, \r\nleading to cellular proliferation, and inhibiting the breakdown of protein \r\nand glycogen. Respiring \r\ncells are always producing some water, by transferring hydrogen from \r\nfuel molecules to oxygen. Respiration also produces carbon dioxide, \r\nwhich in itself is a Lewis acid (meaning that it binds electrons, rather \r\nthan releasing protons), that associates with cellular proteins, acidifying \r\nthem in the process. A large amount of carbon dioxide can exist inside \r\ncells in the bound form. Acidified cytoplasm (like any other mostly \r\nacidic polymer-gel) releases water and sodium. (This process is physically \r\nanalogous to the process of flushing a water softener with salt, or \r\na demineralizer with acid, to reactivate it.) Besides \r\nbinding with the cytoplasm, the carbon dioxide can be changed into carbonic \r\nacid, by chemically combining with water. Carbonic acid is hydrophilic, \r\nand so it quickly leaves the cell, taking with it some of the oppositely \r\ncharged ions, such as calcium and sodium. The formation of carbonic \r\nacid, which is constantly streaming out of the respiring cell, causes \r\nsome water and some positively ionized metals to leave the cell, in \r\nan \"active\" process, that doesn't require any mysterious pumps. As \r\nthe blood passes through the lungs, carbon dioxide leaves the system, \r\nand as carbonic acid is converted to carbon dioxide, water is left behind \r\nin the blood, along with the counterions (of alkaline metals or earths), \r\naccounting for slight differences in pH and osmolarity between the bloodstream \r\nand the tissue cells. Some experiments suggest that the normal osmolarity \r\nof various tissues is 2 or 3 times higher than that of the blood, which \r\nis called \"isosmolar\" or isotonic. The \r\nkidneys adjust the osmolarity of the blood by allowing water and solutes \r\nto leave the bloodstream, in proportions that usually keep the body \r\nfluids in balance with cells. The kidneys are able to compensate for \r\nmany of the imbalances produced by stress and inappropriate diets, for \r\nexample by forming ammonia and carbon dioxide, to compensate for imbalances \r\nin the alkalis and acids that are being delivered to the blood by other \r\norgans. Because of the kidneys' great ability to regulate the flow of \r\nsolutes between the blood and the forming urine, the \"membrane \r\npumps\" have great importance for medical nephrologists. But the \r\nmore extreme the \"active transport\" is, the more obvious it \r\nbecomes that processes other than \"membrane pumps\" are responsible. Some \r\nlizards and sea birds have glands near their noses that are called salt \r\nglands, because of their ability to secrete salt. The salt gland is \r\nprobably the most extreme case of active transport, but its physiology \r\nis very similar to the physiology of any other secretory gland or membrane, \r\nsuch as tear glands and sweat glands. The mechanism of salt excretion \r\nin these glands should really settle the issue of how active transport \r\nworks, but most nephrologists, oculists, and medical researchers in \r\ngeneral aren't interested in salt glands. Carbon \r\ndioxide is the driving force in the salt gland. The constant formation \r\nof CO2, and its loss into the air, allows a high concentration of salt \r\nto be excreted. Blocking the interchange of CO2 and carbonic acid, with \r\nacetazolamide, or inhibiting the formation of CO2, prevents the excretion \r\nof salt. Since \r\nrespiratory metabolism, governed by the thyroid hormone, is our main \r\nsource of carbon dioxide, it's obvious that thyroid deficiency should \r\nimpair our ability to regulate water and solutes, such as salt.  \r\nAn organism that illustrates this function of thyroid is the young salmon, \r\nwhen it leaves a freshwater river to begin its life in the ocean. As \r\nit converts its physiology to tolerate the salty environment, its thyroid \r\nhormone surges. When it's mature, and returns to the fresh water to \r\nspawn, its prolactin rises sharply. In experiments with rodents, it \r\nhas been found that drinking a large amount of water increases their \r\nprolactin, but the same amount of water, with added salt, doesn't. Hypothyroidism \r\nis typically associated with increased prolactin secretion. Hypothyroid \r\npeople typically retain water, while losing salt, so the hypothyroid \r\nstate is analogous to the salmon that has returned to the river, and \r\nto the mice that drink too much salt-free water. The \r\ntypical hypothyroid person loses salt rapidly in the urine (and probably \r\nin the sweat, too, though that is usually diagnosed as cystic fibrosis), \r\nand retains water, diluting the urine less than normal. The reduced \r\nproduction of carbon dioxide, with increased susceptibility to producing \r\nlactate and ammonium, causes the cells to be more alkaline than normal, \r\nincreasing their affinity for water. The rise of estrogen that usually \r\naccompanies hypothyroidism also increases intracellular pH, loss of \r\nsodium, and over-hydration of the blood. Hypothyroid \r\nmuscles typically retain excess water, and fatigue easily, taking up \r\nmore water than normal during exertion. In childhood, mild hypothyroidism \r\noften causes the leg muscles to swell and ache in the evenings, with \r\nwhat have been called \"growing pains.\" When the problem is \r\nmore extreme, all the skeletal muscles can become very large (Hoffman \r\nsyndrome), because of the anabolic effect of over-hydration. Enlargement \r\nof any muscle can result from the excessive hydration produced by thyroid \r\ndeficiency, but when it happens to the muscles behind the eyes (Itabashi, \r\net al., 1988), it often leads to a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, rather \r\nthan hypothyroidism. The \r\nlittle kids with the Hoffman syndrome don't have the bloated myxedematous \r\nappearance that's often associated with hypothyroidism. They look athletic \r\nto a ridiculous degree, like miniature body-builders. But after a few \r\nweeks of treatment with thyroid, they regain the slender appearance \r\nthat's normal for their age. The swollen state actually supports enlargement \r\nof the muscle, and the cellular processes are probably closely related \r\nto the muscle swelling and growth produced by exercise. The growth of \r\nthe muscle cell during swelling seems to be the result of normal repair \r\nprocesses, in a context of reduced turnover of cellular proteins. The \r\npeople who believe in membrane pumps that maintain normal solute distributions \r\nby active transport know that the pumps would require energy (far more \r\nthan the cell can produce, but they don't confront that issue), and \r\nso their view requires that they assign a great part of the cell's resources \r\njust to maintaining ionic homeostasis, and the result of that is that \r\nthey tend to neglect the actual energy economy of the cell, which is \r\nprimarily devoted to the adaptive renewal of the cell structure and \r\nenzyme systems, not to driving the systems that don't exist. The \r\n\"anabolic\" balance of the swollen cell is the result of decreased \r\nturnover of the cell's components. The higher rate of metabolism produced \r\nby adequate thyroid function maintains a high rate of renewal of the \r\ncell's systems, keeping the cell constantly adjusted to slight changes \r\nin the organism's needs. The evidence of a high rate of bone turnover \r\nis sometimes taken as evidence that thyroid can cause osteoporosis. Later, \r\nin a more mature person, chronically fatigued and painful muscles that \r\nat one time would have been diagnosed as rheumatism, may be diagnosed \r\nas fibromyalgia. Most doctors are reluctant to prescribe thyroid supplements \r\nfor the problem, but the association of elevated prolactin with the \r\nmuscle disorder is now generally recognized. The \r\nhypo-osmolar blood of hypothyroidism, increasing the excitability of \r\nvascular endothelium and smooth muscle, is probably a mechanism contributing \r\nto the high blood pressure of hypothyroidism. The swelling produced \r\nin vascular endothelium by hypo-osmotic plasma causes these cells to \r\ntake up fats, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. The \r\ngeneralized leakiness affects all cells (see \"Leakiness\" newsletter), \r\nand can contribute to reduced blood volume, and problems such as orthostatic \r\nhypotension. The swollen endothelium is stickier, and this is suspected \r\nto support the metastasis of cancer cells. Inflammation-related proteins, \r\nincluding CRP, are increased by the hypothyroid hyperhydration. The \r\nheart muscle itself can swell, leading to congestive heart failure. Some \r\nof the nerve problems associated with hypothyroidism (e.g., carpal tunnel \r\nsyndrome and \"foot drop\") are blamed on compression of the \r\nnerves, from swelling of surrounding tissues, but the evidence is clear \r\nthat hypothyroidism causes swelling in the nerve cells themselves. For \r\nexample, in hypothyroidism, nerves are slow to respond to stimulation, \r\nand their conduction of the impulse is slow. These changes are the same \r\nas those produced by hyper-hydration caused by other means. Hypothyroid \r\nnerves are easily fatigued, and fatigued nerves take up a large amount \r\nof water. Swelling of the spinal cord is probably responsible for the \r\n\"spinal stenosis\" commonly seen in domestic animals and people; \r\nthe mobility of intracellular water molecules is distinctly increased \r\nin patients with compression of the spinal cord (Tsuchiya, et al., 2003; \r\nRies, et al., 2001). The \r\nhyperhydration of hypothyroidism has been known to cause swelling and \r\nsoftening of cartilage, with deformation of joints, but somehow it has \r\nnever dawned on surgeons that this process would lead to deformation \r\nof intervertebral disks. It \r\nhas been known for a long time that hyperhydration can produce seizures;at one time, neurologists would test for epilepsy by having the patient \r\ndrink a pint of water. Although there are many reasons to think that \r\nthe hyperhydration produced by hypothyroidism is a factor in epilepsy, \r\nphysicians have been very reluctant to consider the possibility, because \r\nthey generally think of thyroid hormone as a stimulant, and believe \r\nthat \"stimulants\" are necessarily inappropriate for people \r\nwith epilepsy. While \r\nit's true that the thyroid hormone increases sensitivity to adrenaline, \r\nits most noticeable effect is in improving the ability to relax, including \r\nthe ability to sleep soundly and restfully. And it happens that increasing \r\nnorepinephrine (the brain's locally produced form of adrenaline) helps \r\nto prevent seizures (Giorgi, et al., 2004). Cell \r\nswelling increases the sensitivity of nerves, and hyperosmotic shrinkage \r\nlowers their sensitivity. Increasing carbon dioxide helps to reduce \r\nthe hydration of tissue (for example, the hydration and thickness of \r\nthe cornea are decreased when carbon dioxide is increased), and increasing \r\ncarbon dioxide is known to inhibit epileptic seizures. Another diagnostic \r\ntrick of neurologists was to have the patient hyperventilate; it would \r\noften bring on a seizure. The diuretic acetazolamide, which increases \r\nthe body's carbon dioxide and reduces water retention, is very effective \r\nfor preventing seizures. The \r\nsleep-inducing effect of salty food is probably related to the anti-excitatory \r\neffects of hyperosmolarity, of adequate thyroid function, and of carbon \r\ndioxide. Degenerative \r\ndiseases, especially cancer, heart disease, and brain diseases, are \r\nless prevalent in populations that live at a high altitude. When oxygen \r\npressure is low, the lungs lose carbon dioxide more slowly, and so the \r\namount of carbon dioxide retained in the body is greater. If the basic \r\nproblem in hypothyroidism is the deficient production of carbon dioxide \r\ncausing excessive loss of salt and retention of water, resulting in \r\nhypo-osmotic body fluids, then we would expect people at high altitude \r\nto have better retention of salt, more loss of water, and more hypertonic \r\nbody fluids. That has been observed in many studies. The increased rate \r\nof metabolism at altitude would be consistent with the relatively active \r\n\"catabolism\" of the slightly hyperosmotic condition. After \r\nthe drug companies began, in the late 1950s, marketing some newly discovered \r\n(thiazide) diuretics, which cause sodium to be lost in the urine, their \r\nadvertising campaigns created a cultish belief that salt caused hypertension. \r\nThey convinced a whole generation of physicians that pregnant women \r\nshould limit salt in their diet, take a diuretic preventively, and restrict \r\ncalories to prevent \"excessive\" weight gain. Millions of women \r\nand their babies were harmed by that cult. Pre-eclampsia \r\nand pregnancy toxemia have been corrected (Shanklin and Hodin, 1979) \r\nby both increased dietary protein and increased salt, which improve \r\ncirculation, lower blood pressure, and prevent seizures, while reducing \r\nvascular leakiness. The effectiveness of increased salt in pre-eclampsia \r\nled me to suggest it for women with premenstrual edema, because both \r\nconditions typically involve high estrogen, hyponatremia, and a tendency \r\ntoward hypo-osmolarity. Estrogen itself causes sodium loss, reduced \r\nosmolarity, and increased capillary leakiness. Combined with a high \r\nprotein diet, eating a little extra salt usually helps to correct a \r\nvariety of problems involving edema, poor circulation, and high blood \r\npressure. The \r\ndanger of salt restriction in pregnancy has hardly been recognized by \r\nmost physicians, and its danger in analogous physiological situations \r\nis much farther from their consideration. One \r\nof the things that happen when there isn't enough sodium in the diet \r\nis that more aldosterone is synthesized. Aldosterone causes less sodium \r\nto be lost in the urine and sweat, but it achieves that at the expense \r\nof the increased loss of potassium, magnesium, and probably calcium. \r\nThe loss of potassium leads to vasoconstriction, which contributes to \r\nheart and kidney failure and high blood pressure. The loss of magnesium \r\ncontributes to vasoconstriction, inflammation, and bone loss. Magnesium \r\ndeficiency is extremely common, but a little extra salt in the diet \r\nmakes it easier to retain the magnesium in our foods. Darkness \r\nand hypothyroidism both reduce the activity of cytochrome oxidase, making \r\ncells more susceptible to stress. A promoter of excitotoxicity, ouabain, \r\nor a lack of salt, can function as the equivalent of darkness, in resetting \r\nthe biological rhythms (Zatz, 1989, 1991). Bone \r\nloss occurs almost entirely during the night, and the nocturnal rise \r\nin cortisol and prolactin has strongly catabolic effects, but many other \r\npro-inflammatory substances also rise during the night, and are probably \r\nthe basic cause of the increased catabolism. Increased salt in the diet \r\nappears to improve some aspects of calcium metabolism, such as reducing \r\nparathyroid hormone and increasing ionized calcium, when the diet is \r\ndeficient in calcium (Tordoff, 1997). The \r\nkidneys can produce large amounts of carbon dioxide and ammonia, in \r\nthe process of preventing the loss of electrolytes, while allowing acid \r\nto be lost in the urine. The ammonia is produced by the breakdown of \r\nprotein. During stress or fasting, the loss of tissue protein can be \r\nminimized by supplementing the minerals, potassium, sodium, magnesium, \r\nand calcium. Salt restriction can cause aldosterone to increase, and \r\nexcess aldosterone causes potassium loss, and increases the use of protein \r\nto form ammonia (Norby, et al., 1976; Snart and Taylor, 1978; Welbourne \r\nand Francoeur, 1977). Aldosterone \r\nsecretion increases during the night, and its rise is greater in depressed \r\nand stressed people. It inhibits energy metabolism, increases insulin \r\nresistance, and increases the formation of proinflammatory substances \r\nin fat cells (Kraus, et al., 2005).  During aging, salt restriction \r\ncan produce an exaggerated nocturnal rise in aldosterone. During \r\nthe night, there are many changes that suggest that the thyroid functions \r\nare being blocked, for example a surge in the thyroid stimulating hormone, \r\nwith T4 and T3 being lowest between 11 PM and 3 AM (Lucke, et al., 1977), \r\nwhile temperature and energy production are at their lowest. This suggests \r\nthat the problems of hypothyroidism will be most noticeable during the \r\nnight. Rheumatoid \r\narthritis and asthma are two inflammatory conditions that are notoriously \r\nworse during the night. Melatonin has been reported to be higher in \r\npatients with severe asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, and to promote \r\nthe secretion of a variety of other pro-inflammatory substances. The \r\npeak of melatonin secretion is followed by the peak of aldosterone, \r\nand a little later by the peak of cortisol. The \r\nuse of bright light (which suppresses melatonin) to treat depression \r\nprobably helps to inhibit the production of aldosterone, which is strongly \r\nassociated with depression. Both \r\naldosterone and melatonin can contribute to the contraction of smooth \r\nmuscle in blood vessels. Constriction of blood vessels in the kidneys \r\nhelps to conserve water, which is adaptive if blood volume has been \r\nreduced because of a sodium deficiency. When blood vessels are inappropriately \r\nconstricted, the blood pressure rises, while organs don't receive as \r\nmuch blood circulation as they need. This impaired circulation seems \r\nto be what causes the kidney damage associated with high blood pressure, \r\nwhich can eventually lead to heart failure and multiple organ failure. Progesterone, \r\nwhich helps to maintain blood volume (partly by preventing vascular \r\nleakiness, preventing excessive sodium loss and by supporting albumin \r\nsynthesis) antagonizes aldosterone. Aldosterone antagonists are now \r\nbeing recognized as effective treatments for hypertension, water retention, \r\ncongestive heart failure, arrhythmia, diabetes, kidney disease, and \r\na great variety of inflammatory problems. (Synthetic drugs to antagonize \r\naldosterone are most effective when they are most like natural progesterone.) \r\nSince aldosterone contributes to fibrosis of the heart and kidneys (nephrosclerosis), \r\nprogesterone, the \"antifibromatogenic steroid,\" should be \r\nhelpful for those problems that have been considered irreversible. Aldosterone \r\nappears to contribute to the hyperglycemia of diabetes itself, and not \r\njust to its complications, by interfering with the interactions of insulin \r\nand cortisol (Yamashita, et al., 2004). One \r\nof progesterone's fundamental actions is to cause estrogen \"receptors\" \r\nto disintegrate; hypertonicity has this effect in some situations. Estrogen's \r\neffects are largely produced by increased tissue hydration. Aldosterone \r\ncauses cells to take up sodium, while increasing their pH, i.e., raising \r\ntheir alkalinity (Mihailidou and Funder, 2005). Intracellular sodium \r\nhas long been known to be a factor, along with swelling and alkalinity, \r\nin stimulating cell division (Cone and Tongier, 1971). A lack of salt \r\nstimulates the formation of serotonin, which in turn stimulates aldosterone \r\nsynthesis--that is, a sodium restricted diet activates processes that \r\ncause cells to take up sodium inappropriately, in a situation reminiscent \r\nof the calcium deficient diet causing inappropriate calcification. Aldosterone, \r\nlike stress or hypo-osmolarity, activates the enzyme (ODC) which produces \r\nthe polyamines, that promote cell division, and that can probably account \r\nfor some of the harmful effects of excessive aldosterone. Eating \r\nsalty food around bedtime usually has a sleep-inducing effect, and it \r\nhelps to maintain blood volume (which tends to decrease during the night), \r\nand to restrain the nocturnal rise of aldosterone, and other indicators \r\nof stress or inflammation. Eating gelatin, which lacks tryptophan, will \r\nreduce the formation of serotonin, and is likely to limit the formation \r\nof aldosterone. Pregnenolone \r\ncan sometimes very quickly allow swollen tissues to release their water. \r\nThis function is probably closely related to its antifibromatogenic \r\nfunction, since swelling and leaking set the stage for fibrosis. Hyperosmotic \r\nsodium chloride solutions (e.g., 7.5%) are being used more often for \r\ntreating trauma and shock, because the concentrated solution increases \r\nblood volume by removing water from the extravascular spaces, unlike \r\nthe \"isotonic\" saline (0.9% sodium chloride), which usually \r\nadds to the edema by leaking out of the blood vessels. A \r\n5% sodium chloride solution is effective for promoting healing of damaged \r\ncorneas, and solutions of 5% to 10% sodium chloride are effective for \r\naccelerating the healing of wounds and ulcers. Other hypertonic solutions, \r\nfor example glucose or urea, have been used therapeutically, but sodium \r\nchloride seems to be the most effective in a variety of situations. Thyroid \r\nhormone, by maintaining oxidative metabolism with the production of \r\ncarbon dioxide, is highly protective against excessive water retention \r\nand loss of sodium and magnesium. Sometimes \r\ndoctors recommend that constipated people should drink extra water, \r\n\"to soften the stool.\" The colon is where water is removed \r\nfrom the intestinal contents, and when it is inflamed, it removes too \r\nmuch water. Several decades ago, it was recognized (Orr, et al., 1931) \r\nthat hypertonic saline, given intravenously, would stimulate intestinal \r\nperistalsis, and could be used to treat paralytic ileus and intestinal \r\nobstruction. When \r\nwater is taken orally, it is absorbed high in the intestine, long before \r\nit reaches the colon, so the recommendation to drink water for constipation \r\ncan produce a situation that's the opposite of intravenous hypertonic \r\nsaline, by diluting the blood. Using a hypertonic salt solution as an \r\nenema can have the same beneficial effect on the intestine as the intravenous \r\ntreatment. Constipation \r\nphysiology is probably analogous to the physiology of congestive heart \r\nfailure, in which muscles are weakened and fatigued by swelling. In \r\nrecent decades, the prevalence of congestive heart failure has increased \r\ntremendously, so that it is now often called an epidemic. Hyponatremia \r\n(too little salt, or too much water) is a recognized \"risk factor\" \r\nfor congestive heart failure. In the failing heart, the muscle cells \r\nare swollen, causing the heart wall to stiffen, weakening its ability \r\nto pump. Osmotically shrinking the cells can restore their function. The \r\nswollen heart, like any muscle, loses the ability to quickly and completely \r\nrelax, and so it doesn't fill adequately between contractions. Elastic \r\ntissues, such as arteries and lungs, stiffen when they are over-hydrated, \r\nlosing their normal functions. In small blood vessels, swelling narrows \r\nthe channel, increasing resistance to the flow of blood. When \r\npeople force themselves to drink a certain amount of water every day, \r\neven when they don't feel thirsty, they are activating complex adaptive \r\nprocesses unnecessarily. Thirst is the best guide to the amount of fluid \r\nneeded. When \r\nextra water consumption is combined with a low salt diet--as physicians \r\nhave so often recommended--a healthy person can adapt easily, but for \r\na hypothyroid person it can have disastrous effects.

The symptoms the Burrs saw are easily produced by \r\ndeficiencies of the vitamins and minerals that they didn't know about.What \r\nreally happens to animals when the \"essential fatty acids\" \r\nare lacking, in an otherwise adequate diet?Their \r\nmetabolic rate is very high.Their \r\nnutritional needs are increased.They \r\nare very resistant to many of the common causes of sickness and death.They \r\nare resistant to the biochemical and cellular changes seen in aging, \r\ndementia, autoimmunity, and the main types of inflammation.The \r\namount of polyunsaturated fatty acids often said to be essential (Holman, \r\n1981) is approximately the amount required to significantly increase \r\nthe incidence of cancer, and  very careful food selection is needed \r\nfor a diet that provides a lower amount.When \r\nI was studying the age pigment, lipofuscin, and its formation from polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids, I saw the 1927 study in which a fat free diet practically \r\neliminated the development of spontaneous cancers in rats (Bernstein \r\nand Elias). I have always wondered whether George and Mildred Burr were \r\naware of that study in 1929, when they published their claim that polyunsaturated \r\nfats are nutritionally essential. The German study was abstracted in \r\nBiological Abstracts, and the Burrs later cited several studies from \r\nGerman journals, and dismissively mentioned two U.S. studies* that claimed \r\nanimals could live on fat-free diets, so their neglect of such an important \r\nclaim is hard to understand. (*Their bibliography cited, without further \r\ncomment, Osborne and Mendel, 1920, and Drummond and Coward, 1921.)Since \r\n1927, others have demonstrated that the polyunsaturated fats are essential \r\nfor the development of cancer (and some other degenerative diseases), \r\nbut the Burrs' failed to even mention the issue at any time during their \r\ncareers. How could they, studying fat-free diets, have missed an important \r\ncontemporary publication, if I, 40 years later, saw it? There were very \r\nfew publications on dietary fats in those years, so it was hardly possible \r\nto miss it.When \r\nresearchers at the Clayton Foundation Biochemical Institute at the University \r\nof Texas demonstrated that \"Burr's disease\" was actually a \r\nvitamin B6 deficiency, rather than a fatty acid deficiency, the issue \r\nwas settled. Later studies failed to confirm the existence of the Burr \r\ndisease caused by a deficiency of fatty acids, though many similar conditions \r\nwere produced by a variety of other dietary defects. In 1938, a group \r\nin Burr's own laboratory (Brown, et al.) failed to produce dermatitis \r\nin a man during a six month experiment. Neither of the other major features \r\nof the Burr disease, male sterility and kidney degeneration, has been \r\nsubsequently confirmed. The claim that polyunsaturated fatty acid deficiency \r\ncaused sterility of male animals (\"A new and uniform cause of sterility \r\nis shown\") was quickly dropped, probably because anexcessof polyunsaturated fats was discovered to be an important cause of testicular \r\ndegeneration and sterility.One \r\nof the features of the Burrs' rats on the fat-free diet was that they \r\nate more calories and drank much more water than the rats that received \r\npolyunsaturated fatty acids in their diet. They believed that the animals \r\nwere unable to synthesize fat without linoleic acid, although in another \r\ncontext they cited a study in which the fat of rats on a fat-free diet \r\nwas similar in composition to lard:\"McAmis, Anderson, and \r\nMendel[37]fed rats a high sucrose, fat-free diet and rendered \r\nthe fat of the entire animal. This fat had an iodine number of 64 to \r\n71, a fairly normal value for lard.\"The \r\n\"wasteful\" food consumption, and the leanness of animals that \r\nweren't fed polyunsaturated fats became fairly common knowledge by the \r\nlate 1940s, but no one repeated the Burrs' claim that the absence of \r\nthose fatty acids led quickly to the animals' death. Meanwhile, \"crazy \r\nchick disease\" caused by feeding an excess of polyunsaturated fats, \r\nand a little later, \"yellow fat disease,\" caused by too much \r\nfish fat, were being recognized by farmers. In the 1950s, the seed oil \r\nindustry created the anti-cholesterol diet culture, and a few decades \r\nlater, without any new \"Burr-like\" publications, the omega \r\nminus 3 oils, especially fish oils, were coming to be represented as \r\nthe overlooked essential fatty acids, which were capable of preventing \r\nthe toxic effects of the original \"essential\" linoleic acid.Although \r\nthe 1929 Burr paper is still often cited as proof of the essentiality \r\nof PUFA, Burr's younger colleague (at the University of Minnesota Hormel \r\nInstitute), Ralph Holman, has cited an infant (1970), and a 78 year \r\nold woman (in 1969), who developed dermatitis while receiving fat-free \r\nintravenous feedings. Dermatitis, with dandruff, similar to Burr's disease, \r\nhas been produced by various nutritional deficiencies besides vitamin \r\nB6, including a trace mineral deficiency and a biotin deficiency, so \r\nthere is no valid reason to associate dermatitis with a fat deficiency. \r\nThe cases of \"EFA deficiency\" produced by intravenous feedings \r\nthat have been widely cited were probably the result of a deficiency \r\nof zinc or other trace mineral, since so-called \"Total Parenteral \r\nNutrition\" was in use for many years before the trace minerals \r\nwere added to the \"total\" formula. In 1975, I learned that \r\nour local hospital was putting all premature babies on what they called \r\ntotal intravenous feeding, without trace minerals, for weeks, or months. \r\nThere is still more emphasis on polyunsaturated fat in intravenous feeding \r\nthan on the essential trace nutrients.Holman \r\nand the Hormel Institute have been extremely influential in promoting \r\nthe doctrine of the essentiality of PUFA, including fish oils and the \r\nomega -3 oils, but their best evidence, the Burr experiment, doesn't \r\nmake their case. Far worse than that is the effect it has had in distracting \r\nattention from the profoundly toxic effects of the so-called essential \r\nfatty acids. Long after he should have known better, Holman was arguing \r\nthat butter was a nutritionally inferior fat.When \r\nthe Burrs were doing their study, Raymond Pearl was one of the most \r\nfamous biologists in the country, and his \"rate of living\" \r\ntheory of aging was very widely known. According to that theory, an \r\norganism has an intrinsic potential to produce a certain total amount \r\nof energy during its lifetime, and if it metabolizes at a higher than \r\nnormal rate, its life span will be proportionately shorter than normal.There \r\nis general agreement that animals on a fat free diet have a very high \r\nmetabolic rate, but the people who believe the \"rate of living\" \r\ntheory will be inclined to see the increased rate of metabolism as something \r\nharmful in itself. It is clear that this is what the Burrs thought. \r\nThey didn't attempt to provide a diet that provided increased amounts \r\nof all vitamins and minerals, in proportion to the increased metabolic \r\nrate.Pearl \r\ndid an experiment, sprouting cantaloupe seeds in a dish with water. \r\nThe sprouts that grew rapidly died sooner than those that grew more \r\nslowly. They died as soon as the nutrients stored in the endosperm had \r\nbeen consumed. Naturally, when nutrients are depleted, growth and metabolism \r\nmust stop. If food and air and water are rationed, then slow metabolizers \r\nare going to live longer. But when nutritional needs are met, the organisms \r\nwith the highest metabolic rate generally are healthier and live longer. \r\nIn a study of nurses, those who habitually consumed the most calories \r\nlived longer than those who consumed the least. Even while Pearl was \r\npromoting his theory, other famous biologists, for example John Northrup \r\nin Jacques Loeb's lab at the Rockefeller Institute, were making observations \r\nthat contradicted the rate of living theory. For example, around 1916, \r\nNorthrup observed that fruit flies that metabolized at the highest rate \r\nlived the longest. Northrup was doing biology, Pearl was doing propaganda, \r\nfollowing Weismannism.The \r\nidea of extending life span by slowing metabolism and growth was a logical \r\nimplication of the \"rate of living\" theory of aging, and it's \r\nan idea that is still popular. Many people have supposed that eating \r\nless would slow metabolism. Caloric restriction does extend the life \r\nspan of many species, but it generally preserves the high metabolic \r\nrate of youth, so that at a given age the calorie-restricted animal \r\nhas a higher rate of oxygen consumption per gram of body weight than \r\nthe unrestricted eaters.Roy \r\nWalford, a gerontologist who wrote about extending the human life span \r\nto 120 years by caloric restriction, spent 30 years limiting his diet \r\nto about 1600 calories, with little animal protein, almost no saturated \r\nfat--fish once or twice per week, poultry or beef about once, and a \r\nfat free milkshake for breakfast--and after about 15 years, began developing \r\na degenerative brain disease, ALS, one of the nerve diseases involving \r\nlipid peroxidation and excitotoxicity. When he died from the disease, \r\nhe had lived a year longer than the normal life expectancy.V. \r\nStefannson, one of the early polar explorers, spent a winter living \r\nentirely on caribou meat, and felt that it had prevented the scurvy \r\nthat had killed so many of the other explorers, who had counted on fruit \r\nand vegetables to prevent it. But he believed that meat was a metabolic \r\nstimulant that made people age prematurely, as Pearl's rate of living \r\ntheory predicted. Stefannson said that Eskimo women were getting old \r\nin their twenties, and that at the age of 60 they looked as old as Europeans \r\ndid at 80. He was a well informed anthropologist, and his observations \r\nwere probably accurate. The Eskimos he observed ate large amounts of \r\nfish, and other unsaturated fats, and sometimes ate highly decayed fish. \r\nAn accelerated rate of aging would be expected from such a diet, because \r\nof the toxic lipid peroxides.Calorie-restricted \r\nanimals (on a diet of normal composition) have a lower degree of fat \r\nunsaturation in their mitochondria as they age, preserving the relatively \r\nmore saturated fats of youth.Birds' \r\nmitochondrial fats are much less polyunsaturated than those of mammals, \r\nand birds' metabolic rates are much higher, and they live much longer \r\nthan mammals of a similar size.With \r\naging, the highly peroxidizable fatty acids, arachidonic and docosahexaenoic \r\nacid, increase greatly in a variety of tissues, and lipid peroxidation \r\nincreases with aging. Peroxidation slows mitochondrial respiration, \r\nlowering the metabolic rate. Caloric restriction slows the accumulation \r\nof the highly unsaturated fatty acids in mitochondria, and reduces peroxidation.Over \r\nthe years, it has become evident that the polyunsaturated fats are not \r\nvery compatible with a high rate of metabolism, though they are necessary \r\nfor organisms that live at low temperatures and metabolize slowly, such \r\nas fish and vegetables. The saturated fats solidify at low temperature;beef fat is very stiff at refrigerator temperature, and in a fat fish, \r\nsuch stiffness would be lethal.Even \r\nsome hibernating rodents can stay alive with their body tissues close \r\nto the freezing point, and their stored fats have to be unsaturated. \r\nWhen their diet doesn't allow them to store enough polyunsaturated fat, \r\nthey fail to go into hibernation. This is probably a clue to some of \r\nthe general biological effects of the PUFA.A \r\nseries of studies about 20 years ago showed that the functions of the \r\nthyroid hormone are all inhibited by unsaturated fats, with the inhibition \r\nincreasing in proportion to the number of unsaturations (double bonds) \r\nin the fat molecule.When \r\nthe tissues are saturated with those antithyroid fats, metabolism slows, \r\nespecially when any stress, such as cold or hunger, increases the concentration \r\nof free fatty acids in the blood stream. Stress and hypothyroidism increase \r\nthe formation of serotonin, which is an important factor in producing \r\nthe torpor of hibernation, and lowering the body temperature. The polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids themselves directly contribute to the formation of serotonin, \r\nfor example by increasing the ability of tryptophan to enter the brain. \r\nIn a certain cold climate, the PUFA are essential for hibernation, but \r\nunder other conditions, the rodent would be able to continue gathering \r\nfood and eating, instead of hibernating.The \r\ndirect effects of the PUFA on the endocrine and nervous systems, as \r\nillustrated by the hibernating squirrel, interact with their effects \r\non intercellular communication (including the formation of prostaglandins \r\nand related substances), and the effects of their oxidative breakdown \r\nproducts, such as acrolein. But the people who claim that they are absolutely, \r\nrather than conditionally, essential, base their argument on the idea \r\nthat they are needed for the formation of prostaglandins and cell membranes. \r\nThe fact that cells can replicate in fat free conditions shows that \r\nthe argument from membranes is unfounded. The argument from prostaglandins \r\nis more complex, but has no firmer foundation.When \r\na dose of PUFA is administered to a lizard, which isn't a hibernator, \r\nthe lizard's body temperature is lowered by several degrees. There are \r\nprobably many ways in which the PUFA produce that effect, besides increasing \r\nserotonin and decreasing thyroid. The PUFA are increased by estrogen, \r\nand they increase estrogen, and have some directly estrogen-like effects. \r\nEstrogen itself tends to lower body temperature and shift metabolism \r\naway from oxidative energy production. Aging, like estrogen, increases \r\nthe body's content of the PUFA:Linoleic, linolenic, dihomo-gamma-linolenic, \r\ndocosahexaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids are increased by age, and \r\nthe longer chain acids increase more rapidly in women than in men (Bolton-Smith, \r\net al., 1997). (Women are apparently relatively protected by progesterone, \r\nwhich inhibits lipolysis and prostaglandin formation, and protects the \r\nbrain, thymus, and other tissues from lipid peroxidation and other effects \r\nof the PUFA.)Aging \r\ninvolves a decreasing metabolic rate, an increased tendency toward inflammation, \r\nand a decreased ability to synthesize proteins. Inflammation contributes \r\nto the decreasing ability to use oxygen, and the slowed renewal of proteins \r\ncombined with lower ability to produce energy impair the organism's \r\nability to control peroxidative damage and inflammation.The \r\nfragments of deteriorating PUFA combine with proteins and other cell \r\nmaterials, producing immunogenic substances. The so-called \"advanced \r\nglycation end products,\" that have been blamed on glucose excess, \r\nare mostly derived from the peroxidation of the \"essential fatty \r\nacids.\" The name, glycation, indicates the addition of sugar \r\ngroups to proteins, such as occurs in diabetes and old age, but when \r\ntested in a controlled experiment,lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids produces the protein damage about 23 times faster than the \r\nsimple sugars do(Fu, et al., 1996).Several \r\nautoimmune disease models in animals (involving the eye, kidney, and \r\npancreas) have been prevented by a deficiency of the EFA (Schreiner, \r\net al., 1989, Bazan, et al., 1990, Benhamou, et al., 1995).Besides \r\ncausing a general slowing of metabolism, aging and toxic PUFA have specific \r\nactions on the detoxifying system. The enzymes that help to detoxify \r\nPUFA and estrogen and serotonin are inhibited by both PUFA and estrogen. \r\nAll systems, including blood vessels and the intestine, are made leaky \r\nby estrogen and the PUFA and their products.A reduced ability to regulate the excitatory \r\namino acids, resulting from PUFA toxins, tends to produce excitotoxicity, \r\ndamaging nerves (Ou, et al., 2002).Although \r\nthe interplay of the various types of nerve is very complex, a variety \r\nof experiments suggest that the PUFA are acting directly on serotonergic \r\nnerves, rather than just increasing the conversion of tryptophan to \r\nserotonin.For \r\nexample, a deficiency of the so-called essential fatty acids, EFA, makes \r\nanimals more sensitive to some anesthetics, and more resistant to others. \r\nIt makes them resistant to the anesthetics that act by promoting the \r\nactions of serotonin, but it prolongs the effects of those that don't \r\nact through serotonin, and these are the anesthetics such as xenon and \r\nnitrous oxide, that apparently act by stabilizing the structure of water, \r\nas described by Linus Pauling. Progesterone and the saturated fats seem \r\nto act partly through the stabilizing of cell water, and estrogen and \r\nthe PUFA have opposing effects, creating cellular excitation while interfering \r\nwith the stable cellular water structure.Serotonin \r\ninterferes with slow wave sleep, and promotes cortisol, both of which \r\ncan be harmful to brain cells. (Hypothyroidism is one of the causes \r\nof a decrease in slow wave sleep.) Babies whose mothers' serum contained \r\nmore DHA were more wakeful on their second day of life, than the babies \r\nof low-DHA mothers. The amide of oleic acid is a sleep promoter, with \r\napparent antiserotonin activity (Yang, et al., 2003), and since oleic \r\nacid tends to be displaced by diets high in PUFA, this suggests another \r\nway in which the highly unsaturated fatty acids could promote serotonin's \r\neffects.People \r\nwho don't have a normal amount of slow wave sleep are likely to have \r\nslow reaction times when they are awake, and quickness of reactions \r\nis a good indicator of general intelligence.Manufacturers \r\nof baby formulas are claiming that the highly unsaturated fatty acids \r\naccelerate brain development, but they neglect to mention studies that \r\nshow either no effect, or retardation of development. In some of the \r\ntests that are used to measure infant development, a generalized state \r\nof arousal or anxiety could be interpreted as \"more mature.\"In \r\none experiment, animals that received less than 0.32% of their calories \r\nas EFA grew slightly less than rats on a standard diet, but their brains \r\nwere as large as those of normal rats (Bruckner, et al., 1984). That \r\nis, their brain to body ratio was a little larger than normal, which \r\nis a typical feature of individuals with a higher metabolic rate. That \r\nresult is very different from the claims of the baby food industry, \r\nthat the brain is the organ most easily damaged by a PUFA deficiency.One \r\nof the standard signs of toxicity is the enlargement of the spleen and \r\nliver, and that effect is produced by larger amounts of the EFA. The \r\nweight of the thymus is reduced by PUFA in the diet (Guimarães, et \r\nal., 1990). Thymus cells tend to be easily killed by a combination of \r\nstress and EFA, and bone marrow cells, though less sensitive than thymic \r\ncells, are damaged by lipid peroxidation of the PUFA. The effects of \r\nPUFA on the thymus were compared to those of radiation by Soviet researchers. \r\nImmunodeficiency, produced largely by damage to thymic cells, increases \r\nwhen larger amounts of PUFA are eaten for a prolonged time.The \r\ngrowth and metastasis of a variety of tumors are inhibited by saturated \r\nfatty acids, and increased by fish oil--as much as 10 times in number \r\nof metastases, 1000 times in size (Griffini, et al., 1998).Mothers \r\nwhose breast milk contains more long-chain n-3 fatty acids are more \r\nlikely to have allergic children (Stoney, et al., 2004). (And children \r\nwhose mothers are allergic have higher levels of DHA and EPA in their \r\ntissues.) These associations aren't mentioned by the manufacturers who \r\nspeak of those fats as essential.When \r\nanimals have been \"deprived\" of the EFA during gestation and \r\nnursing, and then given a standard diet, they develop larger bones, \r\nwith a thicker cortex and more trabecular bone, both of which would \r\nsuggest a lower level of stress. Many types of inflammation and stress \r\nare significantly reduced in \"EFA deficient\" animals. Inflammation \r\ncaused by the injection of carrageenan is decreased, partly because \r\nof the absence of prostaglandins in these animals. The absence of the \r\nEFA protects against colitis and nephritis ( ). The kidneys are more \r\neffective in several ways in the deficient animals.Shock, \r\ncaused by the injection of endotoxin, which is 100% lethal to normally \r\nfed animals, is only 24% lethal to the deficient animals.Poisons \r\nare much less harmful to deficient animals, for example, a cobra venom \r\nfactor causes less tissue damage to their lungs.Concussive \r\ntrauma and burns cause much less damage to deficient animals.The \r\nendothelial lining of blood vessels is protected by saturated fats and \r\noleic acid, damaged by polyunsaturated, and their barrier function is \r\nimproved by the absence of PUFA.Alzheimer's \r\ndisease, retinal degeneration, cataracts, and liver cirrhosis all involve \r\nreactions of oxidized PUFA with proteins. Saturated fats help to heal \r\nalcoholic liver cirrhosis.The \r\nlesions of atherosclerosis and cataracts contain some of the same oxidized \r\nlipids as the age pigment itself. When large deposits of age pigment \r\nbecome visible, it's probably because the general reduction of metabolism \r\nand protein synthesis has interfered with the normal processes for removing \r\ndebris. The age pigment contributes to degeneration by wasting energy \r\nand oxygen, weakening the antioxidation, antiglycation, and other defensive \r\nsystems.The \r\nEFA amplify nearly all kinds of injury and stress, and the results of \r\nmany recent publications make it look as though serotonin interacts \r\nharmfully with the EFA in most of these situations. The specific balance \r\nof polyunsaturated fatty acids, and their various breakdown products, \r\nfrom carbon monoxide, glyoxal, and acrolein, to the larger aldehydes \r\nand radicals, and the stress-induced substances such as serotonin, histamine, \r\nestrogens, can produce an immense variety of biological problems.When \r\nthe various claims of an EFA \"deficiency disease\" or syndrome \r\nor symptom are examined, their inconsistency over the years makes skepticism \r\nseem increasingly justified. The Burrs' publications were typical of \r\nothers, in failing to describe and account for the evidence that contradicted \r\ntheir claims. Claiming that certain fatty acids are essential, a scientific \r\napproach would require showing what was wrong with the experiments that \r\nshowed that they were not essential, and especially, those that showed \r\nthat they were positively harmful.In \r\nthis culture that repeatedly makes such claims of essentiality, the \r\ngrowing number of reports of biological superiority of \"deficient\" \r\nanimals suggests that nutritional research may be near the point at \r\nwhich it can resume the line of study begun by Northrup, Osborne, Mendel, \r\nDrummond, Bernstein, Elias, and others, that was interrupted for 60 \r\nyears by industrial interests that promoted antiscientific opinions.For \r\nexample, in 1914 F.P. Rous showed that limiting food intake reduced \r\nthe incidence of cancer, and then in 1915 and 1917, Osborne and Mendel \r\nshowed that food restriction extended the fertility and longevity of \r\nfemale rats. The association between estrogen and cancer had become \r\nknown during this time, and vitamin E, which was originally known as \r\nthe fertility vitamin, was soon recognized to have antiestrogenic properties, \r\nas well as to prevent the deadly effects of excessive polyunsaturated \r\nfats in the diet. My endocrinology professor, A.S. Soderwall, who had \r\nfound that excess estrogen prevented (or interrupted) pregnancy, demonstrated \r\nthat increased vitamin E extended fertility in aging female rodents.By \r\nthe time I began my research, it seemed clear that it had been the reduction \r\nof PUFA in the diet which, like the addition of vitamin E, had prevented \r\nsterility in the calorie restriction experiments, and that those treatments \r\nhad limited the effects of estrogen in the aging organisms.Estrogen, \r\nby activating phospholipase A2, acts to amplify the toxic effects of \r\nPUFA in the tissues, and these effects increase with age, and with decreased \r\namounts of thyroid and progesterone.Antioxidants \r\ncan slightly retard the cumulative degenerative effects of the fats \r\ninteracting with estrogen, serotonin, and other mediators of inflammation, \r\nbut real elimination of the degenerative diseases will require an exploration \r\nof the effects of the entire series of lipid signalling substances derived \r\nfrom the saturated and omega minus 9 fatty acids.REFERENCESJ \r\nNutr. 2000 Nov;130(11):2855-65.Low arachidonic acid rather than \r\nalpha-tocopherol is responsible for the delayed postnatal development \r\nin offspring of rats fed fish oil instead of olive oil during pregnancy \r\nand lactation.Amusquivar E, Ruperez FJ, Barbas C, Herrera E.Dev. \r\nPsychobiol. 8(1), 59-66, 1985.\"Effects of a commercial soy \r\nlecithin preparation on development of sensorimotor behavior and brain \r\nbiochemicals in the rat,\"Bell, J.

The aim of the present \r\nstudy was to investigate the effect of dietary deficiency of essential \r\nfatty acids (EFA) in the perinatal period on later body weight and bone \r\nmass.During late gestation \r\nand throughout lactation,rats were fed a control or an EFA-deficient \r\n(EFAD) diet. At 3 weeks of age the offspring were weaned onto an ordinary \r\nchow and followed until adult age. The mean body weight of adult rats \r\nreceiving the EFAD diet during the perinatal period was significantly \r\nincreased from 12 weeks of age compared to the controls (P<0.05). \r\nAnalysis by peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (pQCT) at \r\n44 weeks of age showed that the trabecular volumetric bone mineral density \r\n(BMD) of the femur was significantly decreased (P<0.05) but the \r\ncortical bone mineral content, cortical area, and cortical thickness \r\nwere increased(P<0.05) in the EFAD group of rats. The length \r\nof the femur was not affected.In conclusion, neonatal EFA deficiency \r\nwas in adult rats associated with increased body weight and significant \r\nchanges in both cortical and trabecular bone. The results indicate that \r\nregulatory mechanisms related to bone mass seemed to be programmed by \r\nEFAin the perinatal period.

PURPOSE: Dietary fortification of n-9 polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids (PUFA) or 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid (ETrA) as well as n-3 \r\nPUFA might contribute to the suppression of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) synthesis \r\nand thereby reduce inflammatory bowel lesions. As a result, the effect \r\nof an ETrA-enriched diet on experimental bowel lesions was examined \r\nin this study. METHODS: In Expt. 1, rats were freely fed either an ETrA-enriched \r\nor a standard diet. After 7 days of feeding, acute bowel lesions were \r\ninduced by the subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg indomethacin. In Expt. \r\n2, chronic bowel lesions were made by performing subcutaneous injections \r\nof 7.5 mg/kg indomethacin twice. After the first injection, the rats \r\nwere freely fed either an ETrA-enriched or a standard diet for 7 days. \r\nRESULTS: In both experiments, the rats fed an ETrA-enriched diet showed \r\nincreased levels of ETrA in the plasma and intestinal mucosa, and a \r\ndecreased inflammation score. However, there was no significant decrease \r\nin plasma and intestinal mucosal LTB4 in the ETrA-enriched diet-fed \r\nrats. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the dietary supplementation \r\nof ETrA may have both prophylactic and therapeutic effects on experimentally \r\nproduced bowel lesions. Further investigations are necessary to clarify \r\nthe effects of ETrA on bowel lesions and its mechanisms. In \r\n1929 George and Mildred Burr published a paper claiming that unsaturated \r\nfats, and specifically linoleic acid, were essential to prevent a particular \r\ndisease involving dandruff, dermatitis, slowed growth, sterility, and \r\nfatal kidney degeneration. In \r\n1929, most of the B vitamins and essential trace minerals were unknown \r\nto nutritionists. The symptoms the Burrs saw are easily produced by \r\ndeficiencies of the vitamins and minerals that they didn't know about. What \r\nreally happens to animals when the \"essential fatty acids\" \r\nare lacking, in an otherwise adequate diet? Their \r\nmetabolic rate is very high. Their \r\nnutritional needs are increased. They \r\nare very resistant to many of the common causes of sickness and death. They \r\nare resistant to the biochemical and cellular changes seen in aging, \r\ndementia, autoimmunity, and the main types of inflammation. The \r\namount of polyunsaturated fatty acids often said to be essential (Holman, \r\n1981) is approximately the amount required to significantly increase \r\nthe incidence of cancer, and  very careful food selection is needed \r\nfor a diet that provides a lower amount. When \r\nI was studying the age pigment, lipofuscin, and its formation from polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids, I saw the 1927 study in which a fat free diet practically \r\neliminated the development of spontaneous cancers in rats (Bernstein \r\nand Elias). I have always wondered whether George and Mildred Burr were \r\naware of that study in 1929, when they published their claim that polyunsaturated \r\nfats are nutritionally essential. The German study was abstracted in \r\nBiological Abstracts, and the Burrs later cited several studies from \r\nGerman journals, and dismissively mentioned two U.S. studies* that claimed \r\nanimals could live on fat-free diets, so their neglect of such an important \r\nclaim is hard to understand. (*Their bibliography cited, without further \r\ncomment, Osborne and Mendel, 1920, and Drummond and Coward, 1921.) Since \r\n1927, others have demonstrated that the polyunsaturated fats are essential \r\nfor the development of cancer (and some other degenerative diseases), \r\nbut the Burrs' failed to even mention the issue at any time during their \r\ncareers. How could they, studying fat-free diets, have missed an important \r\ncontemporary publication, if I, 40 years later, saw it? There were very \r\nfew publications on dietary fats in those years, so it was hardly possible \r\nto miss it. When \r\nresearchers at the Clayton Foundation Biochemical Institute at the University \r\nof Texas demonstrated that \"Burr's disease\" was actually a \r\nvitamin B6 deficiency, rather than a fatty acid deficiency, the issue \r\nwas settled. Later studies failed to confirm the existence of the Burr \r\ndisease caused by a deficiency of fatty acids, though many similar conditions \r\nwere produced by a variety of other dietary defects. In 1938, a group \r\nin Burr's own laboratory (Brown, et al.) failed to produce dermatitis \r\nin a man during a six month experiment. Neither of the other major features \r\nof the Burr disease, male sterility and kidney degeneration, has been \r\nsubsequently confirmed. The claim that polyunsaturated fatty acid deficiency \r\ncaused sterility of male animals (\"A new and uniform cause of sterility \r\nis shown\") was quickly dropped, probably because anexcessof polyunsaturated fats was discovered to be an important cause of testicular \r\ndegeneration and sterility. One \r\nof the features of the Burrs' rats on the fat-free diet was that they \r\nate more calories and drank much more water than the rats that received \r\npolyunsaturated fatty acids in their diet. They believed that the animals \r\nwere unable to synthesize fat without linoleic acid, although in another \r\ncontext they cited a study in which the fat of rats on a fat-free diet \r\nwas similar in composition to lard:\"McAmis, Anderson, and \r\nMendel[37]fed rats a high sucrose, fat-free diet and rendered \r\nthe fat of the entire animal. This fat had an iodine number of 64 to \r\n71, a fairly normal value for lard.\" The \r\n\"wasteful\" food consumption, and the leanness of animals that \r\nweren't fed polyunsaturated fats became fairly common knowledge by the \r\nlate 1940s, but no one repeated the Burrs' claim that the absence of \r\nthose fatty acids led quickly to the animals' death. Meanwhile, \"crazy \r\nchick disease\" caused by feeding an excess of polyunsaturated fats, \r\nand a little later, \"yellow fat disease,\" caused by too much \r\nfish fat, were being recognized by farmers. In the 1950s, the seed oil \r\nindustry created the anti-cholesterol diet culture, and a few decades \r\nlater, without any new \"Burr-like\" publications, the omega \r\nminus 3 oils, especially fish oils, were coming to be represented as \r\nthe overlooked essential fatty acids, which were capable of preventing \r\nthe toxic effects of the original \"essential\" linoleic acid. Although \r\nthe 1929 Burr paper is still often cited as proof of the essentiality \r\nof PUFA, Burr's younger colleague (at the University of Minnesota Hormel \r\nInstitute), Ralph Holman, has cited an infant (1970), and a 78 year \r\nold woman (in 1969), who developed dermatitis while receiving fat-free \r\nintravenous feedings. Dermatitis, with dandruff, similar to Burr's disease, \r\nhas been produced by various nutritional deficiencies besides vitamin \r\nB6, including a trace mineral deficiency and a biotin deficiency, so \r\nthere is no valid reason to associate dermatitis with a fat deficiency. \r\nThe cases of \"EFA deficiency\" produced by intravenous feedings \r\nthat have been widely cited were probably the result of a deficiency \r\nof zinc or other trace mineral, since so-called \"Total Parenteral \r\nNutrition\" was in use for many years before the trace minerals \r\nwere added to the \"total\" formula. In 1975, I learned that \r\nour local hospital was putting all premature babies on what they called \r\ntotal intravenous feeding, without trace minerals, for weeks, or months. \r\nThere is still more emphasis on polyunsaturated fat in intravenous feeding \r\nthan on the essential trace nutrients. Holman \r\nand the Hormel Institute have been extremely influential in promoting \r\nthe doctrine of the essentiality of PUFA, including fish oils and the \r\nomega -3 oils, but their best evidence, the Burr experiment, doesn't \r\nmake their case. Far worse than that is the effect it has had in distracting \r\nattention from the profoundly toxic effects of the so-called essential \r\nfatty acids. Long after he should have known better, Holman was arguing \r\nthat butter was a nutritionally inferior fat. When \r\nthe Burrs were doing their study, Raymond Pearl was one of the most \r\nfamous biologists in the country, and his \"rate of living\" \r\ntheory of aging was very widely known. According to that theory, an \r\norganism has an intrinsic potential to produce a certain total amount \r\nof energy during its lifetime, and if it metabolizes at a higher than \r\nnormal rate, its life span will be proportionately shorter than normal. There \r\nis general agreement that animals on a fat free diet have a very high \r\nmetabolic rate, but the people who believe the \"rate of living\" \r\ntheory will be inclined to see the increased rate of metabolism as something \r\nharmful in itself. It is clear that this is what the Burrs thought. \r\nThey didn't attempt to provide a diet that provided increased amounts \r\nof all vitamins and minerals, in proportion to the increased metabolic \r\nrate. Pearl \r\ndid an experiment, sprouting cantaloupe seeds in a dish with water. \r\nThe sprouts that grew rapidly died sooner than those that grew more \r\nslowly. They died as soon as the nutrients stored in the endosperm had \r\nbeen consumed. Naturally, when nutrients are depleted, growth and metabolism \r\nmust stop. If food and air and water are rationed, then slow metabolizers \r\nare going to live longer. But when nutritional needs are met, the organisms \r\nwith the highest metabolic rate generally are healthier and live longer. \r\nIn a study of nurses, those who habitually consumed the most calories \r\nlived longer than those who consumed the least. Even while Pearl was \r\npromoting his theory, other famous biologists, for example John Northrup \r\nin Jacques Loeb's lab at the Rockefeller Institute, were making observations \r\nthat contradicted the rate of living theory. For example, around 1916, \r\nNorthrup observed that fruit flies that metabolized at the highest rate \r\nlived the longest. Northrup was doing biology, Pearl was doing propaganda, \r\nfollowing Weismannism. The \r\nidea of extending life span by slowing metabolism and growth was a logical \r\nimplication of the \"rate of living\" theory of aging, and it's \r\nan idea that is still popular. Many people have supposed that eating \r\nless would slow metabolism. Caloric restriction does extend the life \r\nspan of many species, but it generally preserves the high metabolic \r\nrate of youth, so that at a given age the calorie-restricted animal \r\nhas a higher rate of oxygen consumption per gram of body weight than \r\nthe unrestricted eaters. Roy \r\nWalford, a gerontologist who wrote about extending the human life span \r\nto 120 years by caloric restriction, spent 30 years limiting his diet \r\nto about 1600 calories, with little animal protein, almost no saturated \r\nfat--fish once or twice per week, poultry or beef about once, and a \r\nfat free milkshake for breakfast--and after about 15 years, began developing \r\na degenerative brain disease, ALS, one of the nerve diseases involving \r\nlipid peroxidation and excitotoxicity. When he died from the disease, \r\nhe had lived a year longer than the normal life expectancy. V. \r\nStefannson, one of the early polar explorers, spent a winter living \r\nentirely on caribou meat, and felt that it had prevented the scurvy \r\nthat had killed so many of the other explorers, who had counted on fruit \r\nand vegetables to prevent it. But he believed that meat was a metabolic \r\nstimulant that made people age prematurely, as Pearl's rate of living \r\ntheory predicted. Stefannson said that Eskimo women were getting old \r\nin their twenties, and that at the age of 60 they looked as old as Europeans \r\ndid at 80. He was a well informed anthropologist, and his observations \r\nwere probably accurate. The Eskimos he observed ate large amounts of \r\nfish, and other unsaturated fats, and sometimes ate highly decayed fish. \r\nAn accelerated rate of aging would be expected from such a diet, because \r\nof the toxic lipid peroxides. Calorie-restricted \r\nanimals (on a diet of normal composition) have a lower degree of fat \r\nunsaturation in their mitochondria as they age, preserving the relatively \r\nmore saturated fats of youth. Birds' \r\nmitochondrial fats are much less polyunsaturated than those of mammals, \r\nand birds' metabolic rates are much higher, and they live much longer \r\nthan mammals of a similar size. With \r\naging, the highly peroxidizable fatty acids, arachidonic and docosahexaenoic \r\nacid, increase greatly in a variety of tissues, and lipid peroxidation \r\nincreases with aging. Peroxidation slows mitochondrial respiration, \r\nlowering the metabolic rate. Caloric restriction slows the accumulation \r\nof the highly unsaturated fatty acids in mitochondria, and reduces peroxidation. Over \r\nthe years, it has become evident that the polyunsaturated fats are not \r\nvery compatible with a high rate of metabolism, though they are necessary \r\nfor organisms that live at low temperatures and metabolize slowly, such \r\nas fish and vegetables. The saturated fats solidify at low temperature;beef fat is very stiff at refrigerator temperature, and in a fat fish, \r\nsuch stiffness would be lethal. Even \r\nsome hibernating rodents can stay alive with their body tissues close \r\nto the freezing point, and their stored fats have to be unsaturated. \r\nWhen their diet doesn't allow them to store enough polyunsaturated fat, \r\nthey fail to go into hibernation. This is probably a clue to some of \r\nthe general biological effects of the PUFA. A \r\nseries of studies about 20 years ago showed that the functions of the \r\nthyroid hormone are all inhibited by unsaturated fats, with the inhibition \r\nincreasing in proportion to the number of unsaturations (double bonds) \r\nin the fat molecule. When \r\nthe tissues are saturated with those antithyroid fats, metabolism slows, \r\nespecially when any stress, such as cold or hunger, increases the concentration \r\nof free fatty acids in the blood stream. Stress and hypothyroidism increase \r\nthe formation of serotonin, which is an important factor in producing \r\nthe torpor of hibernation, and lowering the body temperature. The polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids themselves directly contribute to the formation of serotonin, \r\nfor example by increasing the ability of tryptophan to enter the brain. \r\nIn a certain cold climate, the PUFA are essential for hibernation, but \r\nunder other conditions, the rodent would be able to continue gathering \r\nfood and eating, instead of hibernating. The \r\ndirect effects of the PUFA on the endocrine and nervous systems, as \r\nillustrated by the hibernating squirrel, interact with their effects \r\non intercellular communication (including the formation of prostaglandins \r\nand related substances), and the effects of their oxidative breakdown \r\nproducts, such as acrolein. But the people who claim that they are absolutely, \r\nrather than conditionally, essential, base their argument on the idea \r\nthat they are needed for the formation of prostaglandins and cell membranes. \r\nThe fact that cells can replicate in fat free conditions shows that \r\nthe argument from membranes is unfounded. The argument from prostaglandins \r\nis more complex, but has no firmer foundation. When \r\na dose of PUFA is administered to a lizard, which isn't a hibernator, \r\nthe lizard's body temperature is lowered by several degrees. There are \r\nprobably many ways in which the PUFA produce that effect, besides increasing \r\nserotonin and decreasing thyroid. The PUFA are increased by estrogen, \r\nand they increase estrogen, and have some directly estrogen-like effects. \r\nEstrogen itself tends to lower body temperature and shift metabolism \r\naway from oxidative energy production. Aging, like estrogen, increases \r\nthe body's content of the PUFA:Linoleic, linolenic, dihomo-gamma-linolenic, \r\ndocosahexaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids are increased by age, and \r\nthe longer chain acids increase more rapidly in women than in men (Bolton-Smith, \r\net al., 1997). (Women are apparently relatively protected by progesterone, \r\nwhich inhibits lipolysis and prostaglandin formation, and protects the \r\nbrain, thymus, and other tissues from lipid peroxidation and other effects \r\nof the PUFA.) Aging \r\ninvolves a decreasing metabolic rate, an increased tendency toward inflammation, \r\nand a decreased ability to synthesize proteins. Inflammation contributes \r\nto the decreasing ability to use oxygen, and the slowed renewal of proteins \r\ncombined with lower ability to produce energy impair the organism's \r\nability to control peroxidative damage and inflammation. The \r\nfragments of deteriorating PUFA combine with proteins and other cell \r\nmaterials, producing immunogenic substances. The so-called \"advanced \r\nglycation end products,\" that have been blamed on glucose excess, \r\nare mostly derived from the peroxidation of the \"essential fatty \r\nacids.\" The name, glycation, indicates the addition of sugar \r\ngroups to proteins, such as occurs in diabetes and old age, but when \r\ntested in a controlled experiment,lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids produces the protein damage about 23 times faster than the \r\nsimple sugars do(Fu, et al., 1996). Several \r\nautoimmune disease models in animals (involving the eye, kidney, and \r\npancreas) have been prevented by a deficiency of the EFA (Schreiner, \r\net al., 1989, Bazan, et al., 1990, Benhamou, et al., 1995). Besides \r\ncausing a general slowing of metabolism, aging and toxic PUFA have specific \r\nactions on the detoxifying system. The enzymes that help to detoxify \r\nPUFA and estrogen and serotonin are inhibited by both PUFA and estrogen. \r\nAll systems, including blood vessels and the intestine, are made leaky \r\nby estrogen and the PUFA and their products. A reduced ability to regulate the excitatory \r\namino acids, resulting from PUFA toxins, tends to produce excitotoxicity, \r\ndamaging nerves (Ou, et al., 2002). Although \r\nthe interplay of the various types of nerve is very complex, a variety \r\nof experiments suggest that the PUFA are acting directly on serotonergic \r\nnerves, rather than just increasing the conversion of tryptophan to \r\nserotonin. For \r\nexample, a deficiency of the so-called essential fatty acids, EFA, makes \r\nanimals more sensitive to some anesthetics, and more resistant to others. \r\nIt makes them resistant to the anesthetics that act by promoting the \r\nactions of serotonin, but it prolongs the effects of those that don't \r\nact through serotonin, and these are the anesthetics such as xenon and \r\nnitrous oxide, that apparently act by stabilizing the structure of water, \r\nas described by Linus Pauling. Progesterone and the saturated fats seem \r\nto act partly through the stabilizing of cell water, and estrogen and \r\nthe PUFA have opposing effects, creating cellular excitation while interfering \r\nwith the stable cellular water structure. Serotonin \r\ninterferes with slow wave sleep, and promotes cortisol, both of which \r\ncan be harmful to brain cells. (Hypothyroidism is one of the causes \r\nof a decrease in slow wave sleep.) Babies whose mothers' serum contained \r\nmore DHA were more wakeful on their second day of life, than the babies \r\nof low-DHA mothers. The amide of oleic acid is a sleep promoter, with \r\napparent antiserotonin activity (Yang, et al., 2003), and since oleic \r\nacid tends to be displaced by diets high in PUFA, this suggests another \r\nway in which the highly unsaturated fatty acids could promote serotonin's \r\neffects. People \r\nwho don't have a normal amount of slow wave sleep are likely to have \r\nslow reaction times when they are awake, and quickness of reactions \r\nis a good indicator of general intelligence. Manufacturers \r\nof baby formulas are claiming that the highly unsaturated fatty acids \r\naccelerate brain development, but they neglect to mention studies that \r\nshow either no effect, or retardation of development. In some of the \r\ntests that are used to measure infant development, a generalized state \r\nof arousal or anxiety could be interpreted as \"more mature.\" In \r\none experiment, animals that received less than 0.32% of their calories \r\nas EFA grew slightly less than rats on a standard diet, but their brains \r\nwere as large as those of normal rats (Bruckner, et al., 1984). That \r\nis, their brain to body ratio was a little larger than normal, which \r\nis a typical feature of individuals with a higher metabolic rate. That \r\nresult is very different from the claims of the baby food industry, \r\nthat the brain is the organ most easily damaged by a PUFA deficiency. One \r\nof the standard signs of toxicity is the enlargement of the spleen and \r\nliver, and that effect is produced by larger amounts of the EFA. The \r\nweight of the thymus is reduced by PUFA in the diet (Guimarães, et \r\nal., 1990). Thymus cells tend to be easily killed by a combination of \r\nstress and EFA, and bone marrow cells, though less sensitive than thymic \r\ncells, are damaged by lipid peroxidation of the PUFA. The effects of \r\nPUFA on the thymus were compared to those of radiation by Soviet researchers. \r\nImmunodeficiency, produced largely by damage to thymic cells, increases \r\nwhen larger amounts of PUFA are eaten for a prolonged time. The \r\ngrowth and metastasis of a variety of tumors are inhibited by saturated \r\nfatty acids, and increased by fish oil--as much as 10 times in number \r\nof metastases, 1000 times in size (Griffini, et al., 1998). Mothers \r\nwhose breast milk contains more long-chain n-3 fatty acids are more \r\nlikely to have allergic children (Stoney, et al., 2004). (And children \r\nwhose mothers are allergic have higher levels of DHA and EPA in their \r\ntissues.) These associations aren't mentioned by the manufacturers who \r\nspeak of those fats as essential. When \r\nanimals have been \"deprived\" of the EFA during gestation and \r\nnursing, and then given a standard diet, they develop larger bones, \r\nwith a thicker cortex and more trabecular bone, both of which would \r\nsuggest a lower level of stress. Many types of inflammation and stress \r\nare significantly reduced in \"EFA deficient\" animals. Inflammation \r\ncaused by the injection of carrageenan is decreased, partly because \r\nof the absence of prostaglandins in these animals. The absence of the \r\nEFA protects against colitis and nephritis ( ). The kidneys are more \r\neffective in several ways in the deficient animals. Shock, \r\ncaused by the injection of endotoxin, which is 100% lethal to normally \r\nfed animals, is only 24% lethal to the deficient animals. Poisons \r\nare much less harmful to deficient animals, for example, a cobra venom \r\nfactor causes less tissue damage to their lungs. Concussive \r\ntrauma and burns cause much less damage to deficient animals. The \r\nendothelial lining of blood vessels is protected by saturated fats and \r\noleic acid, damaged by polyunsaturated, and their barrier function is \r\nimproved by the absence of PUFA. Alzheimer's \r\ndisease, retinal degeneration, cataracts, and liver cirrhosis all involve \r\nreactions of oxidized PUFA with proteins. Saturated fats help to heal \r\nalcoholic liver cirrhosis. The \r\nlesions of atherosclerosis and cataracts contain some of the same oxidized \r\nlipids as the age pigment itself. When large deposits of age pigment \r\nbecome visible, it's probably because the general reduction of metabolism \r\nand protein synthesis has interfered with the normal processes for removing \r\ndebris. The age pigment contributes to degeneration by wasting energy \r\nand oxygen, weakening the antioxidation, antiglycation, and other defensive \r\nsystems. The \r\nEFA amplify nearly all kinds of injury and stress, and the results of \r\nmany recent publications make it look as though serotonin interacts \r\nharmfully with the EFA in most of these situations. The specific balance \r\nof polyunsaturated fatty acids, and their various breakdown products, \r\nfrom carbon monoxide, glyoxal, and acrolein, to the larger aldehydes \r\nand radicals, and the stress-induced substances such as serotonin, histamine, \r\nestrogens, can produce an immense variety of biological problems. When \r\nthe various claims of an EFA \"deficiency disease\" or syndrome \r\nor symptom are examined, their inconsistency over the years makes skepticism \r\nseem increasingly justified. The Burrs' publications were typical of \r\nothers, in failing to describe and account for the evidence that contradicted \r\ntheir claims. Claiming that certain fatty acids are essential, a scientific \r\napproach would require showing what was wrong with the experiments that \r\nshowed that they were not essential, and especially, those that showed \r\nthat they were positively harmful. In \r\nthis culture that repeatedly makes such claims of essentiality, the \r\ngrowing number of reports of biological superiority of \"deficient\" \r\nanimals suggests that nutritional research may be near the point at \r\nwhich it can resume the line of study begun by Northrup, Osborne, Mendel, \r\nDrummond, Bernstein, Elias, and others, that was interrupted for 60 \r\nyears by industrial interests that promoted antiscientific opinions. For \r\nexample, in 1914 F.P. Rous showed that limiting food intake reduced \r\nthe incidence of cancer, and then in 1915 and 1917, Osborne and Mendel \r\nshowed that food restriction extended the fertility and longevity of \r\nfemale rats. The association between estrogen and cancer had become \r\nknown during this time, and vitamin E, which was originally known as \r\nthe fertility vitamin, was soon recognized to have antiestrogenic properties, \r\nas well as to prevent the deadly effects of excessive polyunsaturated \r\nfats in the diet. My endocrinology professor, A.S. Soderwall, who had \r\nfound that excess estrogen prevented (or interrupted) pregnancy, demonstrated \r\nthat increased vitamin E extended fertility in aging female rodents. By \r\nthe time I began my research, it seemed clear that it had been the reduction \r\nof PUFA in the diet which, like the addition of vitamin E, had prevented \r\nsterility in the calorie restriction experiments, and that those treatments \r\nhad limited the effects of estrogen in the aging organisms. Estrogen, \r\nby activating phospholipase A2, acts to amplify the toxic effects of \r\nPUFA in the tissues, and these effects increase with age, and with decreased \r\namounts of thyroid and progesterone. Antioxidants \r\ncan slightly retard the cumulative degenerative effects of the fats \r\ninteracting with estrogen, serotonin, and other mediators of inflammation, \r\nbut real elimination of the degenerative diseases will require an exploration \r\nof the effects of the entire series of lipid signalling substances derived \r\nfrom the saturated and omega minus 9 fatty acids.

        "chunk_html": "Aging Eyes, Infant Eyes, and Excitable TissuesThe eyes \nand the lungs are sensitive tissues that are easily harmed by inappropriate \nenvironmental exposure. They are especially sensitive in infancy and \nold age. For 60 \nyears there have been controversies about the cause of \nretinopathy of prematurity, which has blinded tens of thousands of people. Degeneration \nof the retina is the main cause of blindness in old people. Retinal \ninjury is caused by ordinary light, when the eyes are sensitized by \nmelatonin, prolactin, and polyunsaturated fats. Bright light isn't \nharmful to the retina, even when it is continuous, if the retina isn't \nsensitized. Melatonin \nand prolactin are induced by stress, and darkness is a stress because \nit impairs mitochondrial energy production. The polyunsaturated \nfats which accumulate in the brain and retina damage mitochondria. Iron, \nwhich accumulates prenatally, and then again with aging, reacts with \nunsaturated fats during stress to destroy cells. The popular \nsupplements melatonin, tryptophan, fish oils, St. John's \nwort, and the various omega -3 oils, all increase the risk of retinal \nlight damage and macular degeneration. \nSerotonin uptake inhibiting antidepressants are suspected to be able \nto cause it. Processes \nsimilar to those that damage the over-sensitized retina can occur in \nother cells, as a result of stress. The substances that sensitize the \nretina to light-damage, can also increase the incidence of new or \nmetastatic cancers. Iron supplements and the \nuse of supplemental oxygen, especially with a vitamin E deficiency exacerbated \nby excessive unsaturated fats in the diet, are still commonly used exactly \nwhen they can do the most damage. One \nof the recognized achievements of biology has been the demonstration \nof lifes universality, in the sense that organisms of all sorts use \nthe same fundamental genetic code, and that yeasts, lizards, apes, and \npeople have remarkably similar cellular systems, as well as a great \namount of genetic similarity. There \nhas been another, less well recognized, sort of convergence going on \nin physiology and pathophysiology. Hans Selyes concept of stress, \nthe syndrome of being sick, Otto Warburgs argument that a respiratory \ndefect was behind all kinds of cancer, and the idea of free radical \ndamage as a common factor in disease and aging, helped to create a more \ngeneral way of looking at the nature of disease that superceded medicines \ntheories of disease pathogens and genetic mutations, which created thousands \nof disease entities, none of which had much to do with the individuality \nof the patient or his environment. The \nunderstanding that plants and animals have much biochemistry in common \nhas gradually changed the assumptions of the science establishment, \nwhich until recently insisted that only ionizing radiation could \naffect animals or other organisms that lacked chlorophyll--and insisted \nthat ionizing rays acted only on the DNA. Visible light, the textbooks \nsaid, was not chemically active, and so couldnt possibly affect \nanimals cells. In animals, coloration was seen mainly as decoration \nand disguise, rather than as a functional part of their biochemistry. (Chemically, \nthe meaning of a pigment is that its a chemical which selectively \nabsorbs radiation.Old observations such as \nWarburgs, that visible light can restore the activity of the respiratory \npigments, showed without doubt that visible light is \nbiochemically active.By the 1960s, several studies had been published \nshowing the inhibition of respiratory enzymes by blue light, and their \nactivation by red light. The problem to be explained is why the science \nculture simply couldnt accept crucial facts of that sort.) The \nretina, of course, was allowed (in the views of mainline science) to \nrespond to ordinary light, but the few people who studied the biological \neffects of seasonal or daily cycles of light have until recently stayed \nvery close to the nerve pathways leading from the retina to the pineal \ngland, because those pathways could be described in terms of an evolutionarily \nspecialized third eye. Even with a doctrine of a genetically specialized \nlink between the retina and a little of the animals physiological \nchemistry, the great, slow-witted science establishment has done its \nbest to avoid thoughts of any deep interaction between an organism and \nits environment, by insisting that the organism runs according to a \ngenetically determined clock which is located in a few cells in \na certain area of the brain, and that nervous impulses from the retina \nhave only the small privilege of setting the clock. It \ndidnt matter to the academic and medical worlds that a professor, \nFrank A. Brown, had long ago disproved the idea of an innate genetic \nclock, because philosophy is much stronger than evidence. Leibniz \nhad said that everything in the world runs on its own inner clock, without \nneeding to perceive its surroundings, and this idea that everything \nin the world is a windowless monad resonated through the world \nof science, because it justified the pompous authoritarian attitudes \nof the experts who knew that anything that wasnt already in their \nheads couldnt be considered knowledge.If an organisms essence \nis contained in its genes, then it clearly doesnt interact in \nany meaningful way with most of its environment.This is the sort \nof culture that imbued research on the biology of light cycles. When \nI moved from Mexico, first to Montana and then to Oregon in 1966, I \nbecame very conscious of how light affects the hormones and the health. \n(For example, in Montana I experienced an interesting springtime shedding \nof body hair.) Many people who came to cloudy Eugene to study, and who \noften lived in cheap basement apartments, would develop chronic health \nproblems within a few months. Women who had been healthy when they arrived \nwould often develop premenstrual syndrome or arthritis or colitis during \ntheir first winter in Eugene. The \nabsence of bright light would create a progesterone deficiency, and \nwould leave estrogen and prolactin unopposed. Beginning in 1966, I started \ncalling the syndrome winter sickness, but over the next few years, \nbecause of the prominence of the premenstrual syndrome and fertility \nproblems in these seasonally exacerbated disorders, I began calling \nit the pathology of estrogen dominance. In the endocrinology classes \nI taught at the National College of Naturopathic Medicine, I emphasized \nthe importance of light, and suggested that medicine could be reorganized \naround these estrogen-related processes. If the sparrows of Times Square \nmated in the winter because of the bright lights, it seemed clear that \nbright artificial light would be helpful in regulating human hormones. In \nour lab at the University of Oregon, our hamsters would try to hibernate, \neven though they were in temperature-controlled laboratories with regular \ncycles of artificial light. (The ceiling lights provided only dim illumination \ninside their cage boxes, so they were probably in a chronic state of \nlight deprivation, which probably increased their sensitivity to the \nweak environmental cues that Frank Brown had investigated, possibly \nmicrowaves that easily penetrated the lab walls.) During the winter, \nwhen they were infertile, I found that their thymus glands practically \ndisappeared. The mechanism seemed to include the increase of pineal \ngland activity (probably increasing melatonin synthesis) in the winter, \nunder the intensified activity of the sympathetic nervous system \n(with increased activity of adrenalin and other catecholamines), and \nthe melatonin was apparently a signal for suppressing fertility during \nthe stressful winter. In some animals (Shvareva and Nevretdinova, 1989), \nestrogen is increased during hibernation, contributing to the reduction \nof body temperature. In \n1994 A.V. Sirotkin found that melatonin inhibits progesterone production \nbut stimulates estrogen production, and its widely recognized that \nmelatonin generally inhibits the thyroid hormones, creating an environment \nin which fertilization, implantation, and development of the embryo \nare not possible. This combination of high estrogen with low progesterone \nand low thyroid decreases the resistance of the organism, predisposing \nit to seizures and excitotoxic damage, and causing the thymus gland \nto atrophy. Cyclical \nexposure to melatonin can have an effect on the reproductive system \nopposite to that of chronic exposure, and the way exogenous melatonin \nis delivered to the animal can have unexpected effects on the actual \namount of melatonin circulating in the blood (Wright and Alves, 2001). \nThe actual amount of melatonin in the tissues, its relation to the normal \ncycling of the animal, and the influence of temperature, are often disregarded \nin melatonin research, making it hard to interpret many of the publications. There \nis a lot of talk about melatonins function as an antioxidant, but, \nlike so many other antioxidants, melatonin can act as a pro-oxidant \nat physiologically relevant concentrations;some studies have \nfound that it, like estrogen, increases the activity of the pro-oxidative \nfree radical nitric oxide (which acts like melatonin on pigment cells, \ncausing them to lighten). The promoters of estrogen are also making \nclaims that estrogen is a protective antioxidant, though that isnt \ntrue of physiological concentrations of estrogen, which can catalyze \nintense oxidations. The market culture seems to guide most research \nin these substances. Almost \nany kind of stress increases the formation of melatonin. In \nsome animals, melatonin \nhas been shown to be responsible for whitening of the hair during the \nwinter.  In some species it acts directly on the pigment cells, \nbut in other species it seems to inhibit the action of the melanocyte \nstimulating hormone. In \nsnowy climates, its ecologically rational for animals to turn \nwhite in the winter, for camouflage. But tadpoles also turn white in \nthe dark, or under the influence of melatonin, and the biological meaning \nof that isnt so clear. Its possible that being white would reduce \ntheir loss of heat through radiation, but I think it is more likely \nthat it relates to an increased ability of weak radiation to penetrate \ntheir tissues, rather than being stopped near the surface by the melanin \nin the skin. The absence of melanin makes them more sensitive to light. \nBright light suppresses their melatonin, and makes them turn dark brown \nor black, and this protects them from bright sunlight. In \nthe retina, melatonin increases the sensitivity of the cells to dim \nlight. It, along with prolactin, another nocturnal hormone, helps to \nproduce dark adaptation of the eyes. Melatonin \nincreases the concentration of free fatty acids during the night (John, \net al., 1983; John and George, 1976)), so its interesting that one \nof the long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids, DHA (docosahexaenoic \nacid), also increases the light sensitivity of the retina. Melatonin \nlowers body temperature, causes vasoconstriction in the brain, heart, \nand other organs, and slows reactions. An antagonist to melatonin acts \nas an antidepressant, reducing behavioral despair resulting from \nstress. (Dubocovich, et al., 1990.) So, in the behavioral sense, melatonin \nreduces sensitivity, yet it increases the eyes sensitivity to light, \ncausing them to be injured by light that would otherwise be harmless. Since \na hibernating animal under the influence of melatonin can become very \ncold, the light-sensitizing function of melatonin is probably related \nto the biological need to be roused out of the torpor occasionally. \n(Hibernators apparently have to warm up occasionally to sleep in the \nordinary manner.) Melatonin is said to intensify dreaming, which is \npart of the process of arousal from sleep. All \nof the stress-related hormones increase during the night. One of the \nways these hormones of darkness act is to increase the sensitivity to \nlight, in a process that is an important adaptation for organisms in \ndim light. In the night, our ability to see (and respond to) dim light \nis increased. But dark-adapted eyes are very sensitive to injury by \nbright light. Light that ordinarily wouldnt harm the eyes, will do \nserious damage when the eyes are dark adapted. In \nthinking about the effects of stress and oxygen deprivation, I read \nthe studies demonstrating that the formation of the oxygen-wasting age \npigment, lipofuscin, is increased by estrogen, by oxygen deprivation \n(in carp living below the ice, or even in fetuses), by metals such as \niron, by x-rays, and by highly unsaturated fats. Free \nfatty acids that are mobilized from storage tissues in the night and \nin the winter also tend to increase with aging, as the ability to tolerate \nstress decreases. Poor circulation and lipofuscin tend to be associated, \nin a vicious cycle. This means that the retina becomes easier to injure \nby light in old age, for some of the same reasons that the infants \nretina is susceptible. The \nfetus accumulates a very large amount of iron, and it absorbs melatonin \nfrom the maternal circulation. Prolactin is sometimes elevated in the \nnewborn. Premature babies are often given extra oxygen, which tends \nto cause vasoconstriction by displacing carbon dioxide. Melatonins \nability to cause vasoconstriction means that stress makes supplemental \noxygen more toxic. Synthetic glucocorticoids are often given to premature \nbabies, adding to the risk of retinal damage. When \nthe mother has been given iron supplements during pregnancy, along with \nunsaturated oils in the diet, the baby is likely to be born with a vitamin \nE deficiency and suppressed thyroid function, increasing the probability \nthat it will be jaundiced, leading to treatment of the jaundice with \nexposure to very bright light. Although \nYandell Henderson had already, in 1928, explained the need for carbon \ndioxide to be used with oxygen for resuscitating infants or adults, \nmedical researchers and hospital workers could never accept the idea, \nprobably because of a fundamental misunderstanding of the Henderson-Hasselbalch \nequation. Animal experiments show that supplemental oxygen, without \ncarbon dioxide, causes vasoconstriction, reducing the tissues supply \nof glucose as well as oxygen. In combination with too much light, especially \nblue light, it damages the retina. At hyperbaric pressure, oxygen causes \nseizures, as well as damage to the lungs and other tissues. The \ncontribution of bright light to retinal damage in babies has been denied \nin several recent publications, and these articles undoubtedly provide \nuseful material for defense lawyers to use when hospitals are sued for \ncausing blindness. One publication based on experiments with kittens \nconcludes that bright light does not harm the newborns retina, but \nthe comparison is between continuous light and intermittent light, rather \nthan between bright light and dim light. Twelve hours of total darkness, \nrather than sparing the eye by reducing its exposure to light, would \nsensitize the eye. The only reason such appalling things can be published \nis that their conclusions protect the hospitals. A \nfew good studies of the effect of bright light on the retina, and the \nfact that dark-skinned people with more protective pigment in their \neyes have a lower incidence of retinopathy of prematurity, make it clear \nthat the ordinary laws of physics and chemistry actually do apply to \nthe infant eye. Light \nand stress, especially with excess iron, damage the retina when the \ncells contain too much PUFA, since these fats react with light and free \nradicals. The nocturnal/stress hormones, especially prolactin and melatonin, \nmake the retina more sensitive to light, and more easily damaged. (It's \ntoo much darkness that sets up the problem, since the eyes will adapt \nto excess light, but darkness increases their sensitivity.) The \nuse of lasers to operate on eyes produces intense inflammation of the \neye, but even at low dose the diffusing light causes retinal/macular \ndamage. Cytochrome \noxidase is one of the enzymes damaged by stress and by blue light, and \nactivated or restored by red light, thyroid, and progesterone. It's \na copper enzyme, so it's likely to be damaged by excess iron. It is \nmost active when it is associated with a mitochondrial lipid, cardiolipin, \nthat contains saturated palmitic acid;the substitution of polyunsaturated \nfats lowers its activity. Mitochonrial function in general is poisoned \nby the unsaturated fats, especially arachidonic acid and DHA. Creating \na deficiency of DHA, even when an oil of known toxicity is used \nto replace the omega -3 oils, prevents retinal damage from light. Despite \nevidence of this sort, Mead Johnson is going ahead with the marketing \nof its baby formula containing added DHA which is industrially extracted \nfrom algae. (Although the researchers who claim that DHA is beneficial \nhavent answered my letters, a representative of the company that \nmanufactures it did answer my question about the actual composition \nof the oil, and acknowledged that they dont have any idea what the \nminor ingredients might be.) When \nanimals are made deficient in all the exogenous polyunsaturated \nfatty acids, linoleic and arachidonic acid as well as linolenic and \nDHA, they become remarkably resistant to all sorts of stress and toxins. The \npolyunsaturated fats make the lungs more sensitive to excess oxygen \nor hyperventilation, they make the eyes more sensitive to light, and \nthey make the brain more sensitive to fatigue. The \nuse of synthetic glucocorticoid hormone is standard in treating very \npremature babies, although it is known to contribute to eye damage. \nThis is because it is considered necessary to improve the lung function \nof premature babies with respiratory distress. But there is no clear \nevidence that it is beneficial for lung function in the long run, and \nvery clear evidence that it damages the brain and other organs. There \nis widespread agreement regarding the use of the glucocorticoidsprenatallyto accelerate lung development in women who seem \nlikely to deliver prematurely. Natural cortisol is a factor that promotes \nlung development prenatally. But cortisol is also a signal produced \nby a stressed fetus, that triggers the birth process. Cortisol, or the \nsynthetic glucocorticoid, inhibits progesterone production, and stimulates \nestrogen production, activating uterine contractions and other processes \nthat terminate the pregnancy. Apparently, \nit doesnt occur to many people that administering the glucocorticoid \ntriggers premature birth, creating the problem they are intending to \ntreat. Recognizing \ncausal connections between premature birth and respiratory distress \nand retinopathy of prematurity, it would be obvious that the greatest \neffort should be made to prevent the problems by improving the health \nof pregnant women. Hospitals, however, are invested in high technology \nsystems for treating these problems, and even though their results are \ndismal, they cant make money by getting pregnant women to eat enough \nprotein to prevent preeclampsia, which is a major cause of premature \nbirth, or by treating the problems with salt, magnesium, progesterone, \nthyroid, and aspirin when the women havent had a good diet. Historically, \npreeclampsia has been blamed on the mothers or fetuss bad genes, \nand that cultural bias was the setting in which these high technology \nprenatal and neonatal systems developed. High technology neonatology \nderives from the same ideology that motivated Josef Mengeles genetic \nresearch in Auschwitz. The idea of genetic determination is still motivating \nresistance to reasonable preventive approaches. Thyroid, \ni.e., T3, is very effective in accelerating lung development in the \nfetus, and it doesnt have any of the harmful effects of the synthetic \nglucocorticoids. It normalizes the hormones, increasing progesterone \nand decreasing estrogen, which are needed for full-term gestation, the \nopposite of the glucocorticoids effects. While the cortisol-like \ndrugs damage the brain and other organs, thyroid and progesterone protect \nthem. Old \norganisms, like newborns, are easily injured by all sorts of inappropriate \nexcitation. As in premature babies, the aged eyes, lungs, and brain \nare especially sensitive to damage by stress.But all organs are \nsubject to the same kinds of damage.Medical treatments for respiratory distress and macular degeneration \nin old people are often the same as those used so inappropriately for \nbabies.The good health practices that can prevent the inflammatory \nand degenerative diseases can often make it possible for damaged tissues \nto recover, even in old age. The \npituitary hormones, especially prolactin and TSH, are pro-inflammatory, \nand darkness increases TSH along with prolactin, so to compensate for a light deficiency, the pituitary should be well-suppressed \nby adequate thyroid. Armour thyroid or Thyrolar or Cynoplus, Cytomel, \nwould probably be helpful. (Eye-drops containing T3 might be a way to \nrestore metabolic activity more quickly.) Limiting water intake (or \nusing salt generously) helps to inhibit prolactin secretion. The saturated \nfats protect against the body's stored PUFA, and keeping the blood sugar \nup keeps the stored fats from being mobilized. \nAspirin (or indomethacin) is generally protective to the retina, analogously \nto its protection against sunburn. Adequate vitamin E is extremely important. \nThere are several prescription drugs that protect against serotonin \nexcess, but thyroid and gelatin (or glycine, as in magnesium glycinate) \nare protective against the serotonin and melatonin toxicities. Copper \nand magnesium deficiencies predispose to retinal damage. Red light is \nprotective, blue light (or u.v.) is harmful, so wearing orange lenses \nwould be helpful. Progesterone and pregnenolone, by reducing the stress \nreactions, should be helpful--in the eye diseases of infancy and old \nage, as they are in the respiratory distress syndromes. © Ray Peat 2006.

STRUCTURE AS A REGULATORY \nSYSTEM--AN EMERGING  VISION OF PERVASIVE EPIGENESIS I. INTRODUCTION The \ntoxicity of estrogen and of the unsaturated fats has been known for \nmost of the twentieth century, and much has been learned about their \ninteractions in the aging process. The body, during this time, has been \nunderstood as a dynamic interaction of cellular trophic influences which \ngovern both form and function. My argument here will be that some of \nour adaptive, protective regulatory processes are overridden by the \nexcessive supply of unsaturated fats--supported by a few other toxins--in \nour diet, acting as a false-signal system, and that cholesterol, pregnenolone, \nand progesterone which are our main long-range defenses, are overcome \nby the effects of the unsaturated fats, and that the resulting cascade \nof ineffective and defective reactions (including various estrogen-stimulated \nprocesses) leads to lower and lower energy production, reduced function, \nand death. At certain times, especially childhood and old age, iron \n(which also has important regulatory roles) accumulates to the point \nthat its signal functions may be inappropriate. It \ninteracts with estrogen and unsaturated fats in ways that can change \nrestraint and adaptation into sudden self-destruction, apoptotic cell \ndeath. If we look at the human organism from one perspective, it seems \ncoherent and intelligible, but from the perspective of established academic \nbiological doctrine, it seems appallingly complex, lacking any visible \nintegrating principle, and as a result simplistic mechanical, pharmaceutical, \nor religious ideas are increasingly offered to fill the gap. But experimental \ndata can be taken out of the muddle, and put to coherent human use. \nIn what follows, I am acting as though the doctrines of genetic determination \nand regulation by membranes were mere historical relics. The emerging \ncontrol systems are now clear enough that we can begin to use them to \nreverse the degenerative diseases: Alzheimer's dementia, epileptic dementia, \narthritis, osteoporosis, depression, hypertension, hardening of the \nheart and blood vessels, diabetes, and some types of tumor, immunodeficiencies, \nreflex problems, and special atrophic problems, including clearing of \namyloid and mucoid deposits. I think many people experience regenerative \nage-regressing when many circumstances are just right; for example, \ntaking a trip to the mountains in the spring with friends can optimize \nseveral basic regulatory systems. II. COMMON FACTORS IN BRAIN \nINJURY DURING GROWTH AND AGING Most \npeople are surprised by the number of cells in the prenatal brain, and \nin the very old brain: In the human fetus at 6 months of development, \nthere are about twice as many brain cells as there are at the time of \nbirth, and in old age the number of cells in the brain keeps increasing \nwith age, so that at the age of 90 the amount of DNA in the brain (36.94 \ngrams) is about 50%.greater than at the age of 16-20 (23.04 grams). \nIn the aged brain, glial cells multiply while neurons die. In the fetus, \nthe cells that die are apparently nerve cells that haven't yet matured. \nThe factors that are known to reduce the brain size at birth are also \nfactors that are involved in the degenerating brain in old age or Alzheimer's \ndisease: lack of oxygen, excess unsaturated fats or deficiency of saturated \nfats, estrogen excess, progesterone deficiency, and lack of glucose. \nA lack of carbon dioxide is probably harmful in both. Inflammation and \nblood clots may be factors in the aging brain, and bleeding with vascular \nspasm is sometimes a contributing factor to brain damage in both the \nold and the fetal brain. Endotoxemia may be a factor in nerve degeneration \nonly during adult life, but it is sometimes present during pregnancy. M. C. Diamond, Enriching Heredity: \nThe Importance of the Environment on the Anatomy of the Brain. Free \nPress, N.Y., 1988. C. Finch and L. Hayflick, Handbook of the Biology \nof Aging. Van Nostrand Reinhold, N.Y., 1977. III. A VIEW OF ENTROPY: RENEWAL \nOF THE BRAIN When \na fertilized egg is developing into a person, each cell division creates \na new environment for the daughter cells, to which they adapt. They \nmay run into limits and resistances (sometimes a certain gene doesn't \nmeet the need of the situation, or toxins are present, or nutrients \nand hormones are imperfectly supplied), but the process is flexible, \nand a way is normally found to get around the limitation. The embryo's \nbrain development is my favorite example of the ways genes interact \nwith the environment. We might think of the \"optimal brain development\" \nof a person, or a rat, or a chicken, as something which is clearly limited \nby \"the genes.\" But if rats are given a stimulating environment, \neach generation gets a slightly bigger, slightly more intelligent brain. \nIf rats are treated during pregnancy to increase the amount of progesterone, \nthe offspring have bigger brains and learn more efficiently. Still, \nthat might just be restoring a condition that was natural for rats in \nsome perfect environment. Chickens develop inside an egg shell, and \nso the nutrients needed for their development are all present when the \negg is laid. The \nbrain, like the other organs, stops growing when the food supply is \nused up. But an experimenter (Zamenhof) opened the egg shells at the \nstage of development when the brain normally stops growing, and added \nglucose, and found that the brain continued growing, producing chickens \nwith bigger brains. The \"genes\" of a chicken, as part of a \nsystem, have something to do with the development of that system, but \nthe environment existing in and around the organism is able to guide \nand support the way the system develops. The size, complexity, and intelligence \nof the brain represents a very large part of the \"information\" \n\ncontained in the organism, and Zamenhof's experiment showed that the \nability to realize this potential, to create this complexity, comes \nfrom the support of the environment, and that the \"genetic nature \nof the chicken\" didn't constitute a limit to the development of \nits brain. I \nam going to argue that Alzheimer's disease is analogous to the situation \nconfronted by the developing chicken embryo or the rat or human fetus, \nwhen the environment is unable to meet the needs of the highly energetic, \ndemanding and sensitive brain cells, and the brain cells begin to die, \ninstead of developing into a more complex state, passing beyond various \nbarriers and limitations. There are two stereotypes that are in conflict \nwith this view: (1) That the structure of the brain is determined at \nan early point in life, sometimes explicitly stated as the age of 12 \nor 16, and (2) that the structure of the brain goes into an \"entropic\" \ndeterioration during the process of aging. My position is that the brain \ncells are in a vital developmental process at all times, and that the \nsame things that injure the brain of a fetus also injure the brain of \nan aging person. If \nnovelty is really appearing during development, then it is hard to maintain \nthat \"entropy increases\" during the development of an individual. \nIsn't a child a richer organization than a fertilized egg? Isn't an \nadult more individualized or realized than an infant? Seen from the \ninside, our known world gets richer with experience. Learning is certainly \nanti-entropic. Where does the idea of \"increasing entropy with \nliving\" come from? Many things contribute, including a doctrine \nof genetic determinism, the old Platonic idea of the imperfection of \nthe concrete, the unreality of the existent, and the medieval idea of \nthe \"corruption of the body.\" These philosophies still motivate \nsome people in aging research. The astrophysicist, N. A. Kozyrev, showed \nthat the idea of an \"entropic cosmos\" derived simply from \nthe assumptions of 19th century deism, \"God set the clockwork universe \nin motion, and left it to run down.\" Early in this century, Raymond \nPearl argued that the \"rate of living\" governed the life-span, \nso that \"fast living\" meant a short life. He based his argument \non cantaloupe seeds: the faster they grew, the sooner they died. This \nwas because he didn't give them anything but water, so they had to live \non their stored energy; if they grew quickly, obviously they ran out \nof stored energy sooner. I have never heard that described as a stupid \nidea, but I think politeness is sometimes carried too far. In the clock \nanalogy, or the seed analogy, the available energy is used up. The \nclock with its wound-up spring and the seed in a dish of water may be \nconsidered as closed systems, and we can understand their fate. But \nif it is foolish to argue from a confined seed to free-living organisms, \nthen it is just as foolish to argue from a clock to a cosmos. Unfortunately, \nthese inferences about closed systems are often applied to real situations \nthat aren't energetically closed. The \"rate of living\" \ntheory of aging picked up the idea of aging as a natural physical property \nof time, and gave it expression in mathematical form, arguing (Hershey, \n\"Entropy, basal metabolism and life expectancy,\" Gerontologia \n7, 245-250, 1963) that \"the total lifetime entropy production\" \ncould be calculated, to give insight into \"life expectancy and \nevolutional development.\" Unfortunately, the equation Hershey used \nassumed that the flow of heat out of the body into the surroundings \nis reversible. This suggests an image of Dr. Frankenstein vivifying \nhis monster with lightning, putting the heat back into the body. If \nheat is to be \"put back into the body,\" it is necessary to \nmake sure that it is appropriate for the structure as it exists. Actually, \nit is just the directed flow of energy which generates the structures. \nIf any biological argument can be made from the idea of entropy, it \nis that it would be extremely difficult to regenerate food, by putting \nheat into a person. In a few situations, it is possible to show that \nliving structures can directly absorb heat from their environment (causing \nthe temperature to fall)--\"negative heat production\"--but \nthe exact meaning of this isn't clear. (B. C. Abbott, et al., \"The \npositive and negative heat production associated with a nerve impulse,\" \nProc. R. Soc. B 148, 149, 1958; R. D. Keynes and J. M. Ritchie, \"The \ninitial heat production of amphibian myelinated nerve fibres,\" \nProc. Physiol. Soc., June 1970, page 29P-30P: \"It is now clear \nthat in both crustacean...and mammalian (Howarth, et al., 1968) non-myelinated \nfibres there is an initial production of heat during (or soon after) \nthe action potential, 80% of which is rapidly reabsorbed.\") A. \nI. Zotin (\"Aging and rejuvenation from the standpoint of the thermodynamics \nof irreversible processes,\" Priroda, No. 9, 49-55, 1970), citing \nthe theory of Prigogine-Wiame, argued that the aging process involves \nboth a decrease in entropy and a decrease in the rate of heat production. Regeneration \ninvolves a production of entropy, as when an egg is formed. (The temperature \nfluctuation at the time of ovulation might make a contribution to the \nconstruction of the entropic egg.) The argument that aging of the animal \n(like aging of the cosmos) is governed by \"the tendency of entropy \nto increase\" has led people to say that rejuvenation would be like \nunscrambling an egg. Zotin's argument is interesting, because he says \nthat an egg is a \"scrambled animal.\" This view is very much \nlike Warburg's and Szent-Gyorgyi's theory of cancer, that it is like \na reversion to a simpler state of life. To sketch out what I have argued \nin different contexts, water is the part of the living substance that \nwe can most meaningfully discuss in terms of entropy. In fact, much \nof the concept of entropy has derived from the study of water, as it \nchanged state in steam engines, etc. Cancer cells, like egg cells, have \na higher water content than the differentiated, functioning cells of \nan adult, and the water is less rigidly ordered by the cellular molecules. \nThis different, more mobile state of the water, can be measured by the \nNMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machines which are used for MRI (magnetic \nresonance imaging). Estrogen \nhas a special place in relation to the water in an organism. It is intimately \ninvolved with the formation of the egg cell, and wherever it operates, \nit increases both the quantity of water and, apparently, the disorder \nof the water. Its function, I believe, is to promote regeneration, as \nin Zotin's scheme, by increasing entropy, or \"scrambling the animal.\" \nThe way it promotes regeneration is by promoting water uptake, stimulating \ncell division, and erasing the differentiated state to one degree or \nanother, providing a new supply of \"stem cells,\" or cells \nat the beginning of a certain sequence of differentiation. These more \nnumerous cells then must find a hospitable environment in which to develop \nand adapt. If the proper support can't be found, then they will be recycled, \nlike the unfed cells in the brain of a fetus. If we imagine the course \nof development as a summary of evolution (\"ontogeny recapitulating \nphylogeny\"), then the egg, as it \"unscrambles\" itself \nin embryonic development, passing through stages resembling jelly fish, \nworm, fish, reptile, bird, baboon, keeps finding that the available \nenergy allows it to, in effect, say \"I want this, I don't want \nthat,\" until it emerges as a human baby, saying \"I want,\" \n\nand begins eating and learning, and with luck continues the unscrambling, \nor self-actualization.. Degenerative aging, rather than being \"physically \nderived from the properties of time,\" seems to be produced situationally, \nby various types of contamination of our energy supply. Unsaturated \nfats, interacting with an excess of iron and a deficiency of oxygen \nor usable energy, redirect our developmental path. The \nsaturated fats, in themselves, seem to have no \"signalling\" \nfunctions, and when they are naturally modified by our desaturating \nenzymes, the substances produced behave very differently from the plant-derived \n\"eicosanoids.\" As far as their effects have been observed, \nit seems that they are adaptive, rather than dysadaptive. All of the \nfactors that affect the brain of a fetus should be examined in relation \nto the aging brain. Besides estrogen and fats, I am thinking of oxygen \nand carbon dioxide, glucose, iron and calcium, cholesterol, progesterone, \npregnenolone, DHEA, the endorphins, GABA, thyroid, and vitamin A. An \nadditional factor, endotoxin poisoning, eventually tends to intervene \nduring stress and aging, exacerbating the trend begun under the influence \nof the other factors. IV. FALSE SIGNALS FROM THE \nENVIRONMENT The environment can be supportive, \nbut it can also divert development from an optimal course. Passively \ntaking whatever you are given, by history and nature, is entropic; choosing \nintelligently from possible diets, selecting courses of action, will \ncreate pattern and reduce entropy. If education contains an element \nof choice and self-actualization, then the results seen in several Alzheimer's \nstudies could have a significance larger than what has been suggested \nby the investigators. A diagnostic bias has been reported to result \nfrom the use of standardized tests based on vocabulary, because education \nincreases vocabulary, and tends to cover up the loss of vocabulary that \noccurs in dementia. In the Framingham study, it was concluded that there \nwas a real association of lower educational level with dementia, but \nthe suggestion was made that self-destructive practices such as smoking \nwere more common among the less educated. The \nSeattle study of the patients in a health maintenance organization showed \na very distinct difference in educational level between the demented \nand the non-demented, both of whom had roughly similar frequency of \nprescriptions for estrogen. The features that seemed important to me, \nthat weren't discussed by the authors, were that the demented women \nhad a much lower rate of progestogen use, and a much higher incidence \nof hysterectomy, which interferes with natural progesterone production. \nAlthough Brenner, et al., in the Seattle study concluded that \"this \nstudy provides no evidence that estrogen replacement therapy has an \neffect on the risk of Alzheimer's disease in postmenopausal women,\" \nthey reported that \"Current estrogen use of both the oral and the \nvaginal routes had odds ratios below 1, while former use of both types \nyielded odds ratios above 1....\" (They seem to neglect the fact \nthat Alzheimer's-type disease in old people has a long developmental \nhistory, so it is precisely the \"former\" use that is relevent. \n31% of the demented women had formerly used estrogen, and only 20% of \nthe control group. Since estrogen is a brain excitant, present use creates \nexactly the same sort of effect on verbal fluency and other signs of \nawareness of the environment that a little cocaine does. Anyone who \nneglects this effect is probably deliberately constructing a propaganda \nstudy.) This \nobservation, that the demented had 155% as much former estrogen use \nas the normal group, as well as the difference in rates of progestogen \nuse (normal patients had 50% more progestogen use than demented) and \nhysterectomy (demented had 44.1% vs. 17% in the normals, i.e., 259% \nas many; the incidence of hysterectomies after the age of 55, which \nis a strong indication of a natural excess of estrogen, in the demented \nwas 374% of the incidence in the non-demented), should call for a larger \nstudy to clarify these observatons, which tend to indicate that exposure \nto estrogen in middle-age increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease \nin old age, and that even medical progestogens offer some protection \nagainst it.. (Although \nthis study might have been bigger and better, it is far better than \nthe junk-studies that have been promoted by the pharmaceutical publicity \nmachine. I have seen or heard roughly 100 mentions of the pro-estrogen \nanti-scientific \"studies,\" and none mentioning this one.) D. E. Brenner, et al., Postmenopausal \nestrogen replacement therapy and the risk of Alzheimer's disease: A \npopulation-based case-control study,\" Am. J. Epidemiol. 140, 262-267, \n1994. \"Women tend to have higher age-specific prevalence and incidence \nrates of Alzheimer's disease than do men.\" A.F. Jorm, The Epidemiology \nof Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, Chapman and Hall, London, \n1990, and W. A. Rocca, et al., Ann. Neurol. 30, 381-190, 1991. H. C. Liu, et al., \"Performance \non a dementia screening test in relation to demographic variables--study \nof 5297 community residents in Taiwan,\" Arch. Neurol. 51(9), 910-915, \n1994. \"Commonly used dementia screening tests may be unfair to \npoorly educated individuals, especially women and rural residents.\" SIGNALS IN THE ABSTRACT When \nI taught endocrinology, I annoyed my tidy-minded students by urging \nthem to consider the potential hormone-like action of everything in \nthe body, and to think of layers of control, ranging from sugar, salt, \nand carbon dioxide, through the \"official hormones,\" to complex \nnervous system actions such as expectancy, and biorhythms. Certain things \nthat are active in very important processes deserve special attention \nas \"signals,\" but they still have to be understood in context. \nIn this sense, we can think of Ca2+ as a signal substance, in its many \ncontexts; it is strongly regulated by the cell's energy charge. Magnesium \nand sodium antagonize it in certain situations. Linoleic acid, linolenic \nacid, arachidonic acid: Their toxicity is potentially prevented by the \nMead acids, and their eicosanoid derivatives, which behave very differently \nfrom the familiar prostaglandins, as far as they have been compared; \ncan be drastically reduced by dietary changes. Prostaglandins, prostacyclin, \nthromboxane: Formation is blocked by aspirin and other antiinflammatory \ndrugs. Adenosine: \nSleep inducing protective effect. Adenosine is structurally very similar \nto inosine, another natural substance (found in meat, for example) which \nis a component of \"inosiplex,\" an antiviral drug (Brown and \nGordon, Fed. Proc. 29, 684, 1970, and Can. J. Microbiol. 18, 1463, 1972) \nor immunostimulant which has also been found to have an anti-senility \neffect (Doty and Gordon, Fed. Proc. 29). Adenosine is a free radical \nscavenger, and protects against calcium and glutamate excitotoxicity. \n(I. Yokoi, et al., \"Adenosines scavenged hydroxyl radicals and \nprevented posttraumatic epilepsy,\" Free Radical Biol. Med. 19(4), \n473-479, 1995; M. P. Abbracchio, et al., \"Adenosine A(1) receptors \nin rat brain synaptosomes: Transductional mechanisms, efects on glutamate \nrelease, and preservation after metabolic inhibition,\" Drug Develop. \nRes. 35(3), 119-129, 1995.) It also appears to protect against the relative \nhyperventilation that wastes carbon dioxide, and endotoxin can interfere \nwith its protective action. Guanosine, in this same group of substances, \nmight have some similar properties. Thymidine and cytidine, which are \npyrimidine-based, are endogenous analogs of the barbiturates, and like \nthem, they might be regulators of the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Uridine, \nin this group, promotes glycogen synthesis, and is released from bacteria \nin the presence of penicillin. Iron: \nRegulator of mRNA stability, heme synthesis; reacts with reductants \nand unsaturated oils, to produce free radicals and lipid peroxides; \nits absorption is increased by estrogen, hypothyroidism, anemia or lack \nof oxygen. Glutamate and aspartate, excitotoxins, and GABA, an inhibitory \ntransmitter. These \nhave metabolic links with each other, with ammonia, and with stress \nand energy metabolism. Estrogen \nand acetylcholine, excitotoxins; see Savolainen, et al., 1994. The information \non this is overwhelmingly clear, and the publicity to the contrary is \na horrifying example of the corruption of the mass media by the drug \nindustry. Endorphins: \nStress induced, laterally specific, involved in estrogen action, antagonized \nby naloxone and similar anti-opiate drugs. I have proposed that the \nendorphins can cause or sustain some of the symptoms of aging. Naloxone \nappears to be a useful treatment for senility. E. Roberts, Ann. N. Y. \nAcad. Sci. 396, 165, 1982; B. Reisberg, et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 308, \n721, 1983. Endotoxin: \nAntimitochondrial action, causes elevation of estrogen. It synergizes \nwith unsaturated fats, and naloxone opposes some of its toxic effects. Urea, \ncholesterol: Structural stability of proteins and lipid-protein complexes. Things \nthat act directly on the water structure: I think all of the natural \nregulators have an effect on the structure of water, but some unusual \nsubstances seem to act primarily on the water. Noble gases, for example, \nhave no chemical effects, but they tend to form \"cages\" of \nwater molecules around themselves. Camphor, adamantane, and the antiviral \ndrug amantadine, probably have a similar water-structuring effect, and \namantadine, which is widely used as a therapy in Parkinson's disease, \nhas an anti-excitotoxic action.

HORMONE \nIMBALANCE, LEADING TO FAILURE OF PROTECTIVE INHIBITION AND ALZHEIMER'S \nDISEASE \"All \ncell death is characterized by an increase of intracellular calcium....\"  \n\"Increase of cytoplasmic free calcium may therefore be called 'the \nfinal common path' of cell disease and cell death.  Aging as a \nbackground of diseases is also characterized by an increase of intracellular \ncalcium.  Diseases typically associated with aging include hypertension, \narteriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and dementia.\" THE FUNCTION \nOF ENERGY Most \npeople are slightly demented now and then, when they are very sleepy \nor tired, or sick, or drunk, or having a hormone imbalance or extreme \nanxiety state.  Sometimes physicians have described people as demented, \nimplying that the condition would never improve, when the person was \ndepressed or hypothyroid.  If the person has a history of epilepsy, \nor is very old, the physician is more likely to diagnose dementia than \nif the same loss of mental function occurs in a younger person without \na history of a nervous disorder.  Even people with less education \nare at increased risk of being diagnosed as \"demented.\" In \n1976, I saw a 52 year-old woman who had the diagnosis of epileptic dementia.  \nAfter 3 or 4 days of taking progesterone, her mental function returned \nto the extent that she could find her way around town by herself, and \ncould work.  A few months later, she returned to graduate school, \ngot straight As and a master's degree.  A few years later, a man \nin his 80s showed the classical signs of senile dementia, with childishness, \nconfusion, self-centeredness, and unstable emotions.  A few days \nafter getting a mixture of thyroid, pregnenolone, and progesterone, \nhis mind was again clear, and he was able to work on a research project \nhe had set aside years before. When \nthe body temperature is very much below normal, mental functioning is \nseriously limited.  I think the first question that should be asked \nabout a demented person is \"is this the cold brain syndrome, or \nis something else involved?\" When it is known that the brain has \nshrunken drastically, and filled up with plaques and developed gliosis, \nwe know that something more than a \"cold brain\" is involved, \nbut we don't know how much function could be regained if the hormones \nwere normalized.  Every moment of malfunction probably leaves its \nstructural mark.  Early or late, it is good to prevent the functional \nerrors that lead to further damage, and to give the regenerative systems \nan opportunity to work.  Before the final \"calcium death\" \n\ndescribed (above) by Fujita, there are many opportunities for intervening \nto stop or reverse the process.  The older the person is, the more \nemphasis should be put on protective inhibition, rather than immediately \nincreasing energy production.  Magnesium, carbon dioxide, sleep, \nred light, and naloxone might be appropriate at the beginning of therapy. The \nresting state of a cell is a highly energized state.  To the old \nPavlovians, the resting state existed at two energy levels, and they \napplied the term \"protective inhibition\" generally to the \ndepleted state (parabiosis) that occurs in exhaustion or coma, but I \nam using the phrase in a more general sense, that seems reasonable now \nthat the concept of \"excitotoxic\" injury has become current.  \nI mean it to include everything which protects against excitotoxic injury.  \nThis definition therefore has the virtue of being biochemically and \nphysiologically very specific, while retaining the functional and therapeutic \nsignificance that it had for the Pavlovians.  (My book,Mind \nand Tissue,and the chapter \"A unifying principle\" inGenerative Energy,discussed the idea of the resting state and protective \ninhibition.) Ordinary \nhealthy sleep is an example of restorative, protective inhibition.  \nThe energy charge, including levels of ATP, creatine phosphate, and \nglycogen storage, regulates many restorative enzyme systems.  I \nhave suggested (1975, J. Orthomol. Psychiatry) how the entropy-sensitivity \nor cold-inactivation of an enzyme could be involved in shifting the \nbrain toward a state of inhibition.  A recent publication (J. H. \nBenington and H. C. Heller, \"Restoration of brain energy metabolism \nas the function of sleep,\" Progress in Neurobiol. 45, 347-360, \n1995) has proposed that reduction of energy charge and depolarization \nof cells act through adenosine secretion to restore glycogen stores.  \nSince glycogen stores decrease with aging, this work supports the idea \nthat protective inhibition is weakened with aging.  (L. N. Simanovskiy \nand Zh. A. Chotoyev, \"The effect of hypoxia on glycogenolysis and \nglycolysis rates in the rat brain,\" Zhurnal Evolyutsionnoy Biokhimii \ni Fiziologii 6(5), 577-579, 1970.) The \nterms \"functional quiescence\" and \"G0 quiescence\" \n\nare similar in meaning to the resting state; I think of cells in the \nstate of \"G0 quiescence\" as being stem cells, waiting for \nuse in regeneration, but I don't subscribe to the idea that they can't \nbe reconstituted from functioning, differentiated cells.  In plants, \ndedifferentiation is achieved fairly easily, and in the study of animal \ncells the trend in that direction seems very obvious, though many people \nkeep saying that it just isn't possible.  In general, the things \nsuch as lipid peroxidation or calcium influx which cause cell replication \nat one level, cause cell death at a higher level. Energy \nto resist stress makes quiescence possible, and prevents the deterioration \nof cells, of the sort that occurs in aging.  O. Toussaint, et al., \n\"Cellular aging and energetic factors,\" Exp. Gerontology 30(1), \n1-22, 1995.  \"Experiments performed with endothelial cells \nin the context of the ischemia-reperfusion toxicity of free radicals, \nalso offer good examples of the impact of cell energy on cell resistance \nto these toxic molecules.\"  \"...if a supplement of energy \nis given...the toxic effect of the free radicals is much reduced....\" The \nspecific approaches of this orientation --to energize but quiet the \nbrain--are diametrically opposed to some of the \"therapies\" \n\nfor Alzheimer's disease that have been promoted recently by the drug \nindustries:  Things to increase stimulation, especially to increase \ncholinergic excitation; even the excitotoxic amino acids themselves \nand their analogs; and estrogen, which is a multiple brain excitant, \nproconvulsant, excitotoxic promoter, and anti-memory agent.  Those \nproduct-centered publications stand out distinctly from the actual research. There \nare many energy-related vicious circles associated with aging, but the \ncentral one seems to be the fat-thyroid-estrogen-free-radical-calcium \nsequence, in which the ability to produce stabilizing substances including \ncarbon dioxide and progesterone is progressively lost, increasing susceptibility \nto the unstable unsaturated fats. EFFECTS OF ESTROGEN \nAND UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS Estrogen \nproduction is facilitated when tissue is cooler, and it lowers body \ntemperature.  Estrogen and the endorphins act together in many \nways (including the behavior of estrus), and naloxone (the antagonist \nof morphine and the endorphins) raises body temperature and in other \nways opposes estrogen.  Naloxone has been found to improve the \nsymptoms of demented people, and I have seen it quickly, and dramatically, \nimprove the mental clarity of a 60 year old woman who had used estrogen.  \nIt, like clonidine (the anti-adrenaline drug), is a good candidate for \ncontrolling the hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause. In \nvarious degenerative brain conditions, blood clotting has been implicated \neither as a cause or a complication.  Many people are promoting \nunsaturated oils for their \"anti-clotting\" value, in spite \nof the older literature showing that they inhibit proteolytic enzymes \nand slow clot removal.  Several newer publications have revealed \nother aspects of their involvement in thrombus formation.  A. J. \nHonour, et al., \"The effects of changes in diet on lipid levels \nand platelet thrombus formation in living blood vessels,\" Br. J. \nExpt. Pathol. 59(4), 390-394, 1978--corn oil caused platelets to be \nmore sensitive to ADP. Although \nthere is a lot of talk about \"membrane fluidity,\" as a desirable \nthing, and the loss of unsaturated lipids in the aged brain, there are \nsome interesting observations related to \"viscosity\" in Alzheimer's \ndisease.  The platelets of Alzheimer's patients are less viscous, \nand lipids extracted from the brain are more fluid, and contain 30% \nless cholesterol than normal (on a molar basis, in relation to phospholipids).  \n(G. S. Roth, et al., 1995.)  In general, lipid peroxidation causes \ncellular viscosity to increase, apparently by causing cross-linking \nof proteins, but I think the significance of the decreased cholesterol \nrelates to its significance as precursor to pregnenolone and progesterone, \nand to the known association with Alzheimer's disease of a variant form \nof the cholesterol transporter protein, ApoE, which I suppose is a slightly \nless stable molecular form that is more susceptible to malfunction in \nstress. The \nextracellular matrix is a major factor in the function and stability \nof brain cells. (L. F. Agnati, et al., \"The concept of trophic \nunits in the central nervous system,\" Prog. in Neurobiol. 46, 561-574, \n1995.  Any factor producing edema tends to disrupt the extracellular \nmatrix (Chan and Fishman, 1978, 1980, and L. Loeb, 1948.) Seizures \nare known to be promoted by estrogen, by unsaturated fats, and by lipid \nperoxidation, and to cause an increase in the size of the free fatty \nacid pool in the brain.  Prolonged seizures cause nerve damage \nin certain areas, especially the hippocampus, thalamus, and neocortex \n(Siesjo, et al., 1989).  Dementia is known to be produced by prolonged \nseizures. Prenatal \nexposure to estrogen, to oxygen deficiency, or to unsaturated fats decreases \nthe size of the brain at birth.  There is apparently a requirement \nfor saturated fats during development (J. M. Bourre, N. Gozlan-Devillierre, \nO. Morand, and N. Baumann, \"Importance of exogenous saturated fatty \nacids during brain development and myelination in mice,\" Ann. Biol. \nAnim., Biochim., Biophys. 19(1B), 172-180, 1979. Under \nthe influence of estrogen, or unsaturated fats, brain cells swell, and \ntheir shape and interactions are altered.  Memory is impaired by \nan excess of estrogen.  Estrogen and unsaturated fat and excess \niron kill cells by lipid peroxidation, and this process is promoted \nby oxygen deficiency.  The fetus and the very old have high levels \nof iron in the cells.  Estrogen increases iron uptake.  Estrogen \ntreatment produces elevation of free fatty acids in the blood, and lipid \nperoxidation in tissues.  This tends to accelerate the accumulation \nof lipofuscin, age-pigment.  Lactic acid, the production of which \nis promoted by estrogen, lowers the availability of carbon dioxide, \nleading to impairment of blood supply to the brain. Estrogen \nstimulates cell division, but can also increase the rate of cell death.  \nUnsaturated fatty acids can also stimulate or kill. Both \nestrogen and unsaturated fats promote the formation of age-pigment.  \nBesides increasing the free fatty acid concentration, estrogen possibly \ndepresses the level of cholesterol, both of which are changes seen in \nthe senile brain. Estrogen \ncauses massive alterations of extracellular matrix, and seems to promote \ndissolution of microtubules (Nemetschek-Gannsler), as calcium does.  \nUnsaturated fats increase calcium uptake by at least some brain cells \n(H. Katsuki and S. Okuda, 1995.)  Unsaturated fats, like estrogen, \nincrease the permeability of blood vessels.  The unsaturated fat \ncauses edema of the brain, inhibits choline uptake, blocking acetylcholine \nproduction. Progesterone \nis a nerve growth factor, produced by glial cells (oligodendrocytes).  \nIt promotes the production of myelin, protects against seizures, and \nprotects cells against free radicals.  It protects before conception, \nduring gestation, during growth and puberty, and during aging.  \nIt promotes regeneration.  Its production is blocked by stress, \nlipid peroxidation, and an excess of estrogen and iron. Aspirin \nprotects against iron toxicity, clot formation, and reduces lipid peroxidation \nwhile blocking prostaglandin formation.  Aspirin and other antiinflammatory \ndrugs, taken for arthritis, have been clearly associated with a reduced \nincidence of Alzheimer's disease.  Aspirin reduces the formation \nof prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. Unsaturated \nfatty acids, but not saturated fatty acids, are signals which activate \ncell systems. Many \ndifferent stimuli can induce cell activity, cell death, or change to \nanother cell type.  (J. Niquet, et al., \"Glial reaction after \nseizure induced hippocampal lesion:  Immunohistochemical characterization \nof proliferating glial cells,\" J. Neurocytol. 23(10), 641-656, \n1994:  \"...hippocampal astrocytes from kainate-treated rats \nexperess A2B5 immunoreactivity, a marker of type-2 astrocytes.\"  \n\"This suggests that in the CNS, normal resident astrocytes acquire \nthe phenotypic properties of type-2 astrocytes.\") A \n\"deficiency\" of polyunsaturated fatty acids leads to altered \nrates of cellular regeneration and differentiation, a larger brain at \nbirth, improved function of the immune system, decreased inflammation, \ndecreased mortality from endotoxin poisoining, lower susceptibility \nto lipid peroxidation, increased basal metabolic rate and respiration, \nincreased thyroid function, later puberty and decreases other signs \nof estrogen dominance.  When dietary PUFA are not available, the \nbody produces a small amount of unsaturated fatty acid (Mead acids), \nbut these do not activate cell systems in the same way that plant-derived \nPUFAs do, and they are the precursors for an entirely different group \nof prostaglandins. VITAMIN A AND \nTHE STEROIDS In \na variety of cell types, vitamin A functions as an estrogen antagonist, \ninhibiting cell division and promoting or maintaining the functioning \nstate.  It promotes protein synthesis, regulates lysosomes, and \nprotects against lipid peroxidation.  Just as stress and estrogen-toxicity \nresemble aging, so does a vitamin A deficiency.  While its known \nfunctions are varied, I think the largest use of vitamin A is for the \nproduction of pregnenolone, progesterone, and the other youth-associated \nsteroids.  One of vitamin E's important functions is protecting \nvitamin A from destructive oxidation.  Although little attention \nhas been given to the effects of unsaturated fats on vitamin A, their \ndestruction of vitamin E will necessarily lead to the destruction of \nvitamin A.  The increased lipid peroxidation of old age represents \na vicious circle, in which the loss of the antioxidants and vitamin \nA leads to their further destruction. To \nproduce pregnenolone, thyroid, vitamin A, and cholesterol have to be \ndelivered to the mitochondria in the right proportion and sufficient \nquantity.  Normally, stress is balanced by increased synthesis \nof pregnenolone, which improves the ability to cope with stress.  \nLipid peroxidation, resulting from the accumulation of unsaturated fatty \nacids, iron, and energy deficiency, damages the mitochondrias' ability \nto produce pregnenolone.  When pregnenolone is inadequate, cortisol \nis over-produced.  When progesterone is deficient, estrogen's effect \nis largely unopposed.  When both thyroid and progesterone are deficient, \neven fat cells synthesize estrogen. THE NATURE OF \nALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Although \nAlzheimer's disease until recently referred to a certain type of organic \ndementia occuring in people in their thirties, forties and fifties (presenile \ndementia), structural similarities seen in senile dementia have caused \nthe term to lose its original meaning.  Alzheimer's sclerosis of \nblood vessels, and even the death of nerve cells, are sometimes neglected \nin favor of the more stylish ideas, emphasizing certain proteins that \ncause the tangles and plaques.  Until recently, the \"tangles\" \nwere commonly interpreted as the debris left after the death of a cell, \nrather than as one of the processes causing the death of the cell. Alzheimer-type \ndementia is different from other dementias, but it overlaps with them, \nand with age-related and stress-related changes in other organs. Physical signs \n(seen at autopsy) of AD: 1) \nDeath of neurons (increase of glial cells), 2) \nAmyloid plaques (extracellular), associated with a particular variant \nof apolipoprotein E, the epsilon 4 allele, 3) \nFibrillary tangles (intracellular, or remaining after the rest of the \ncell has disappeared), 4) \nAmyloid in blood vessels. Functional and \nbiochemical observations: 1) \nThe mitochondrial energy problem, cytochrome oxidase and its regulation; \nbody temperature/pulse-rate cycle disturbance; lipid peroxidation; respiratory \ndefect; altered amino acid uptake; memory impairment; dominance of the \nexcitatory systems vs. the inhibitory adenosine/GABA/progesterone/pregnenolone \nsystem.  Increased calcium uptake, which is associated with lipid \nperoxidation and cell death.  Increased cortisol and DHEA. 2)  \nDeposit of abnormal proteins, such as transthyretin-amyloid; albumin \nbinding of PUFA, vs. transport of thyroid and retinol.Beta-glucuronidase increases, depositing estrogen in cells. ) 3)Abnormally phosphorylated (tau) proteins; association with the variant \nform of Apo E; tau microtubule organizing proteins, microtubules are \ninvolved in transporting cholesterol; phosphorylation, by the kinase \nsystems, regulated by PUFA; the intermediate filaments are generally \nstress-associated. 4) \nApoE, in cytoplasm, involved in cholesterol delivery for pregnenolone \nsynthesis, as in the adrenal; its expression regulated by thyroid.  \nRegulation of the side-chain cleaving enzymes; regulation of the cholesterol \nintake and conversion to pregnenolone by the endozepine receptor/GABA \nreceptor, modified by progesterone. AN EXAMPLE OF \nA REGULATORY PROBLEM Vegetable \noil suppresses the thyroid, increasing estrogen.  Estrogen and \ncalcium depolymerize microtubules.  Microtubule transport for Apo \nE, transthyretin, thyroid, and cholesterol for pregnenolone synthesis \nis disrupted.  Transthyretin and Apo E accumulate unused, and deposit \nin blood vessels, around nerves, and in cytoplasm.  Pregnenolone \nand progesterone deficiency (aggravating thyroid deficiency) causes \nmemory loss, destabilization of nerve cells, failure of myelin formation, \nand excess cortisol synthesis.  Free radicals and calcium cause \nmultiple cell injuries including nerve-death.  Estrogen is released \nby elevated beta-glucuronidase.  Imbalances of other steroids, \nincluding cortisol and DHEA, develop as cells compensate for pregnenolone \ndeficiency, causing shifts in balance of glial cells.  Hypothyroidism, \nestrogen excess, free unsaturated fats cause increased vascular permeability \nand brain edema, protein leakage, and alteration of the matrix.. VIII:  \nSTRUCTURE AS A REGULATORY SYSTEM--AN EMERGING VISION OF PERVASIVE EPIGENESIS In \nthe introduction I mentioned that membranous regulation and genetic \ndetermination should be considered as defunct theories.  What I \nhave been saying about self-actualizing systems and the factors that \ndisrupt them derives from a view of cell function that has been developing \nsince the 1920s. Around \n1940, a Russian biochemist (Oparin, I think) proposed that the enzymes \nof glycolysis were bound to the structure of the cell when they were \nnot in use, and that they were \"desorbed\" under the conditions \nthat required abundant glycolysis.  Knowing that concept, in 1970 \nI proposed that the cell water itself underwent a transition under such \nconditions (which could include increased temperature, reduced oxygen, \nor nervous or hormonal stimulation).  Activation of glycolysis \nis usually explained by the availability of regulatory substances such \nas ammonia, phosphate, and NAD, and many biochemists were content to \nunderstand cells in terms of test-tube models.  But in the last \nfew years, it has become clear that some of these basic regulatory molecules \ndo bind to structural components of the cell.  (T. Henics, \"Thoughts \nover cell biology:  A commentary,\" Physiol. Chem. Phys. & \n\nMed. NMR 27, 139-140, 1995.)  Although the details aren't clear, \nit is known that hormones and other factors stabilize or destabilize \nRNA, and that during some of these events relevant enzymes bind to the \nRNA.  When these facts are combined with the information that is \naccumulating on splicing and modification of RNA, and the copying of \nRNA back into DNA, the hereditary system is seen to be much more flexible \nthan it was believed to be. A \nglobal change of state is able to steer each part of the process, continuously.  \nIn this way, the cell resembles an analog, rather than a digital, control \nsystem:  each part is momentarily guided, rather than waiting for \n\"feedback.\" Where \nbefore, cellular \"regulatory mechanisms\" referred to certain \nfeedback mechanisms based on interactions of randomly diffusing molecules, \nthe new understanding of the cell sees a highly structured system in \nwhich very little is random, and the cell's adaptive possibilities, \ninstead of being limited to a certain number of genetic switches, are \nshaped by every imaginable environmental influence.  The cell's \nstructure, far from being \"read out of the genome,\" is sensitively \nreshaped constantly by processes that incorporate some of the environment \nin establishing each new stability.  The old-model-geneticists \nhave been forced to admit that the genes can't specify everything in \nthe organism's structure, and it was the brain's complexity that forced \nthis recognition that certain things are developed \"epigenetically.\"  \nBut the new fact that most biologists are reluctant to accept is that \nthe structure of the cell itself is developed very largely on the basis \nof information received from the environment--that is, \"epigenetically.\" Traditionally, \nepigenesis has meant that the form of an embryo or organism didn't preexist, \nor wasn't completely specified by the genes.  That is, it has had \nto do with the relationships between cells.  It involved a recognition \nthat \"cells are clever enough to design an organism.\"  \nIt is a significant step beyond that to the recognition that \"cells \nare clever enough to redesign themselves to meet situations never seen \nbefore. Biologists \nworking with bacteria and yeasts have seen them adapt in non-random \nways to novel conditions.  \"Directed mutations\" are impossible, \naccording to the \"central dogma\" that has the support of textbooks \nand most biology professors, but they do occur in those single-celled \norganisms.  Barbara McClintock showed that in corn her mobile genes \nwere mobilized by stress.  Although this isn't exactly \"directed \nmutation,\" it is an example of a mechanism for increasing adaptation \nwhen adaptation is need.  There is a certain type of enzyme which \nmakes specific cuts in the DNA chain.  Biotechnologists find them \nconvenient for their purposes, but their presence serves physiological \npurposes, presumably in all organisms, like those described by McClintock \nin corn.  During the terminal stress that produces the special \nkind of cell death known as apoptosis, these enzymes make confetti of \nthe genome. Poisons, \nsuch as estrogen, unsaturated fatty acids, or even radiation, produce \ndifferent effects at different doses.  Low doses typically stimulate \ncell division, larger doses produce changes of cell type and altered \nstates of differentiation, and finally, adequate doses produce apoptotic \ncell death.  There is a special ideology around apoptosis, which \nholds that it is \"genetically programmed,\" implying that whenever \nit occurs in the brain, it was destined to happen sooner or later.  \nBut in fact, \"growth factors\" of various sorts can prevent \nit.  It is increasingly clear that it represents excessive stress \nand deficient resources.  The involvement of the genetic apparatus \nin differentiation and radical adaptation suggests that the (epigenetic) \nresources of cells are unlimited. The \nchanges that are known to be produced by the poisons that we are habitually \nexposed to are exactly the changes that occur in the aging brain.  \nAs I scan over hundreds of studies that define the effects of estrogen, \nunsaturated fats, excess iron, and lipid peroxidation, my argument seems \ncommonplace, even trivial, except that I know that it clearly relates \nto therapies for most of the degenerative diseases, and that the great \nculture-machine is propagating a different view at several points that \nare essential for my argument. They \nare advancing a myth about human nature, so I will advance a counter-myth.  \nAt the time people were growing their large brains they lived in the \ntropics.  I suggest that in this time before the development of \ngrain-based agriculture, they ate a diet that was relatively free of \nunsaturated fats and low in iron--based on tropical fruits.  I \nsuggest that the Boskop skull from Mt. Kilimanjaro was representative \nof people under those conditions, and that just by our present knowledge \nof the association of brain size with longevity, they--as various \"Golden \nAge\" myths claim--must have had a very long life-span.  As \npeople moved north and developed new ways of living, their consumption \nof unsaturated fats increased, their brain size decreased, and they \naged rapidly.  Neanderthal relics show that flaxseed was a staple \nof their diet. Even \nliving in the tropics, there are many possibilities for diets rich in \nsignal-disrupting substances, including iron, and in high latitudes \nthere are opportunities for reducing our exposure to them.  As \na source of protein, milk is uniquely low in its iron content.  \nPotatoes, because of the high quality of their protein, are probably \nrelatively free of toxic signal-substances.  Many tropical fruits, \nbesides having relatively saturated fats, are also low in iron, and \noften contain important quantities of amino acids and proteins.  \nIn this context, Jeanne Calment's life-long, daily consumption of chocolate \ncomes to mind:  As she approaches her 121st birthday, she is still \neating chocolate, though she has stopped smoking and drinking wine.  \nThe saturated fats in chocolate have been found to block the toxicity \nof oils rich in linoleic acid, and its odd proteins seem to have an \nanabolic action. If \nwe really take seriously even the traditional sort of epigenesis, and \nespecially if we accept the deeper idea of epigenesis on the level of \ncellular structure and function, we have to see the organism as a sort \nof \"whirlwind of cells,\" made up of whirlwinds of atoms (in \nVernadsky's phrase) in which our way of life sets the boundaries within \nwhich our cells will restructure themselves. The \nrandom production of free radicals, rather than acting only by way of \ngenetic damage or protein cross-linking, is also able to act as a signalling \nprocess, that is, on a strictly physiological level.  An excess \nof unsaturated fatty acids itself constitutes a massive distortion of \nthe regulatory systems, but it also leads to distortions in the \"eicosanoid\" \nsystem and the increasingly uncontrolled production of free radicals, \nand to changes in energy, thyroid activity, and steroid balance.  \nThe aging body, rather than being like a car that needs more and more \nrepairs until it collapses from simple wear, is more like a car traveling \na road that becomes increasingly rough and muddy, until the road becomes \nan impassable swamp. The \nsuggested therapy is a correction of the signalling process, rather \nthan \"genetic surgery,\" transplantation, etc., which is the \npessimistic implication of the doctrine that oxidative damage is simply \na matter of \"wear and tear,\" \"somatic mutations,\" \n\nand \"cross-linking.\"  Those problems are reparable, and \nour emphasis should be on the production of energy and the avoidance \nof the conditions that allow the undesirable signals to accumulate. The \nabsence of cancer on a diet lacking unsaturated fats, the increased \nrate of metabolism, decreased free radical production, resistance to \nstress and poisoning by iron, alcohol, endotoxin, alloxan and streptozotocin, \netc., improvement of brain structure and function, decreased susceptibility \nto blood clots, and lack of obesity and age pigment on a diet using \ncoconut oil rather than unsaturated fats, indicates that something very \nsimple can be done to reduce the suffering from the major degenerative \ndiseases, and that it is very likely acting by reducing the aging process \nitself at its physiological core.

        "chunk_html": "Blocking Tissue DestructionThere \nalways seems to be a rough balance between tissue regeneration and tissue \ndegeneration, with growth and repair occurring when the equilibrium \nshifts in one direction,and with atrophy or degeneration occurring when \nthe balance shifts in the other direction.  If we can understand \nthe mechanisms of atrophy, and how to retard or to block tissue destruction, \nthen we can restore the balance to a degree which might allow regeneration \nto occur, even if we don't clearly understand the mechanisms of growth. Skin \nand bones are such different types of tissue that it will be useful \nto start with them, because if we can see similar processes of degeneration \nor regeneration in them, then the chances are good that the same processes \nwill occur in other tissues too.  Bone is a relatively stable tissue, \nwhile skin is a tissue whose cells divide rapidly. It \nis common medical knowledge that cortisone and realted glucocorticioid-type \nhormones cause skin to atrophy, becoming thinner.  Using topical \napplications of a synthetic derivative of cortisione,CM Papa and A M. \nKligman showed that the atrophy extended to the pigment cells,reducing \ntheirr size and eliminating most of their dendritic branches. Some animal \nstudies have found that estrogen caused the skin to become thinner.  \nThe other steroids they tested,progesterone, testosterone,and pregnenolone, \nacted in the opposite direction, making aged and atrophied skin thicker \nand more regular.  They also made the pigment cells larger, and \nincreased their branchinhg.l  Since these hormones were already \nknown to have protective actions against cortisone and estrogen, these \nresults were not too surprising, though they did directly contradict \nthe claims of people who made estrogen-containing cosmetics. Since \nprogesterone and pregnenolone do not cause healthy, young skin to thicken, \ntheir effect in damaged skin is probably partly to replace the deficiency \nof that type of steroid which occurs with aging, and to offset the damaging \neffects of the catabolic hormones, whose influence does not decrease \nwith age.  Many \nyears ago it was found that in old age a woman's estrogens were increasedd \nrelative to the 17-keto steroids adrenal androgens.  Later, it \nwas found that the conversion of androgen to estrogen increases with \nage in both men and women, and that this occurs largely in fat cells.  \nSeveral years ago, P. K. Siiteri found that low thyroid modified the \nenzymes of fat cells in a way that would tend to increase the conversion \nof androgen to estrogen.  More recently, it was found that adding \nprogesterone to the enzymes had the opposite effect of aging and hypothyroidism, \nprotecting the androgen from conversion to estrogen.  These researchers \n(C. J. Newton and colleagues, of London) concluded that the decreased \noutput of progesterone after the menopause might account for the increased \nproduction of estrogen.3  Since progesterone declines in aging \nmen, too, this could account for the same process in men. Vitamin \nA's effect on the skin opposes that of estrogen.4  There are several \nmechanisms that could account for this.  Vitamin A is used in the \nformation of steroids, and since the skin is a major site of steroid \nmetabolism, vitamin A might help to maintain the level of the anti-catabolic \nsteroids.  A deficiency of vitamin A causes excessive release of \nthe lysosomal enzymes, acid hydrolases, resulting in tissue catabolism.5  \nAlso, vitamin A is necessary for the proper differentiation of cells \nin skin and other membranes.  A deficiency tends to cause an increased \nrate of cell division, with the production of abnormal cells, and a \nsubstitution of keratinized cells for other types.  Estrogen also \npromotes keratinization and speeds cell division.  A deficiency \nof vitamin A can cause leukoplakia in the mouth and on the cervix of \nthe uterus; although this is considered \"pre-cancerous,\" I \nhave found it to be very easily reversible, as I have discussed elsewhere.6  \nI suspect that the intracellular fiber, keratin, is produced when a \ncell can't afford to do anything more complex.  Adequate vitamin \nA speeds protein synthesis,7 and allows it to be used more efficiently. Prolactin \n(which is promoted by estrogen, and inhibited by progesterone) increases \nwith stress and with age.  It probably affects every tissue, but \nit seems to have its greatest efects on the secretory membranes.  \nIt is known to have strong effects on the kidney, gut and skin (sweat \nand oil glands, hair follicles, and feathers inbirds), and on the gills \nof fish.  Its involvement with milk production suggests that it \nmight mobilize calcium from bones, and inf fact it does contribute to \nosteoporosis.  This was foreseen by G. Bourne, in his book on the \nmetabolism of hard tissues, when he suggested that estrogen, acting \nthrough the pituitary, might be expected to promote osteoporosis. Since \nreading Bourne's book, I have doubted that it was rational to use estrogen \nto prevent osteoporosis, especially when it is known to be carcinogenic \nand when the ratio of estrogen to and androgens and progesterone increases \nafter menopause.  Now that several publications have appeared clearly \nshowing that estrogen increases prolactin, that prolactin increases \nwith cancellous bone; adrenal androgens.  \nThyroid.  Rate of formation, overall metabolic rate. ARTHRITIS AND NATURAL HORMONES A \nvery healthy 71 year-old man was under his house repairing the foundation, \nwhen a support slipped and let the house fall far enough to break some \nfacial bones. During his recovery, he developed arthritis in his hands. \nIt is fairly common for arthritis to appear shortly after an accident, \na shock, or surgery, and Han Selye's famous work with rats shows that \nwhen stress exhausts the adrenal glands (so they are unable to produce \nnormal amounts of cortisone and related steroid hormones), arthritis \nand other \"degenerative\" diseases are likely to develop. But \nwhen this man went to his doctor to \"get something for his arthritis,\" \nhe was annoyed that the doctor insisted on giving him a complete physical \nexam, and wouldn't give him a shot of cortisone. The examination showed \nlow thyroid function, and the doctor prescribed a supplement of thyroid \nextract, explaining that arthritis is one of the many symptoms of hypothyroidism. \nThe patient agreed to take the thyroid, but for several days he grumbled \nabout the doctor 'fixing something that wasn't wrong' with him, and \nignoring his arthritis. But in less than two weeks, the arthritis had \nentirely disappeared. He lived to be 89, without a recurrence of arthritis. \n(He died iatrogenically, while in good health.) Selye's \nwork with the diseases of stress, and the anti-stress hormones of the \nadrenal cortex, helped many scientists to think more clearly about the \ninteraction of the organism with its environment, but it has led others \nto focus too narrowly on hormones of the adrenal cortex (such as cortisol \nand cortisone), and to forget the older knowledge about natural resistance. \nThere are probably only a few physicians now practicing who would remember \nto check for hypothyroidism in an arthritis patient, or in other stress-related \nconditions. Hypothyroidism is a common cause of adrenal insufficiency, \nbut it also has some direct effects on joint tissues. In chronic hypothyroidism \n(myxedema and cretinism), knees and elbows are often bent abnormally. By \nthe 1930's, it was well established that the resistance of the organism \ndepended on the energy produced by respiration under the influence of \nthe thyroid gland, as well as on the adrenal hormones, and that the \nhormones of pregnancy (especially progesterone) could substitute for \nthe adrenal hormones. In a sense, the thyroid hormone is the basic anti-stress \nhormone, since it is required for the production of the adrenal and \npregnancy hormones. A \ncontemporary researcher, F. Z. Meerson, is putting together a picture \nof the biological processes involved in adapting to stress, including \nenergy production, nutrition, hormones, and changes in cell structure. While \none of Selye's earliest observations related gastrointestinal bleeding \nto stress, Meerson's work has revealed in a detailed way how the usually \nbeneficial hormone of adaptation, cortisone, can cause so many other \nharmful effects when its action is too prolonged or too intense. Some \nof the harmful effects of the cortisone class of drugs (other than gastro-intestinal \nbleeding) are:  Hypertension, osteoporosis, delayed healing, atrophy \nof the skin, convulsions, cataracts, glaucoma, protruding eyes, psychic \nderangements, menstrual irregularities, and loss of immunity allowing \ninfections (or cancer) to spread. While \nnormal thyroid function is required for the secretion of the adrenal \nhormones, the basic signal which causes cortisone to be formed is a \ndrop in the blood glucose level. The increased energy requirement of \nany stress tends to cause the blood sugar to fall slightly, but hypothyroidism \nitself tends to depress blood sugar. The \nperson with low thyroid function is more likely than a normal person \nto require cortisone to cope with a certain amount of stress.  \nHowever, if large amounts of cortisone are produced for a long time, \nthe toxic effects of the hormone begin to appear. According to Meerson, \nheart attacks are provoked and aggravated by the cortisone produced \nduring stress. (Meerson and his colleagues have demonstrated that the \nprogress of a heart attack can be halted by a treatment including natural \nsubstances such as vitamin E and magnesium.) While \nhypothyroidism makes the body require more cortisone to sustain blood \nsugar and energy production, it also limits the ability to produce cortisone, \nso in some cases stress produces symptoms resulting from a deficiency \nof cortisone, including various forms of arthritis and more generalized \ntypes of chronic inflammation. Often, \na small physiological dose of natural hydrocortisone can help the patient \nmeet the stress, without causing harmful side-effects.  While treating \nthe symptoms with cortisone for a short time, it is important to try \nto learn the basic cause of the problem, by checking for hypothyroidism, \nvitamin A deficiency, protein deficiency, a lack of sunlight, etc. (I \nsuspect that light on the skin directly increases the skin's production \nof steroids, without depending on other organs.  Different steroids \nprobably involve different frequencies of light, but orange and red \nlight seem to be important frequencies.)  Using cortisone in this \nway, physiologically rather than pharmacologically, it is not likely \nto cause the serious problems mentioned above. Stress-induced \ncortisone deficiency is thought to be a factor in a great variety of \nunpleasant conditions, from allergies to ulcerative colitis, and in \nmany forms of arthritis.  The stress which can cause a cortisone \ndeficiency is even more likely to disturb formation of progesterone \nand thyroid hormone, so the fact that cortisone can relieve symptoms \ndoes not mean that it has corrected the problem. According \nto the Physicians' Desk Referenc, hormones similar to cortisone are \nuseful for treating rheumatoid arthritis, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, \nsynovitis of osteoarthritis, acute gouty arthritis, acute nonspecific \ntenosynovitis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, acute and \nsubacute bursitis, and epicondylitis. Although \ncortisone supplementation can help in a great variety of stress-related \ndiseases, no curewill take place unless the basic cause is discovered. \nBesides the thyroid, the other class of adaptive hormones which are \noften out of balance in the diseases of stress, is the group of hormones \nproduced mainly by the gonads: the \"reproductive hormones.\" \nDuring pregnancy these hormones serve to protect the developing baby \nfrom the stresses suffered by the mother, but the same hormones function \nas part to the protective anti-stress system in the non-pregnant individual, \nthough at a lower level. Some \nforms of arthritis are known to improve or even to disappear during \npregnancy. As mentioned above, the hormones of pregnancy can make up \nfor a lack of adrenal cortex hormones. During a healthy pregnancy, many \nhormones are present in increased amounts, including the thyroid hormones.  \nProgesterone, which is the most abundant hormone of pregnancy, has both \nanti-inflammatory and anesthetic actions, which would be of obvious \nbenefit in arthritis. There \nare other naturally anesthetic hormones which are increased during pregnancy, \nincluding DHEA, which is being studied for its anti-aging, anti-cancer, \nand anti-obesity effects. (One of the reasons that is frequently given \nfor the fact that this hormone hasn't been studied more widely is that, \nas a natural substance, it has not been monopolized by a drug patent, \nand so no drug company has been willing to invest money in studying \nits medical uses.) These hormones also have the ability to control cell \ndivision, which would be important in forms of arthritis that involve \ninvasive tissue growth. While \nthese substances, so abundant in pregnancy, have the ability to substitute \nfor cortisone, they can also be used by the adrenal glands to produce \ncortisol and related hormones. But probably the most surprising property \nof these natural steroids is that they protect against the toxic side-effects \nof excessive adrenal hormones. And they seem to have no side-effects \nof their own; after about fifty years of medical use, no toxic side \neffects have been found for progesterone or pregnenolone. Pregnenolone \nis the material the body uses to form either progesterone or DHEA. Others, \nincluding DHEA, haven't been studied for so long, but the high levels \nwhich are normally present in healthy people would suggest that replacement \ndoses, to restore those normal levels, would not be likely to produce \ntoxic side effects. And, considering the terrible side effects of the \ndrugs that are now widely used, these drugs would be justifiable simply \nto prevent some of the toxic effects of conventional \ntreatment. It \ntakes a new way of thinking to understand that these protective substances \nprotect against an excess of the adrenal steroids, as well as making \nup for a deficiency. Several of these natural hormones also have a protective \naction against various poisons; Selye called this their \"catatoxic\" \neffect. Besides \nmany people whose arthritis improved with only thyroid supplementation, \nI have seen 30 people use one or more of these other natural hormones \nfor various types of arthritis, usually with a topical application. \nOften the pain is relieved within a few minutes. I know of several other \npeople who used progesterone topically for inflamed tendons, damaged \ncartilage, or other inflammations. Only one of these, a woman with rheumatoid \narthritis in many joints, had no significant improvement. An hour after \nshe had applied it to her hands and feet, she enthusiastically reported \nthat her ankle had stopped hurting, but after this she said she had no noticeable improvement. We \noften hear that \"there is no cure for arthritis, because the causes \nare not known.\" If the cause is an imbalance in the normal hormones \nof adaptation and resistance, then eliminating the cause by restoring \nbalance will produce a true cure.  But if it is more profitable \nto sell powerful drugs than to sell the nutrients needed to form natural \nhormones (or to supplement those natural hormones) we can't expect the \ndrug companies to spend any money investigating that sort of cure. And \nat present the arthritis market amounts to billions of dollars in drug \nsales each year. © Ray Peat 2006. All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com",

        "chunk_html": "Caffeine: A vitamin-like nutrient, or adaptogenQuestions about tea and coffee, cancer and other degenerative diseases, and the hormones.There \nis a popular health-culture that circulates mistaken ideas about nutrition, \nand coffee drinking has been a perennial target of this culture.  \nIt is commonly said that coffee is a drug, not a food, and that its \ndrug action is harmful, and that this harm is not compensated by any \nnutritional benefit.  Most physicians subscribe to most of these \ncommon sense ideas about coffee, and form an authoritative barrier \nagainst the assimilation of scientific information about coffee.I \nthink it would be good to reconsider coffees place in the diet and \nin health care.Coffee \ndrinkers have a lower incidence of thyroid disease, including cancer, \nthannon-drinkers.Caffeine \nprotects the liver from alcohol and acetaminophen (Tylenol) and other \ntoxins, and coffee drinkers are less likely than people who dont \nuse coffee to have elevated serum enzymes and other indications of liver \ndamage.Caffeine \nprotects against cancer caused by radiation, chemical carcinogens, viruses, \nand estrogens.Caffeine \nsynergizes with progesterone, and increases its concentration in blood \nand tissues.Cystic \nbreast disease is not caused by caffeine, in fact caffeines effects \nare likely to be protective; a variety of studies show that coffee, \ntea, and caffeine are protective against breast cancer.Coffee \nprovides very significant quantities of magnesium, as well as other \nnutrients including vitamin B1.Caffeine \nimproves efficiency of fuel use and performance: \nJC Wagner 1989.Coffee \ndrinkers have a low incidence of suicide.Caffeine \nsupports serotonin uptake in nerves, and inhibits blood platelet aggregation.Coffee \ndrinkers have been found to have lower cadmium in tissues; coffee making \nremoves heavy metals from water.Coffee \ninhibits iron absorption if taken with meals, helping to prevent iron \noverload.Caffeine, \nlike niacin, inhibits apoptosis, protecting against stress-induced cell \ndeath, without interfering with normal cell turnover.Caffeine \ncan prevent nerve cell death.Coffee \n(or caffeine) prevents Parkinsons Disease \n(Ross, et al., 2000).The \nprenatal growth retardation that can be caused by feeding large amounts \nof caffeine is prevented by supplementing the diet with sugar.Caffeine \nstops production of free radicals by inhibiting \nxanthine oxidase, an important factor in tissue stress.Caffeine \nlowers serum potassium following exercise; stabilizes platelets, reducing \nthromboxane production.One \ndefinition of a vitamin is that it is an organic chemical found in foods, \nthe lack of whichcausesa specificdisease,or group of diseases.  A variety of substances that have been proposed \nto be vitamins havent been recognized as being essential, and some \nsubstances that arent essential are sometimes called vitamins.  \nSometimes these issues havent had enough scientific investigation, \nbut often nonscientific forces regulate nutritional ideas.The \ndefinition of a disease isnt as clear as text-book writers \nhave implied, and causality in biology is always more complex \nthan we like to believe.Nutrition \nis one of the most important sciences, and should certainly be as prestigious \nand well financed as astrophysics and nuclear physics, but while people \nsay it doesnt take a brain surgeon to figure that out, no one \nsays it doesnt take a nutritionist to understand that.  \nPartly, thats because medicine treated scientific nutrition as an \nillegitimate step-child, and refused throughout the 20th century to \nrecognize that it is a central part of scientific health care.  \nIn the 1970s, physicians and dietitians were still ridiculing the idea \nthat vitamin E could prevent or cure diseases of the circulatory system, \nand babies as well as older people were given total intravenous nutrition \nwhich lacked nutrients that are essential to life, growth, immunity, \nand healing.  Medicine and science are powerfully institutionalized, \nbut no institution or profession has existed for the purpose of encouraging \npeople to act reasonably.In \nthis environment, most people have felt that subtleties of definition, \nlogic and evidence werent important for nutrition, and a great amount \nof energy has gone into deciding whether there were four food groups \nor seven food groups or a nutritional pyramid.  The \nmotives behind governmental and quasi-governmental nutrition policies \nusually represent something besides a simple scientific concern for \ngood health, as when health care institutions say that Mexican babies \nshould begin eating beans when they reach the age of six months, or \nthat non-whites dont need milk after they are weaned.  In a \nculture that discourages prolonged breast feeding, the effects of these \ndoctrines can be serious.After \na century of scientific nutrition, public nutritional policies are doing \napproximately as much harm as good, and they are getting worse faster \nthan they are getting better..In \nthis culture, what we desperately need is a recognition of the complexity \nof life, and of the political-ecological situation we find ourselves \nin. Any thinking which isnt system thinking should be treated \nwith caution, and most contemporary thinking about health neglects to \nconsider relevant parts of the problem-system.  Official \nrecommendations about salt, cholesterol, iron, unsaturated and saturated \nfats, and soybeans have generally been inappropriate, unscientific, \nand strongly motivated by business interests rather than by biological \nknowledge.Definitions \nhave rarely distinguished clearly between nutrients and drugs, and new \ncommercial motives are helping to further blur the distinctions.Essential \nnutrients, defensive (detoxifying, \nantistress) nutrients, hormone-modulating nutrients, self-actualization \nnutrients, growth regulating nutrients, structure modifiers, life extension \nagents, transgenerationally active (imprinting)nutrients--the \nline between nutrients and biological modifiers often depends on the \nsituation. Vitamins D and A clearly have hormone-like properties, and \nvitamin Es effects, and those of many terpenoids and steroids and \nbioflavonoids found in foods, include hormone-like actions as well as \nantioxidant and pro-oxidant functions.  The concept of adaptogen \ncan include things that act like both drugs and nutrients.Some \nstudies have suggested that trace amounts of nutrients could be passed \non for a few generations, but the evidence now indicates that these \ntransgenerational effects are caused by phenomena such as imprinting.  \nBut the hereditary effects of nutrients are so complex that their recognition \nwould force nutrition to be recognized as one of the most complex sciences, \ninterwoven with the complexities of growth and development.The \nidea that poor nutrition stunts growth has led to the idea that good \nnutrition can be defined in terms of the rate of growth and the size \nultimately reached.  In medicine, it is common to refer to an obese \nspecimen as well nourished, as if quantity of food and quantity \nof tissue were necessarily good things.  But poisons can stimulate \ngrowth (hormesis), \nand food restriction can extend longevity.We still have to \ndetermine basic things such as the optimal rate of growth, and the optimal \nsize.Nutrition \ntextbooks flatly describe caffeine as a drug, not a nutrient, as if \nit were obvious that nutrients cant be drugs.  Any of the essential \nnutrients, if used in isolation, can be used as a drug, for a specific \neffect on the organism that it wouldnt normally have when eaten as \na component of ordinary food.  And natural foods contain thousands \nof chemicals, other than the essential nutrients.  Many of these \nare called nonessential nutrients, but their importance is being recognized \nincreasingly.  The truth is that we arent sure what they arent \nessential for.  Until we have more definite knowledge about \nthe organism I dont think we should categorize things so absolutely \nas drugs or nutrients.The \nbad effects ascribed to coffee usually involve administering large doses \nin a short period of time.  While caffeine is commonly said to \nraise blood pressure, this effect is slight, and may not occur during \nthe normal use of coffee.  Experimenters typically ignore essential \nfactors.  Drinking plain water can cause an extreme rise in blood \npressure, especially in old people, and eating a meal (containing carbohydrate) \nlowers blood pressure.  The increased metabolic rate caffeine produces \nincreases the cellular consumption of glucose, so experiments that study \nthe effects of coffee taken on an empty stomach are measuring the effects \nof increased temperature and metabolic rate, combined with increased \nadrenaline (resulting from the decrease of glucose), and so confuse \nthe issue of caffeines intrinsic effects.In \none study (Krasilnikov, 1975), the drugs were introduced directly \ninto the carotid artery to study the effects on the blood vessels in \nthe brain.  Caffeine increased the blood volume in the brain, while \ndecreasing the resistance of the vessels, and this effect is what would \nbe expected from its stimulation of brain metabolism and the consequent \nincrease in carbon dioxide, which dilates blood vessels.In \nthe whole body, increased carbon dioxide also decreases vascular resistance, \nand this allows circulation to increase, while the hearts work is \ndecreased, relative to the amount of blood pumped.  But when the \nwhole bodys metabolism is increased, adequate nutrition is crucial.In \nanimal experiments that have been used to argue that pregnant women \nshouldnt drink coffee, large doses of caffeine given to pregnant \nanimals retarded the growth of the fetuses.  But simply giving \nmore sucrose prevented the growth retardation.  Since caffeine \ntends to correct some of the metabolic problems that could interfere \nwith pregnancy, it is possible that rationally constructed experiments \ncould show benefits to the fetus from the mothers use of coffee, \nfor example by lowering bilirubin and serotonin, preventing hypoglycemia, \nincreasing uterine perfusion and progesterone synthesis, synergizing \nwith thyroid and cortisol to promote lung maturation, and providing \nadditional nutrients.One \nof the most popular misconceptions about caffeine is that it causes \nfibrocystic breast disease.  Several groups demonstrated pretty \nclearly that it doesnt, but there was no reason that they should \nhave had to bother, except for an amazingly incompetent, but highly \npublicized, series of articles--classics of their kind--by J. P. Minton, \nof Ohio State University.  Minton neglected to notice that the \nhealthy breast contains a high percentage of fat, and that the inflamed \nand diseased breast has an increased proportion of glandular material  \nFat cells have a low level of cyclic AMP, a regulatory substance that \nis associated with normal cellular differentiation and function, and \nis involved in mediating caffeines ability to inhibit cancer cell \nmultiplication.  Mintonargued that cAMP increases progressively with the degree of breast disease, \nup to cancer, and that cAMP is increased by caffeine.  A variety \nof substances other than caffeine that inhibit the growth of cancer \ncells (as well as normal breast cells) act byincreasingthe \namount of cyclic AMP, while estrogen lowers the amount of cAMP and increases \ncell growth.  Mintons argument should have been to use more \ncaffeine, in proportion to the degree of breast disease, if he were \narguing logically from his evidence.  Caffeines effect on the \nbreast resembles that of progesterone, opposing estrogens effects.Many \nstudies over the last 30 years have shown caffeine to be highly protective \nagainst all kinds of carcinogenesis, including estrogens carcinogenic \neffects on the breast.  Caffeine is now being used along with some \nof the standard cancer treatments, to improve their effects or to reduce \ntheir side effects.  There are substances in the coffee berry besides \ncaffeine that protect against mutations and cancer, and that have shown \nstrong therapeutic effects against cancer.  Although many plant \nsubstances are protective against mutations and cancer, I dont know \nof any that is as free of side effects as coffee.To \ntalk about caffeine, its necessary to talk about uric acid.Uric acid, synthesized in the body, is both a stimulant and a very important \nantioxidant, and its structure is very similar to that of caffeine.A deficiency of uric acid is a serious problem.  Caffeine and uric \nacid are in the group of chemicals called purines.Purines \n(along with pyrimidines) are components of the nucleic acids, DNA and \nRNA, but they have many other functions.  In general, substances \nrelated to purines are stimulants, and substances related to pyrimidines \nare sedatives.When \nthe basic purine structure is oxidized, it becomes in turn hypoxanthine, \nxanthine, and uric acid, by the addition of oxygen atoms.  When \nmethyl groups (CH3) are added to nitrogens in the purine \nring, the molecule becomes less water soluble.  Xanthine (an intermediate \nin purine metabolism) has two oxygen atoms, and when three methyl groups \nare added, it becomes trimethyl xanthine, or caffeine.  With two \nmethyl groups, it is theophylline,which is named for its presence in tea.  We have enzyme systems \nwhich can add and subtract methyl groups;for example, when babies \nare given theophylline, they can convert it into caffeine.We \nhave enzymes that can modify all of the methyl groups and oxygen atoms \nof caffeine and the other purine derivatives.  Caffeine is usually \nexcreted in a modified form, for example as a methylated uric acid.One \nof the ways in which uric acid functions as an antioxidant is \nby modifying the activity of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which in stress \ncan become a dangerous source of free radicals.  Caffeine also \nrestrains this enzyme.  There are several other ways in which uric \nacid and caffeine (and a variety of intermediate xanthines) protect \nagainst oxidative damage.  Coffee drinkers, for example, have been \nfound to have lower levels of cadmium in their kidneys than people who \ndont use coffee, and coffee is known to inhibit the absorption of \niron by the intestine, helping to prevent iron overload.Toxins \nand stressors often kill cells, for example in the brain, liver, and \nimmune system, by causing the cells to expend energy faster than it \ncan be replaced.  There is an enzyme system that repairs genetic \ndamage, called PARP.  The activation of this enzyme is a \nmajor energy drain, and substances that inhibit it can prevent the death \nof the cell.  Niacin and caffeine can inhibit this enzyme sufficiently \nto prevent this characteristic kind of cell death, without preventing \nthe normal cellular turnover;that is, they dont produce tumors \nby preventing the death of cells that arent needed.The \npurines are important in a great variety of regulatory processes, and \ncaffeine fits into this complex system in other ways that are often \nprotective against stress.  For example, it has been proposed that \ntea can protect against circulatory disease by preventing abnormal clotting, \nand the mechanism seems to be that caffeine (or theophylline) tends \nto restrain stress-induced platelet aggregaton.When \nplatelets clump, they release various factors that contribute to the \ndevelopment of a clot.  Serotonin is one of these, and is released \nby other kinds of cell, including mast cells and basophils and nerve \ncells.  Serotonin produces vascular spasms and increased blood \npressure, blood vessel leakiness and inflammation, and the release of \nmany other stress mediators.  Caffeine, besides inhibiting the \nplatelet aggregation, also tends to inhibit the release of serotonin, \nor to promote its uptake and binding.J. \nW. Davis, et al., 1996, found that high uric acid levels seem to protect \nagainst the development of Parkinsons disease.  They ascribed \nthis effect to uric acids antioxidant function.  Coffee drinking, \nwhichlowersuric acid levels, nevertheless appeared to be much \nmore strongly protective against Parkinsons disease than uric acid.Possibly \nmore important than coffees ability to protect the health is the \nway it does it.  The studies that have tried to gather evidence \nto show that coffee is harmful, and found the opposite, have provided \ninsight into several diseases.  For example, coffees effects \non serotonin are very similar to carbon dioxides, and the thyroid \nhormones.  Noticing that coffee drinking is associated with \na low incidence of Parkinsons disease could focus attention on the \nways that thyroid and carbon dioxide and serotonin, estrogen, mast cells, \nhistamine and blood clotting interact to produce nerve cell death.Thinking \nabout how caffeine can be beneficial across such a broad spectrum of \nproblems can give us a perspective on the similarities of their underlying \nphysiology and biochemistry, expanding the implications of stress, biological \nenergy, and adaptability.The \nobservation that coffee drinkers have a low incidence of suicide, for \nexample, might be physiologically related to the large increase in suicide \nrate among people who use the newer antidepressants called serotonin \nreuptake inhibitors.  Serotonin excess causes several of the \nfeatures of depression, such as learned helplessness and reduced metabolic \nrate, while coffee stimulates theuptake(inactivation or storage) \nof serotonin, increases metabolic energy, and tends to improve mood.  \nIn animal studies, it reverses the state of helplessness or despair, \noften more effectively than so-called antidepressants.The \nresearch on caffeines effects on blood pressure, and on the use of \nfuel by the more actively metabolizing cells, hasnt clarified its \neffects on respiration and nutrition, but some of these experiments \nconfirm things that coffee drinkers usually learn for themselves.Often, \na woman who thinks that she has symptoms of hypoglycemia says that drinking \neven the smallest amount of coffee makes her anxious and shaky.  \nSometimes, I have suggested that they try drinking about two ounces \nof coffee with cream or milk along with a meal.  Its common \nfor them to find that this reduces their symptoms of hypoglycemia, and \nallows them to be symptom-free between meals.  Although we dont \nknow exactly why caffeine improves an athletes endurance, I think \nthe same processes are involved when coffee increases a persons endurance \nin ordinary activities.Caffeine \nhas remarkable parallels to thyroid and progesterone, and the use of \ncoffee or tea can help to maintain their production, or compensate for \ntheir deficiency.  Women spontaneously drink more coffee premenstrually, \nand since caffeine is known to increase the concentration of progesterone \nin the blood and in the brain, this is obviously a spontaneous and rational \nform of self-medication, though medical editors like to see things causally \nreversed, and blame the coffee drinking for the symptoms it is actually \nalleviating.  Some women have noticed that the effect of a progesterone \nsupplement is stronger when they take it with coffee.  This is \nsimilar to the synergy between thyroid and progesterone, which is probably \ninvolved, since caffeine tends tolocallyactivate thyroid secretion \nby a variety of mechanisms, increasing cyclic AMP and decreasing serotonin \nin thyroid cells, for example, \nand also by lowering the systemic stress mediators.Medical \neditors like to publish articles that reinforce important prejudices, \neven if, scientifically, they are trash.  The momentum of a bad \nidea can probably be measured by the tons of glossy paper that have \ngone into its development.  Just for the sake of the environment, \nit would be nice if editors would try to think in terms of evidence \nand biological mechanisms, rather than stereotypes.REFERENCESFiziol \nZh SSSR Im I M Sechenova 1975 Oct;61(10):1531-8.[Changes in the \nresistance and capacity of the cerebral vascular bed under the influence \nof vasoactive substances].[Article in Russian] Krasil'nikov, V.G. \nEffects of intracarotid injections of vasoactive agents on cerebrovascular \nresistance (CVR) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were studied in hemodynamically \nisolated brain of cats.

All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com There \nis a popular health-culture that circulates mistaken ideas about nutrition, \nand coffee drinking has been a perennial target of this culture.  \nIt is commonly said that coffee is a drug, not a food, and that its \ndrug action is harmful, and that this harm is not compensated by any \nnutritional benefit.  Most physicians subscribe to most of these \ncommon sense ideas about coffee, and form an authoritative barrier \nagainst the assimilation of scientific information about coffee. I \nthink it would be good to reconsider coffees place in the diet and \nin health care. Coffee \ndrinkers have a lower incidence of thyroid disease, including cancer, \nthannon-drinkers. Caffeine \nprotects the liver from alcohol and acetaminophen (Tylenol) and other \ntoxins, and coffee drinkers are less likely than people who dont \nuse coffee to have elevated serum enzymes and other indications of liver \ndamage. Caffeine \nprotects against cancer caused by radiation, chemical carcinogens, viruses, \nand estrogens. Caffeine \nsynergizes with progesterone, and increases its concentration in blood \nand tissues. Cystic \nbreast disease is not caused by caffeine, in fact caffeines effects \nare likely to be protective; a variety of studies show that coffee, \ntea, and caffeine are protective against breast cancer. Coffee \nprovides very significant quantities of magnesium, as well as other \nnutrients including vitamin B1. Caffeine \nimproves efficiency of fuel use and performance: \nJC Wagner 1989. Coffee \ndrinkers have a low incidence of suicide. Caffeine \nsupports serotonin uptake in nerves, and inhibits blood platelet aggregation. Coffee \ndrinkers have been found to have lower cadmium in tissues; coffee making \nremoves heavy metals from water. Coffee \ninhibits iron absorption if taken with meals, helping to prevent iron \noverload. Caffeine, \nlike niacin, inhibits apoptosis, protecting against stress-induced cell \ndeath, without interfering with normal cell turnover. Caffeine \ncan prevent nerve cell death. Coffee \n(or caffeine) prevents Parkinsons Disease \n(Ross, et al., 2000). The \nprenatal growth retardation that can be caused by feeding large amounts \nof caffeine is prevented by supplementing the diet with sugar. Caffeine \nstops production of free radicals by inhibiting \nxanthine oxidase, an important factor in tissue stress. Caffeine \nlowers serum potassium following exercise; stabilizes platelets, reducing \nthromboxane production. One \ndefinition of a vitamin is that it is an organic chemical found in foods, \nthe lack of whichcausesa specificdisease,or group of diseases.  A variety of substances that have been proposed \nto be vitamins havent been recognized as being essential, and some \nsubstances that arent essential are sometimes called vitamins.  \nSometimes these issues havent had enough scientific investigation, \nbut often nonscientific forces regulate nutritional ideas. The \ndefinition of a disease isnt as clear as text-book writers \nhave implied, and causality in biology is always more complex \nthan we like to believe. Nutrition \nis one of the most important sciences, and should certainly be as prestigious \nand well financed as astrophysics and nuclear physics, but while people \nsay it doesnt take a brain surgeon to figure that out, no one \nsays it doesnt take a nutritionist to understand that.  \nPartly, thats because medicine treated scientific nutrition as an \nillegitimate step-child, and refused throughout the 20th century to \nrecognize that it is a central part of scientific health care.  \nIn the 1970s, physicians and dietitians were still ridiculing the idea \nthat vitamin E could prevent or cure diseases of the circulatory system, \nand babies as well as older people were given total intravenous nutrition \nwhich lacked nutrients that are essential to life, growth, immunity, \nand healing.  Medicine and science are powerfully institutionalized, \nbut no institution or profession has existed for the purpose of encouraging \npeople to act reasonably. In \nthis environment, most people have felt that subtleties of definition, \nlogic and evidence werent important for nutrition, and a great amount \nof energy has gone into deciding whether there were four food groups \nor seven food groups or a nutritional pyramid.  The \nmotives behind governmental and quasi-governmental nutrition policies \nusually represent something besides a simple scientific concern for \ngood health, as when health care institutions say that Mexican babies \nshould begin eating beans when they reach the age of six months, or \nthat non-whites dont need milk after they are weaned.  In a \nculture that discourages prolonged breast feeding, the effects of these \ndoctrines can be serious. After \na century of scientific nutrition, public nutritional policies are doing \napproximately as much harm as good, and they are getting worse faster \nthan they are getting better.. In \nthis culture, what we desperately need is a recognition of the complexity \nof life, and of the political-ecological situation we find ourselves \nin. Any thinking which isnt system thinking should be treated \nwith caution, and most contemporary thinking about health neglects to \nconsider relevant parts of the problem-system.  Official \nrecommendations about salt, cholesterol, iron, unsaturated and saturated \nfats, and soybeans have generally been inappropriate, unscientific, \nand strongly motivated by business interests rather than by biological \nknowledge. Definitions \nhave rarely distinguished clearly between nutrients and drugs, and new \ncommercial motives are helping to further blur the distinctions. Essential \nnutrients, defensive (detoxifying, \nantistress) nutrients, hormone-modulating nutrients, self-actualization \nnutrients, growth regulating nutrients, structure modifiers, life extension \nagents, transgenerationally active (imprinting)nutrients--the \nline between nutrients and biological modifiers often depends on the \nsituation. Vitamins D and A clearly have hormone-like properties, and \nvitamin Es effects, and those of many terpenoids and steroids and \nbioflavonoids found in foods, include hormone-like actions as well as \nantioxidant and pro-oxidant functions.  The concept of adaptogen \ncan include things that act like both drugs and nutrients. Some \nstudies have suggested that trace amounts of nutrients could be passed \non for a few generations, but the evidence now indicates that these \ntransgenerational effects are caused by phenomena such as imprinting.  \nBut the hereditary effects of nutrients are so complex that their recognition \nwould force nutrition to be recognized as one of the most complex sciences, \ninterwoven with the complexities of growth and development. The \nidea that poor nutrition stunts growth has led to the idea that good \nnutrition can be defined in terms of the rate of growth and the size \nultimately reached.  In medicine, it is common to refer to an obese \nspecimen as well nourished, as if quantity of food and quantity \nof tissue were necessarily good things.  But poisons can stimulate \ngrowth (hormes is), \nand food restriction can extend longevity.We still have to \ndetermine basic things such as the optimal rate of growth, and the optimal \nsize. Nutrition \ntextbooks flatly describe caffeine as a drug, not a nutrient, as if \nit were obvious that nutrients cant be drugs.  Any of the essential \nnutrients, if used in isolation, can be used as a drug, for a specific \neffect on the organism that it wouldnt normally have when eaten as \na component of ordinary food.  And natural foods contain thousands \nof chemicals, other than the essential nutrients.  Many of these \nare called nonessential nutrients, but their importance is being recognized \nincreasingly.  The truth is that we arent sure what they arent \nessential for.  Until we have more definite knowledge about \nthe organism I dont think we should categorize things so absolutely \nas drugs or nutrients. The \nbad effects ascribed to coffee usually involve administering large doses \nin a short period of time.  While caffeine is commonly said to \nraise blood pressure, this effect is slight, and may not occur during \nthe normal use of coffee.  Experimenters typically ignore essential \nfactors.  Drinking plain water can cause an extreme rise in blood \npressure, especially in old people, and eating a meal (containing carbohydrate) \nlowers blood pressure.  The increased metabolic rate caffeine produces \nincreases the cellular consumption of glucose, so experiments that study \nthe effects of coffee taken on an empty stomach are measuring the effects \nof increased temperature and metabolic rate, combined with increased \nadrenaline (resulting from the decrease of glucose), and so confuse \nthe issue of caffeines intrinsic effects. In \none study (Krasilnikov, 1975), the drugs were introduced directly \ninto the carotid artery to study the effects on the blood vessels in \nthe brain.  Caffeine increased the blood volume in the brain, while \ndecreasing the resistance of the vessels, and this effect is what would \nbe expected from its stimulation of brain metabolism and the consequent \nincrease in carbon dioxide, which dilates blood vessels. In \nthe whole body, increased carbon dioxide also decreases vascular resistance, \nand this allows circulation to increase, while the hearts work is \ndecreased, relative to the amount of blood pumped.  But when the \nwhole bodys metabolism is increased, adequate nutrition is crucial. In \nanimal experiments that have been used to argue that pregnant women \nshouldnt drink coffee, large doses of caffeine given to pregnant \nanimals retarded the growth of the fetuses.  But simply giving \nmore sucrose prevented the growth retardation.  Since caffeine \ntends to correct some of the metabolic problems that could interfere \nwith pregnancy, it is possible that rationally constructed experiments \ncould show benefits to the fetus from the mothers use of coffee, \nfor example by lowering bilirubin and serotonin, preventing hypoglycemia, \nincreasing uterine perfusion and progesterone synthesis, synergizing \nwith thyroid and cortisol to promote lung maturation, and providing \nadditional nutrients. One \nof the most popular misconceptions about caffeine is that it causes \nfibrocystic breast disease.  Several groups demonstrated pretty \nclearly that it doesnt, but there was no reason that they should \nhave had to bother, except for an amazingly incompetent, but highly \npublicized, series of articles--classics of their kind--by J. P. Minton, \nof Ohio State University.  Minton neglected to notice that the \nhealthy breast contains a high percentage of fat, and that the inflamed \nand diseased breast has an increased proportion of glandular material  \nFat cells have a low level of cyclic AMP, a regulatory substance that \nis associated with normal cellular differentiation and function, and \nis involved in mediating caffeines ability to inhibit cancer cell \nmultiplication.  Minton argued that cAMP increases progressively with the degree of breast disease, \nup to cancer, and that cAMP is increased by caffeine.  A variety \nof substances other than caffeine that inhibit the growth of cancer \ncells (as well as normal breast cells) act byincreasingthe \namount of cyclic AMP, while estrogen lowers the amount of cAMP and increases \ncell growth.  Mintons argument should have been to use more \ncaffeine, in proportion to the degree of breast disease, if he were \narguing logically from his evidence.  Caffeines effect on the \nbreast resembles that of progesterone, opposing estrogens effects. Many \nstudies over the last 30 years have shown caffeine to be highly protective \nagainst all kinds of carcinogenesis, including estrogens carcinogenic \neffects on the breast.  Caffeine is now being used along with some \nof the standard cancer treatments, to improve their effects or to reduce \ntheir side effects.  There are substances in the coffee berry besides \ncaffeine that protect against mutations and cancer, and that have shown \nstrong therapeutic effects against cancer.  Although many plant \nsubstances are protective against mutations and cancer, I dont know \nof any that is as free of side effects as coffee. To \ntalk about caffeine, its necessary to talk about uric acid.Uric acid, synthesized in the body, is both a stimulant and a very important \nantioxidant, and its structure is very similar to that of caffeine.A deficiency of uric acid is a serious problem.  Caffeine and uric \nacid are in the group of chemicals called purines. Purines \n(along with pyrimidines) are components of the nucleic acids, DNA and \nRNA, but they have many other functions.  In general, substances \nrelated to purines are stimulants, and substances related to pyrimidines \nare sedatives. When \nthe basic purine structure is oxidized, it becomes in turn hypoxanthine, \nxanthine, and uric acid, by the addition of oxygen atoms.  When \nmethyl groups (CH3) are added to nitrogens in the purine \nring, the molecule becomes less water soluble.  Xanthine (an intermediate \nin purine metabolism) has two oxygen atoms, and when three methyl groups \nare added, it becomes trimethyl xanthine, or caffeine.  With two \nmethyl groups, it is theophylline, which is named for its presence in tea.  We have enzyme systems \nwhich can add and subtract methyl groups;for example, when babies \nare given theophylline, they can convert it into caffeine. We \nhave enzymes that can modify all of the methyl groups and oxygen atoms \nof caffeine and the other purine derivatives.  Caffeine is usually \nexcreted in a modified form, for example as a methylated uric acid. One \nof the ways in which uric acid functions as an antioxidant is \nby modifying the activity of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which in stress \ncan become a dangerous source of free radicals.  Caffeine also \nrestrains this enzyme.  There are several other ways in which uric \nacid and caffeine (and a variety of intermediate xanthines) protect \nagainst oxidative damage.  Coffee drinkers, for example, have been \nfound to have lower levels of cadmium in their kidneys than people who \ndont use coffee, and coffee is known to inhibit the absorption of \niron by the intestine, helping to prevent iron overload. Toxins \nand stressors often kill cells, for example in the brain, liver, and \nimmune system, by causing the cells to expend energy faster than it \ncan be replaced.  There is an enzyme system that repairs genetic \ndamage, called PARP.  The activation of this enzyme is a \nmajor energy drain, and substances that inhibit it can prevent the death \nof the cell.  Niacin and caffeine can inhibit this enzyme sufficiently \nto prevent this characteristic kind of cell death, without preventing \nthe normal cellular turnover;that is, they dont produce tumors \nby preventing the death of cells that arent needed. The \npurines are important in a great variety of regulatory processes, and \ncaffeine fits into this complex system in other ways that are often \nprotective against stress.  For example, it has been proposed that \ntea can protect against circulatory disease by preventing abnormal clotting, \nand the mechanism seems to be that caffeine (or theophylline) tends \nto restrain stress-induced platelet aggregaton. When \nplatelets clump, they release various factors that contribute to the \ndevelopment of a clot.  Serotonin is one of these, and is released \nby other kinds of cell, including mast cells and basophils and nerve \ncells.  Serotonin produces vascular spasms and increased blood \npressure, blood vessel leakiness and inflammation, and the release of \nmany other stress mediators.  Caffeine, besides inhibiting the \nplatelet aggregation, also tends to inhibit the release of serotonin, \nor to promote its uptake and binding. J. \nW. Davis, et al., 1996, found that high uric acid levels seem to protect \nagainst the development of Parkinsons disease.  They ascribed \nthis effect to uric acids antioxidant function.  Coffee drinking, \nwhichlowersuric acid levels, nevertheless appeared to be much \nmore strongly protective against Parkinsons disease than uric acid. Possibly \nmore important than coffees ability to protect the health is the \nway it does it.  The studies that have tried to gather evidence \nto show that coffee is harmful, and found the opposite, have provided \ninsight into several diseases.  For example, coffees effects \non serotonin are very similar to carbon dioxides, and the thyroid \nhormones.  Noticing that coffee drinking is associated with \na low incidence of Parkinsons disease could focus attention on the \nways that thyroid and carbon dioxide and serotonin, estrogen, mast cells, \nhistamine and blood clotting interact to produce nerve cell death. Thinking \nabout how caffeine can be beneficial across such a broad spectrum of \nproblems can give us a perspective on the similarities of their underlying \nphysiology and biochemistry, expanding the implications of stress, biological \nenergy, and adaptability. The \nobservation that coffee drinkers have a low incidence of suicide, for \nexample, might be physiologically related to the large increase in suicide \nrate among people who use the newer antidepressants called serotonin \nreuptake inhibitors.  Serotonin excess causes several of the \nfeatures of depression, such as learned helplessness and reduced metabolic \nrate, while coffee stimulates theuptake(inactivation or storage) \nof serotonin, increases metabolic energy, and tends to improve mood.  \nIn animal studies, it reverses the state of helplessness or despair, \noften more effectively than so-called antidepressants. The \nresearch on caffeines effects on blood pressure, and on the use of \nfuel by the more actively metabolizing cells, hasnt clarified its \neffects on respiration and nutrition, but some of these experiments \nconfirm things that coffee drinkers usually learn for themselves. Often, \na woman who thinks that she has symptoms of hypoglycemia says that drinking \neven the smallest amount of coffee makes her anxious and shaky.  \nSometimes, I have suggested that they try drinking about two ounces \nof coffee with cream or milk along with a meal.  Its common \nfor them to find that this reduces their symptoms of hypoglycemia, and \nallows them to be symptom-free between meals.  Although we dont \nknow exactly why caffeine improves an athletes endurance, I think \nthe same processes are involved when coffee increases a persons endurance \nin ordinary activities. Caffeine \nhas remarkable parallels to thyroid and progesterone, and the use of \ncoffee or tea can help to maintain their production, or compensate for \ntheir deficiency.  Women spontaneously drink more coffee premenstrually, \nand since caffeine is known to increase the concentration of progesterone \nin the blood and in the brain, this is obviously a spontaneous and rational \nform of self-medication, though medical editors like to see things causally \nreversed, and blame the coffee drinking for the symptoms it is actually \nalleviating.  Some women have noticed that the effect of a progesterone \nsupplement is stronger when they take it with coffee.  This is \nsimilar to the synergy between thyroid and progesterone, which is probably \ninvolved, since caffeine tends tolocallyactivate thyroid secretion \nby a variety of mechanisms, increasing cyclic AMP and decreasing serotonin \nin thyroid cells , for example, \nand also by lowering the systemic stress mediators. Medical \neditors like to publish articles that reinforce important prejudices, \neven if, scientifically, they are trash.  The momentum of a bad \nidea can probably be measured by the tons of glossy paper that have \ngone into its development.  Just for the sake of the environment, \nit would be nice if editors would try to think in terms of evidence \nand biological mechanisms, rather than stereotypes.

        "chunk_html": "Coconut OilI \nhave already discussed the many toxic effects of the unsaturated oils, \nand I have frequently mentioned that coconut oil doesn't have those \ntoxic effects, though it does contain a small amount of the unsaturated \noils.  Many people have asked me to write something on coconut \noil.  I thought I might write a small book on it, but I realize \nthat there are no suitable channels for distributing such a book--if \nthe seed-oil industry can eliminate major corporate food products that \nhave used coconut oil for a hundred years, they certainly have the power \nto prevent dealers from selling a book that would affect their market \nmore seriously.  For the present, I will just outline some of the \nvirtues of coconut oil. The \nunsaturated oils in some cooked foods become rancid in just a few hours, \neven at refrigerator temperatures, and are responsible for the stale \ntaste of left-over foods.  (Eating slightly stale food isn't particularly \nharmful, since the same oils, even when eaten absolutely fresh, will \noxidize at a much higher rate once they are in the body, where they \nare heated and thoroughly mixed with an abundance of oxygen.)  \nCoconut oil that has been kept at room temperature for a year has been \ntested for rancidity, and showed no evidence of it.  Since we would \nexpect the small percentage of unsaturated oils naturally contained \nin coconut oil to become rancid, it seems that the other (saturated) \noils have an antioxidative effect: I suspect that the dilution keeps \nthe unstable unsaturated fat molecules spatially separated from each \nother, so they can't interact in the destructive chain reactions that \noccur in other oils.  To interrupt chain-reactions of oxidation \nis one of the functions of antioxidants, and it is possible that a sufficient \nquantity of coconut oil in the body has this function.  It is well \nestablished that dietary coconut oil reduces our need for vitamin E, \nbut I think its antioxidant role is more general than that, and that \nit has both direct and indirect antioxidant activities. Coconut \noil is unusually rich in short and medium chain fatty acids.  Shorter \nchain length allows fatty acids to be metabolized without use of the \ncarnitine transport system.  Mildronate, which I discussed in an \narticle on adaptogens, protects cells against stress partly by opposing \nthe action of carnitine, and comparative studies showed that added carnitine \nhad the opposite effect, promoting the oxidation of unsaturated fats \nduring stress, and increasing oxidative damage to cells.  I suspect \nthat a degree of saturation of the oxidative apparatus by short-chain \nfatty acids has a similar effect--that is, that these very soluble and \nmobile short-chain saturated fats have priority for oxidation, because \nthey don't require carnitine transport into the mitochondrion, and that \nthis will tend to inhibit oxidation of the unstable, peroxidizable unsaturated \nfatty acids. When \nAlbert Schweitzer operated his clinic in tropical Africa, he said it \nwas many years before he saw any cases of cancer, and he believed that \nthe appearance of cancer was caused by the change to the European type \nof diet.  In the l920s, German researchers showed that mice on \na fat-free diet were practically free of cancer.  Since then, many \nstudies have demonstrated a very close association between consumption \nof unsaturated oils and the incidence of cancer. Heart \ndamage is easily produced in animals by feeding them linoleic acid; \nthis \"essential\" fatty acid turned out to be the heart toxin \nin rape-seed oil.  The addition of saturated fat to the experimental \nheart-toxic oil-rich diet protects against the damage to heart cells. Immunosuppression was observed \nin patients who were being \"nourished\" by intravenous emulsions \nof \"essential fatty acids,\"  and as a result coconut \noil is used as the basis for intravenous fat feeding, except in organ-transplant \npatients.  For those patients, emulsions of unsaturated oils are \nused specifically for their immunosuppressive effects. General \naging, and especially aging of the brain, is increasingly seen as being \nclosely associated with lipid peroxidation. Several years ago I met an old \ncouple, who were only a few years apart in age, but the wife looked \nmany years younger than her doddering old husband.  She was from \nthe Philippines, and she remarked that she always had to cook two meals \nat the same time, because her husband couldn't adapt to her traditional \nfood.  Three times every day, she still prepared her food in coconut \noil.  Her apparent youth increased my interest in the effects of \ncoconut oil. In \nthe l960s, Hartroft and Porta gave an elegant argument for decreasing \nthe ratio of unsaturated oil to saturated oil in the diet (and thus \nin the tissues).  They showed that the \"age pigment\" \nis produced in proportion to the ratio of oxidants to antioxidants, \nmultiplied by the ratio of unsaturated oils to saturated oils.  \nMore recently, a variety of studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet \nlight induces peroxidation in unsaturated fats, but not saturated fats, \nand that this occurs in the skin as well as in vitro.  Rabbit experiments, \nand studies of humans, showed that the amount of unsaturated oil in \nthe diet strongly affects the rate at which aged, wrinkled skin develops.  \nThe unsaturated fat in the skin is a major target for the aging and \ncarcinogenic effects of ultraviolet light, though not necessarily the \nonly one. In \nthe l940s, farmers attempted to use cheap coconut oil for fattening \ntheir animals, but they found that it made them lean, active and hungry.  \nFor a few years, an antithyroid drug was found to make the livestock \nget fat while eating less food, but then it was found to be a strong \ncarcinogen, and it also probably produced hypothyroidism in the people \nwho ate the meat.  By the late l940s, it was found that the same \nantithyroid effect, causing animals to get fat without eating much food, \ncould be achieved by using soy beans and corn as feed. Later, \nan animal experiment fed diets that were low or high in total fat, and \nin different groups the fat was provided by pure coconut oil, or a pure \nunsaturated oil, or by various mixtures of the two oils.  At the \nend of their lives, the animals' obesity increased directly in proportion \nto the ratio of unsaturated oil to coconut oil in their diet, and was \nnot related to the total amount of fat they had consumed.  That \nis, animals which ate just a little pure unsaturated oil were fat, and \nanimals which ate a lot of coconut oil were lean. In \nthe l930s, animals on a diet lacking the unsaturated fatty acids were \nfound to be \"hypermetabolic.\"  Eating a \"normal\" \ndiet, these animals were malnourished, and their skin condition was \nsaid to be caused by a \"deficiency of essential fatty acids.\"  \nBut other researchers who were studying vitamin B6 recognized the condition \nas a deficiency of that vitamin.  They were able to cause the condition \nby feeding a fat-free diet, and to cure the condition by feeding a single \nB vitamin.  The hypermetabolic animals simply needed a better diet \nthan the \"normal,\" fat-fed, cancer-prone animals did. G. \nW. Crile and his wife found that the metabolic rate of people in Yucatan, \nwhere coconut is a staple food, averaged 25% higher than that of people \nin the United States.  In a hot climate, the adaptive tendency \nis to have a lower metabolic rate, so it is clear that some factor is \nmore than offsetting this expected effect of high environmental temperatures.  \nThe people there are lean, and recently it has been observed that the \nwomen there have none of the symptoms we commonly associate with the \nmenopause. By \nl950, then, it was established that unsaturated fats suppress the metabolic \nrate, apparently creating hypothyroidism.  Over the next few decades, \nthe exact mechanisms of that metabolic damage were studied.  Unsaturated \nfats damage the mitochondria, partly by suppressing the repiratory enzyme, \nand partly by causing generalized oxidative damage.  The more unsaturated \nthe oils are, the more specifically they suppress tissue response to \nthyroid hormone, and transport of the hormone on the thyroid transport \nprotein. Plants \nevolved a variety of toxins designed to protect themselves from \"predators,\" \nsuch as grazing animals.  Seeds contain a variety of toxins, that \nseem to be specific for mammalian enzymes, and the seed oils themselves \nfunction to block proteolytic digestive enzymes in the stomach.  \nThe thyroid hormone is formed in the gland by the action of a proteolytic \nenzyme, and the unsaturated oils also inhibit that enzyme.  Similar \nproteolytic enzymes involved in clot removal and phagocytosis appear \nto be similarly inhibited by these oils. Just \nas metabolism is \"activated\" by consumption of coconut oil, \nwhich prevents the inhibiting effect of unsaturated oils, other inhibited \nprocesses, such as clot removal and phagocytosis, will probably tend \nto be restored by continuing use of coconut oil. Brain \ntissue is very rich in complex forms of fats.  The experiment (around \n1978) in which pregnant mice were given diets containing either coconut \noil or unsaturated oil showed that brain development was superior in \nthe young mice whose mothers ate coconut oil.  Because coconut \noil supports thyroid function, and thyroid governs brain development, \nincluding myelination, the result might simply reflect the difference \nbetween normal and hypothyroid individuals.  However, in 1980, \nexperimenters demonstrated that young rats fed milk containing soy oil \nincorporated the oil directly into their brain cells, and had structurally \nabnormal brain cells as a result.  Lipid \nperoxidation occurs during seizures, and antioxidants such as vitamin \nE have some anti-seizure activity. Currently, lipid peroxidation is \nbeing found to be involved in the nerve cell degeneration of Alzheimer's \ndisease. Various \nfractions of coconut oil are coming into use as \"drugs,\" meaning \nthat they are advertised as treatments for diseases.  Butyric acid \nis used to treat cancer, lauric and myristic acids to treat virus infections, \nand mixtures of medium-chain fats are sold for weight loss.  Purification \nundoubtedly increases certain effects, and results in profitable products, \nbut in the absence of more precise knowledge, I think the whole natural \nproduct, used as a regular food, is the best way to protect health.  \nThe shorter-chain fatty acids have strong, unpleasant odors; for a couple \nof days after I ate a small amount of a medium-chain triglyceride mixture, \nmy skin oil emitted a rank, goaty smell.  Some people don't seem \nto have that reaction, and the benefits might outweigh the stink, but \nthese things just haven't been in use long enough to know whether they \nare safe. We \nhave to remember that the arguments made for aspartame, monosodium glutamate, \naspartic acid, and tryptophan--that they are like the amino acids that \nmake up natural proteins--are dangerously false.  In the case of \namino acids, balance is everything.  Aspartic and glutamic acids \npromote seizures and cause brain damage, and are intimately involved \nin the process of stress-induced brain aging, and tryptophan by itself \nis carcinogenic.  Treating any complex natural product as the drug \nindustry does, as a raw material to be fractionated in the search for \n\n\"drug\" products, is risky, because the relevant knowledge \nisn't sought in the search for an association between a single chemical \nand a single disease. While the toxic unsaturated paint-stock \noils, especially safflower, soy, corn and linseed (flaxseed) oils, have \nbeen sold to the public precisely for their drug effects, all of their \nclaimed benefits were false.  When people become interested in \ncoconut oil as a \"health food,\" the huge seed-oil industry--operating \nthrough their shills--are going to attack it as an \"unproved drug.\" While \ncomponents of coconut oil have been found to have remarkable physiological \neffects (as antihistamines, antiinfectives/antiseptics, promoters of \nimmunity, glucocorticoid antagonist, nontoxic anticancer agents, for \nexample), I think it is important to avoid making any such claims for \nthe natural coconut oil, because it very easily could be banned from \nthe import market as a \"new drug\" which isn't \"approved \nby the FDA.\"  We have already seen how money and propaganda \nfrom the soy oil industry eliminated long-established products from \nthe U.S. market.  I saw people lose weight stably when they had \nthe habit of eating large amounts of tortilla chips fried in coconut \noil, but those chips disappeared when their producers were pressured \ninto switching to other oils, in spite of the short shelf life that \nresulted in the need to add large amounts of preservatives.  Oreo \ncookies, Ritz crackers, potato chip producers, and movie theater popcorn \nmakers have experienced similar pressures. The \ncholesterol-lowering fiasco for a long time centered on the ability \nof unsaturated oils to slightly lower serum cholesterol.  For years, \nthe mechanism of that action wasn't known, which should have suggested \ncaution.  Now, it seems that the effect is just one more toxic \naction, in which the liver defensively retains its cholesterol, rather \nthan releasing it into the blood.  Large scale human studies have \nprovided overwhelming evidence that whenever drugs, including the unsaturated \noils, were used to lower serum cholesterol, mortality increased, from \na variety of causes including accidents, but mainly from cancer. Since \nthe l930s, it has been clearly established that suppression of the thyroid \nraises serum cholesterol (while increasing mortality from infections, \ncancer, and heart disease), while restoring the thyroid hormone brings \ncholesterol down to normal.  In this situation, however, thyroid \nisn't suppressing the synthesis of cholesterol, but rather is promoting \nits use to form hormones and bile salts.  When the thyroid is functioning \nproperly, the amount of cholesterol in the blood entering the ovary \ngoverns the amount of progesterone being produced by the ovary, and \nthe same situation exists in all steroid-forming tissues, such as the \nadrenal glands and the brain.  Progesterone and its precursor, \npregnenolone, have a generalized protective function: antioxidant, anti-seizure, \nantitoxin, anti-spasm, anti-clot, anti-cancer, pro-memory, pro-myelination, \npro-attention, etc.  Any interference with the formation of cholesterol \nwill interfere with all of these exceedingly important protective functions. As \nfar as the evidence goes, it suggests that coconut oil, added regularly \nto a balanced diet, lowers cholesterol to normal by promoting its conversion \ninto pregnenolone.  (The coconut family contains steroids that \nresemble pregnenolone, but these are probably mostly removed when the \nfresh oil is washed with water to remove the enzymes which would digest \nthe oil.)  Coconut-eating cultures in the tropics have consistently \nlower cholesterol than people in the U.S.  Everyone that I know \nwho uses coconut oil regularly happens to have cholesterol levels of \nabout 160, while eating mainly cholesterol rich foods (eggs, milk, cheese, \nmeat, shellfish).  I encourage people to eat sweet fruits, rather \nthan starches, if they want to increase their production of cholesterol, \nsince fructose has that effect. Many \npeople see coconut oil in its hard, white state, and--as a result of \ntheir training watching television or going to medical school--associate \nit with the cholesterol-rich plaques in blood vessels.  Those lesions \nin blood vessels are caused mostly by lipid peroxidation of unsaturated \nfats, and relate to stress, because adrenaline liberates fats from storage, \nand the lining of blood vessels is exposed to high concentrations of \nthe blood-borne material.  In the body, incidentally, the oil can't \nexist as a solid, since it liquefies at 76 degrees.  (Incidentally, \nthe viscosity of complex materials isn't a simple matter of averaging \nthe viscosity of its component materials; cholesterol and saturated \nfats sometimes lower the viscosity of cell components.) Most \nof the images and metaphors relating to coconut oil and cholesterol \nthat circulate in our culture are false and misleading.  I offer \na counter-image, which is metaphorical, but it is true in that it relates \nto lipid peroxidation, which is profoundly important in our bodies.  \nAfter a bottle of safflower oil has been opened a few times, a few drops \nthat get smeared onto the outside of the bottle begin to get very sticky, \nand hard to wash off.  This property is why it is a valued base \nfor paints and varnishes, but this varnish is chemically closely related \nto the age pigment that forms \"liver spots\" on the skin, and \nsimilar lesions in the brain, heart, blood vessels, lenses of the eyes, \netc.  The image of \"hard, white saturated coconut oil\" \nisn't relevant to the oil's biological action, but the image of \"sticky \nvarnish-like easily oxidized unsaturated seed oils\" is highly relevant \nto their toxicity. The \nability of some of the medium chain saturated fatty acids to inhibit \nthe liver's formation of fat very likely synergizes with the pro-thyroid \neffect, in allowing energy to be used, rather than stored.  When \nfat isn't formed from carbohydrate, the sugar is available for use, \nor for storage as glycogen.  Therefore, shifting from unsaturated \nfats in foods to coconut oil involves several anti-stress processes, \nreducing our need for the adrenal hormones.  Decreased blood sugar \nis a basic signal for the release of adrenal hormones.  Unsaturated \noil tends to lower the blood sugar in at least three basic ways.  \nIt damages mitochondria, causing respiration to be uncoupled from energy \nproduction, meaning that fuel is burned without useful effect.  \nIt suppresses the activity of the respiratory enzyme (directly, and \nthrough its anti-thyroid actions), decreasing the respiratory production \nof energy.  And it tends to direct carbohydrate into fat production, \nmaking both stress and obesity more probable.  For those of us \nwho use coconut oil consistently, one of the most noticeable changes \nis the ability to go for several hours without eating, and to feel hungry \nwithout having symptoms of hypoglycemia. One \nof the stylish ways to promote the use of unsaturated oils is to refer \nto their presence in \"cell membranes,\" and to claim that they \nare essential for maintaining \"membrane fluidity.\"  As \nI have mentioned above, it is the ability of the unsaturated fats, and \ntheir breakdown products, to interfere with enzymes and transport proteins, \nwhich accounts for many of their toxic effects, so they definitely don't \njust harmlessly form \"membranes.\"  They probably bind \nto all proteins, and disrupt some of them, but for some reason their \naffinity for proteolytic and respiration-related enzymes is particularly \nobvious.  (I think the chemistry of this association is going to \ngive us some important insights into the nature of organisms. Metchnikof's \nmodel that I have discussed elsewhere might give us a picture of how \nthose factors relate in growth, physiology, and aging.)  Unsaturated \nfats are slightly more water-soluble than fully saturated fats, and \nso they do have a greater tendency to concentrate at interfaces between \nwater and fats or proteins, but there are relatively few places where \nthese interfaces can be usefully and harmlessly occupied by unsaturated \nfats, and at a certain point, an excess becomes harmful.  We don't \nwant \"membranes\" forming where there shouldn't be membranes.  \nThe fluidity or viscosity of cell surfaces is an extremely complex subject, \nand the degree of viscosity has to be appropriate for the function of \nthe cell.  Interestingly, in some cells, such as the cells that \nline the air sacs of the lungs, cholesterol and one of the saturated \nfatty acids found in coconut oil can increase the fluidity of the cell \nsurface. In \nmany cases, stressful conditions create structural disorder in cells.  \nThese influences have been called \"chaotropic,\" or chaos-producing.  \nIn red blood cells, which have sometimes been wrongly described as \"hemoglobin \nenclosed in a cell membrane,\" it has been known for a long time \nthat lipid peroxidation of unsaturated fats weakens the cellular structure, \ncausing the cells to be destroyed prematurely.  Lipid peroxidation \nproducts are known to be \"chaotropic,\" lowering the rigidity \nof regions of cells considered to be membranes.  But the red blood \ncell is actually more like a sponge in structure, consisting of a \"skeleton\" \nof proteins, which (if not damaged by oxidation) can hold its shape, \neven when the hemoglobin has been removed.  Oxidants damage the \nprotein structure, and it is this structural damage which in turn increases \nthe \"fluidity\" of the associated fats. So, \nit is probably true that in many cases the liquid unsaturated oils do \nincrease \"membrane fluidity,\" but it is now clear that in \nat least some of those cases the \"fluidity\" corresponds to \nthe chaos of a damaged cell protein structure.  (N. V. Gorbunov, \n\"Effect of structural modification of membrane proteins on lipid-protein \ninteractions in the human erythrocyte membrane,\" Bull. Exp. Biol. \n& Med. 116(11), 1364-67. 1993. Although \nI had stopped using the unsaturated seed oils years ago, and supposed \nthat I wasn't heavily saturated with toxic unsaturated fat, when I first \nused coconut oil I saw an immediate response, that convinced me my metabolism \nwas chronically inhibited by something that was easily alleviated by \n\n\"dilution\" or molecular competition.  I had put a tablespoonful \nof coconut oil on some rice I had for supper, and half an hour later \nwhile I was reading, I noticed I was breathing more deeply than normal.  \nI saw that my skin was pink, and I found that my pulse was faster than \nnormal--about 98, I think.  After an hour or two, my pulse and \nbreathing returned to normal.  Every day for a couple of weeks \nI noticed the same response while I was digesting a small amount of \ncoconut oil, but gradually it didn't happen any more, and I increased \nmy daily consumption of the oil to about an ounce.  I kept eating \nthe same foods as before (including a quart of ice cream every day), \nexcept that I added about 200 or 250 calories per day as coconut oil.  \nApparently the metabolic surges that happened at first were an indication \nthat my body was compensating for an anti-thyroid substance by producing \nmore thyroid hormone; when the coconut oil relieved the inhibition, \nI experienced a moment of slight hyperthyroidism, but after a time the \ninhibitor became less effective, and my body adjusted by producing slightly \nless thyroid hormone.  But over the next few months, I saw that \nmy weight was slowly and consistently decreasing.  It had been \nsteady at 185 pounds for 25 years, but over a period of six months it \ndropped to about 175 pounds.  I found that eating more coconut \noil lowered my weight another few pounds, and eating less caused it \nto increase. The \nanti-obesity effect of coconut oil is clear in all of the animal studies, \nand in my friends who eat it regularly.  It is now hard to get \nit in health food stores, since Hain stopped selling it.  The Spectrum \nproduct looks and feels a little different to me, and I suppose the \nparticular type of tree, region, and method of preparation can account \nfor variations in the consistency and composition of the product.  \nThe unmodified natural oil is called \"76 degree melt,\" since \nthat is its natural melting temperature.  One bottle from a health \nfood store was labeled \"natural coconut oil, 92% unsaturated oil,\" \nand it had the greasy consistency of old lard.  I suspect that \nsomeone had confused palm oil (or something worse) with coconut oil, \nbecause it should be about 96% saturated fatty acids.  © Ray Peat 2006. All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com",

        "chunk_html": "Diabetes, scleroderma, oils and hormonesThe \nbasic argument:  Stress and aging make cells less responsive in \nmany ways by damaging their ability to produce energy and to adapt.  \nThe polyunsaturated fats are universally toxic to the energy producing \nsystem, and act as a \"misleading signal\" channeling cellular \nadaptation down certain self-defeating pathways.  Diabetes is just \none of the \"terminal\" diseases that can be caused by the polyunsaturated \nvegetable oils.  Coconut oil, in diabetes as in other degenerative \ndiseases, is highly protective. When \nthe oral contraceptive pill was new (Enovid), it was found to produce \nsigns of diabetes, including decreased glucose tolerance.  Spellacy \nand Carlson (1966) suggested that an elevation of circulating free fatty \nacids might be responsible, and remarked that \"Free fatty acids \ncan block the Krebs cycle, with relative insulin action resistance resulting.\"  \n\"The potential danger of the oral contraceptives is one of prolonged \npancreatic stimulation.\"  Recent papers are reporting that \nthe estrogen used to \"treat menopause\" causes an increase \nin free fatty acids.  Spellacy and Carlson suggested that estrogen's \neffect was mediated by growth hormone, and that is now the consensus. \nWomen are much more likely than men to develop diabetes. Ephraim \nRacker observed that free unsaturated fatty acids inhibit mitochondrial \nrespiration, and recent studies are finding that free linoleic and linolenic \nacids act as intracellular regulators, stimulating the protein kinase \nC (PKC) system, which is also stimulated by estrogen and the (cancer \npromoting) phorbol esters.  They stimulate the cell while blocking \nthe energy it needs to respond. Scleroderma, \nor systemic sclerosis, is a supposedly mysterious condition in which \ntissues harden, with an excessive deposition of fibrous material.  \nBesides hardening the skin, it can involve fibrosis of the heart and \nother organs, and can cause changes in blood vessels of the kidneys \nlike those seen in some types of hypertension, and often involves Raynaud's \nphenomenon and osteoporosis of the fingers.  (Silicone functions \nas an adjuvant, making exposure to irritants, solvents or infections \nmore harmful.  This seems to be the reason for the association \nbetween breast implants and scleroderma.)  Another type of disease \nthat involves hardening of the skin is scleredema, in which the skin \nthickens with an accumulation of \"mucin\" between collagen \nbundles, and in which fibroblasts are overactive in producing collagen. \n(Varga, et al.)  This condition is believed to often follow a \"febrile \nillness\" and is associated with diabetes.  My interest in \nthese conditions comes from my awareness that estrogen promotes collagen \nformation, and that changes in the connective tissue are deeply associated \nwith the processes of stress and aging, following the ideas of Metchnikov \nand Selye. Many \npeople are still committed to the various old theories of diabetes, \nthough a few are showing ways in which multiple causes can lead to diabetes.  \nIncreasingly, old age itself is seen to be \"like diabetes (Meneilly, \net al.; Smith, et al.), and the situation is ripe for a recentering \nof our understanding of diabetes around some of the general facts about \naging and stress. Diabetes \nmellitus, as named, refers to excessive urination and sugary urine, \nbut it is now often diagnosed in people who neither urinate excessively \nnor pass glucose in the urine, on the basis of a high level of glucose \nin the blood.  Many other signs (abnormal mucopolysaccharide metabolism \nwith thickening of basement membranes, leakage of albumin through capillary \nwalls and into the urine, a high level of free fatty acids in the blood, \ninsensitivity of tissues to insulin, or reduced sensitivity of the beta \ncells to glucose) are considered diagnostic by some people, who believe \nthat the worst aspects of the disease can be prevented if they can diagnose \nearly and take preventive measures.  This attitude derives largely \nfrom the genetic theory of causation, though it incorporates a belief \nthat (environmental) intervention can ameliorate the course of the disease.  \nWhen I wrote Nutrition for Women, I mentioned that the sudden appearance \nof diabetes in non-European Jews when they moved to Isreal made the \ngenetic theory of diabetes untenable, and since then other studies have \nmade the similar point that environmental factors seem crucial. (Shaltout, \net al.)  Many people are arguing for the racial/genetic theory \nof diabetes, but they are failing to consider some simple dietary factors, \nespecially the high consumption of unsaturated seed oils and the combination \nof nutritional deficiencies and environmental stress. I \nhave known adults and children who were diagnosed as diabetic, and given \ninsulin (and indoctrinated with the idea that they had a terminal degenerative \ndisease) on the strength of a single test showing excessive glucose.  \nWhen I taught at the naturopathic medical school in Portland, I tried \nto make it clear that \"diabetes\" (a term referring to excessive \nurination) is a function, and that a high level of glucose in the blood \nor urine is also a function, and that the use of insulin should require \na greater diagnostic justification than the use of aspirin for a headache \ndoes, because insulin use itself constitutes a serious health problem.  \n(And we seldom hear the idea that \"diabetes\" might have a \npositive side [Robinson and Johnston], for example that it reduces the \nsymptoms of asthma [Vianna and Garcialeme], which get worse when insulin \nis given.  Normal pregnancy can be considered \"diabetic\" \nby some definitions based on blood sugar.  I got interested in \nthis when I talked to a healthy \"diabetic\" woman who had a \ntwo year old child whose IQ must have been over 200, judging by his \nspontaneous precocious hobbies.  Old gynecologists told me that \nit was common knowledge that \"diabetic\" women had intellectually \nprecocious children.) When \nnon-diabetic apes were given insulin treatments, they developed some \nof the same \"complications of diabetes\" that are seen in humans, \nand antibodies to insulin were found in their retinas, suggesting that \nsome \"complications of diabetes\" were complications of insulin \ntreatment.  Patients were seldom well informed of the arguments \nagainst the use of insulin, but the justification for the new genetically \nengineered human insulin is precisely that it avoids immunological damage. Insulin \nwas introduced into medicine in the 1920s.  According to the Britannica \nBook of the Year for 1947, page 265, \"Mortality from diabetes in \n1920 in the United States was 16.0 per 100,000, 14,062 deaths, but in \n1944, it was 26.4 per 100,000, 34,948 deaths.\" One of the theories of the cause \nof diabetes is that a virus damages the beta cells in the pancreas, \nand the main argument for that in the 1970s was that the onset of diabetes \nin children can often be dated to a time shortly after a severe viral \ninfection.  It is true that intense sickness and a high fever (and \nhigh doses of drugs given to treat the sickness) can cause very high \nlevels of glucose in the blood, and even glucose in the urine, but this \nis a fairly well recognized consequence of stress.  High doses \nof cortisone (prednisone, etc.) typically cause elevated glucose levels.  \nCushing's syndrome usually involves hyperglycemia.  Normally, this \nis just a functional response to an excess of glucocorticoids, but studies \nin dogs suggested that intense and/or prolonged stress can damage the \ninsulin-secreting cells in the pancreas.  Dogs had half of their \npancreas removed, to increase the burden put on the remaining tissue, \nand after a large dose of cortisone the dogs became (and remained) diabetic. One \nof the problems associated with diabetes is the calcification of blood \nvessels, though now there is more emphasis on fatty degeneration.  \nOther blood vessel problems include hypertension, and poor circulation \nin general, leading to gangrene of the feet, impotence, and degeneration \nof the retina. In muscles, and probably in other tissues of diabetics, \ncapillaries are more widely spaced, as if the basal oxidative requirement \nwere lower than normal.  However, mitochondria contain more respiratory \nenzymes, as if to partly compensate for the poor delivery of oxygen \nto the cells. Osteoporosis or osteopenia is a common complication of \ndiabetes, and seems to be associated with the calcification of soft \ntissues. F. \nZ. Meerson's description of the stress-injured heart is very similar \nto the general changes that occur in chronic diabetes.  He found \nthat the stressed heart becomes rigid and unable to contract completely, \nor to relax completely.  Excess calcium enters cells, and fatty \nacids are mobilized both locally and systemically, and both of these \ntend to damage the mitochondria.  In diabetes, fatty acids are \nmobilized and oxidized instead of glucose, and calcium enters cells, \nincreasing their rigidity and preventing relaxation of muscles in blood \nvessels.  (I'm not sure whether it is relevant to cell physiology, \nbut the presence of an excess of free unsaturated fatty acids, and of \ncalcium, in cells makes me think of the insoluble soap that these substances \nform in other situations, including the intestine.  It seems that \nthis could form a harmful deposit in cells, blocking many metabolic \nprocesses.)  For \nmany years, histologists have observed that calcium and iron tend to \nbe deposited together in \"devitalized\" tissues.  Now \nwe know that cell death from a great variety of causes involves the \ncell's absorption of increased amounts of calcium.  Simply the \nlack of energy increases the amount of calcium in a cell, and stimulation \nor excitation does the same, creating or exaggerating a deficiency of \nenergy.  In low thyroid people, many (if not all) tissues are very \neasily damaged.  Since glucose is needed by liver cells to produce \nthe active (T3) form of thyroid, diabetes almost by definition will \nproduce hypothyroidism, since in diabetes glucose can't be absorbed \nefficiently by cells. In \nthe form of cell damage caused by the \"excitotoxins,\" glutamic \nand aspartic acids, the damage seems to require both stimulation, and \ndifficulty in maintaining adequate energy production.  This combination \nleads to both calcium uptake and lipid peroxidation.  When cells \nare de-energized, they tend to activate iron by chemical reduction, \nproducing lipid peroxidation.  This could explain the presence \nof chemically active iron, but an actual increase in the iron concentration \nsuggests that there has been prolonged injury (oxidative stress) to \nthe cell, with increased production of the heme group, which binds iron. Hans \nSelye found that he could produce scleroderma (hardening and calcification \nof the skin) in rats by giving them a toxic dose of a heavy metal, and \nthen irritating the skin a little by plucking hair. Iron is now tending \nto be recognized as a factor in inflammation.  Vitamin E was able \nto prevent the development of scleroderma under Selye's experimental \nconditions, suggesting that the irritation allowed the heavy metal to \ncause oxidative damage to the skin.  Selye found other ways to \ncause calcification of tissues, including the walls of arteries, but \nhe directed most of his attention to the role of \"pro-inflammatory\" \nhormones.  A decreased blood supply was often used to predispose \nan organ to calcification.  In diabetes, a characteristic feature \nis that the blood supply is relatively remote from cells in muscle and \nskin, so the oxygen and nutrients have to diffuse farther than in normal \nindividuals, and the ATP level of cells is characteristically lower \nthan normal.  In blood cells, both red (Garnier, et al.) and white \ncells are probably more rigid in diabetes, because of lower ATP production, \nand higher intracellular calcium and sodium. Magnesium \nin the cell is largely associated with ATP, as the complex Mg-ATP.  \nWhen ATP is \"used\" or converted to ADP, this lower-energy \nsubstance associates with calcium, as Ca-ADP.  In a hypothyroid \nstate, the energy charge can be depleted by stress, causing cells to \nlose magnesium.  ATP is less stable when it isn't complexed with \nmagnesium, so the stress-induced loss of magnesium makes the cell more \nsusceptible to stress, by acting as a chronic background stimulation, \nforcing the cell to replace the ATP which is lost because of its instability.  \nIn this state, the cell takes up an excess of calcium. The picture that I think explains \nmany of the features of diabetes is that an energy deficit produces \nan alarm state, causing increased production of adrenalin and cortisol.  \nAdrenalin mobilizes fat from storage, and the free fatty acids create \na chronic problem involving 1) blocked ATP production, 2) activation \nof the protein kinase C system (increasing tension in blood vessels), \n3) inhibition of thyroid function with its energetic, hormonal, and \ntissue-structure consequences, 4) availability of fats for prostaglandin \nsynthesis, and 5) possibly a direct effect on clot dissolving, besides \nthe PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor) effect seen in diabetes \n(Ceriello, et al., Udvardy, et al., Vague, et al.).  (Estrogen \nhas many pro-clotting effects, and one of them is a decreased activity \nof vascular plasminogen activator.  K. E. Miller and S. V. Pizzo, \n\"Venous and arterial thromboembolic disease in women using oral \ncontraceptives,\" Am. J. Obst. Gyn. 144, 824, 1982.  In 1968, \nD. G. Daniel et al., reported that estrogen promotes thromboembolism \nby increasing clotting factor IX in the blood.) Increased \nentry of calcium into cells is complexly related to increased exposure \nto unsaturated fatty acids, decreased energy, and lipid peroxidation.  \nOsteoporosis, calcification of soft tissues and high blood pressure \nare promoted by multiple stresses, hypothyroidism, and magnesium deficiency.  \nThe particular direction a disease takes--diabetes, scleroderma, lupus, \nAlzheimer's, stroke, etc.--probably results from the balance between \nresources and demands within a particular organ or system.  Calcium \noverload of cells can't be avoided by avoiding dietary calcium, because \nthe bones provide a reservoir from which calcium is easily drawn during \nstress.  (In fact, the reason calcium can temporarily help prevent \nmuscle cramps seems to be that it makes magnesium more available to \nthe muscles.) If \nwe want to stop a disease that involves abnormal calcification or contraction \nof muscle (see Zenere, et al.), we can increase our consumption of magnesium, \nand to cause cells to absorb and retain the magnesium, we can increase \nour thyroid function.  The use of coconut oil provides energy to \nstabilize blood sugar while protecting mitochondria and the thyroid \nsystem from the harmful effects of unsaturated fats. In \n1947, B. A. Houssay found that a diet based on sugar as a source of \nenergy was more protective against diabetes than a diet based on lard, \nwhile the most protective diet was based on coconut oil.  Lard \nreflects the pigs' diet, and is usually extremely unsaturated, especially \nsince it became standard to fatten them on soybeans and corn.  \nEssentially, his study seems to show that unsaturated (pork) fat permits \ndiabetes to develop, sugar is slightly protective, and coconut oil is \nvery protective against the form of diabetes caused by a poison. At \nthe same time, A. Lazarow was demonstrating that a low protein diet \nmade animals more sensitive to diabetes, and that cysteine, glutathione, \nand thioglycolic acid (antioxidants) are protective against diabetes. \nThe chelator of metals, BAL (British anti-lewisite), was also found \nto protect against diabetes. Taken \ntogether, those studies suggest that the oxidizable unsaturated fats \nare involved in the process of producing diabetes.  At the same \ntime, other studies were showing that the unsaturated oils suppress \nthe thyroid, and that coconut oil increases the metabolic rate, apparently \nby normalizing thyroid function.  Hypothyroidism is known to include \ndeposition of mucopolysaccharides in tissues, increased permeability \nof capillaries with leakage of albumin out of the blood, elevated adrenalin \nwhich can lead to increased production of cortisol, decreased testosterone \nproduction, high risk of heart and circulatory disease, including a \ntendency to ulceration of the extremities, and osteoporosis, all of \nwhich are recognized \"complications of diabetes.\"  Broda \nBarnes gave all of his diabetic patients a thyroid supplement, and found \nthat none of them developed the expected complications of diabetes. Recently, a high safflower oil \ndiet was found to cause diabetes (Ikemoto, et al.), and obesity itself \nis thought to be a factor in developing diabetes.  The hormone \npatterns associated with obesity can be seen as either cause or effect \nof the obesity (or both cause and effect), since, for example, low thyroid \ncan increase both estrogen and cortisol, which support the formation \nof fat, and the fat cells can become a chronic source of estrogen synthesis. On \na diet lacking the \"essential\" unsaturated fatty acids, Benhamou \n(1995) found that nonobese diabetic mice didn't develop diabetes, that \nis, the unsaturated fats themselves, without obesity, are sufficient \nto cause diabetes.  (Also see Girard; Golay, et al., and Kusunoki, \net al.) Estrogen and the polyunsaturated \nfatty acids (PUFA), linoleic and linolenic acid, alike activate the \nprotein kinase C (PKC) system of cellular activation.  Many of \nthe functions of PUFA are similar to the functions of estrogen (e.g., \nantagonism to thyroid function, promotion of age pigment/lipofuscin), \nso this information showing that they both act similarly on the same \nbasic regulatory pathway is important.  Estrogen increases secretion \nof growth hormone (GH; it's closely associated with prolactin, also \nincreased by estrogen), and GH causes an increase in free fatty acids \nin the blood.  Estrogen promotes iron retention, so it sets the \nstage for oxidative stress.  At least in some systems, both estrogen \nand PUFA promote the entry of calcium into the cell. In \ndiabetes, there is a generalized excess activation of the PKC system. \nThe starch-based diet, emphasizing grains, beans, nuts, and vegetables, \nhas been promoted with a variety of justifications. When people are \nurged to reduce their fat and sugar consumption, they are told to eat \nmore starch.  Starch stimulates the appetite, promotes fat synthesis \nby stimulating insulin secretion, and sometimes increases the growth \nof bacteria that produce toxins.  It is often associated with allergens, \nand according to Gerhard Volkheimer, whole starch grains can be \"persorbed\" \nfrom the intestine directly into the blood stream where they may block \narterioles, causing widely distributed nests of cell-death.  I \nhave heard dietitians urge the use of \"complex carbohydrates\" \n(starch) instead of sugar.  In the first physiology lab I took, \nwe fed rats a large blob of moist cornstarch with a stomach tube, and \nthen after waiting a few minutes, were told to dissect the rat to find \nout \"how far the starch had gone.\"  In such a short time, \nwe were surprised to find that not a trace of the starch could be found.  \nThe professor's purpose was to impress us with the rapidity with which \nstarch is digested and absorbed.  Various studies have demonstrated \nthat starch (composed of pure glucose) raises blood glucose more quickly \nthan sucrose (half fructose, half glucose) does.  The sudden increase \nof blood glucose is sometimes thought to contribute to the development \nof diabetes, but if it does, it is probably mediated by fat metabolism \nand the hormones other than just insulin. Brewer's \nyeast has been used successfully to treat diabetes.  In the l930s, \nmy father had severe diabetes, but after a few weeks of living on brewer's \nyeast, he recovered and never had any further evidence of diabetes.  \nBesides its high B-vitamin and protein content, yeast is an unusual \nfood that should be sparingly used, because of its high phosphorous/calcium \nratio, high potassium to sodium ratio, and high estrogen content.  \nThe insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas have estrogen receptors, \nbut I don't know of any new research investigating this aspect of yeast \ntherapy.  In rabbit studies, diabetes produced by alloxan poisoning, \nwhich kills the beta cells, was cured by DHEA treatment, and beta cells \nwere found to have regenerated in the pancreatic islets. I \nthink the basic anti-aging diet is also the best diet for prevention \nand treatment of diabetes, scleroderma, and the various \"connective \ntissue diseases.\"  This would emphasize high protein, low \nunsaturated fats, low iron, and high antioxidant consumption, with a \nmoderate or low starch consumption.  In practice, this means that \na major part of the diet should be milk, cheese, eggs, shellfish, fruits \nand coconut oil, with vitamin E and salt as the safest supplements.  \nIt should be remembered that amino acids, especially in eggs, stimulate \ninsulin secretion, and that this can cause hypoglycemia, which in turn \ncauses cortisol secretion.  Eating fruit (or other carbohydrate), \ncoconut oil, and salt at the same meal will decrease this effect of \nthe protein. Magnesium carbonate and epsom salts can also be useful \nand safe supplements, except when the synthetic material causes an allergic \nbowel reaction.. Although \nI started this newsletter with the thought of discussing the Mead acids--the \nunsaturated (n-9) fats that are formed under certain conditions, especially \nwhen the dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids are \"deficient\"--and \ntheir prostaglandin derivatives as a distinct anti-stress, anti-aging \nsystem, the loss of which makes us highly susceptible to injury, I will \nsave that argument for a future time, leaving this newsletter as an \naddition to the view that an excess of the polyunsaturated fats is central \nto the development of degenerative diseases:  Cancer, heart disease, \narthritis, immunodeficiency, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, connective \ntissue disease, and calcification.

        "chunk_html": "Epilepsy and ProgesteroneThe \nlength of the life-span, and of the period of youth or immaturity, is \nclosely associated with the size of the brain, and the brain has a very \nhigh rate of metabolism. When something interferes with this very high \nmetabolic rate, the consequences may be instantanteous,* or developmental, \nor chronic and degenerative, or even transgenerational. The issue of \nepilepsy centers on questions of brain metabolism, and so it has all \nof those dimensions. As \nI discuss the mechanisms known to predispose a person to epilepsy, I \nwill emphasize the centrality of oxidative energy production, and show \nhow \"stroke,\" \"stress,\" \"hyperactivity,\" \n\"dementia,\" and other brain syndromes are related to \"epilepsy.\" \n\n(Similar processes are being studied in the heart and other tissues; \neventually, we might have a general language that will make it easier \nto understand the parallels in the various kinds of \"seizure\" \nin any organ.) As \nan old term, \"epilepsy\" has aquired a burden of pseudoscientific \nideas, covering old superstitions with an overlay of new superstitions. \n[Hereditary epilepsy has been discussed in countless textbooks and medical \njournals, but I think a much better case could be made for the inheritance \nof a tendency to offer stupid genetic explanations.] \"Hereditary \nepilepsy\" and \"idiopathic epilepsy\" are seriously pathogenic \nterms; \"brain scar\" sometimes has a factual basis, but most \noften the term is an evasion of understanding. As \nlong as we realize that the essential meaning of the word is \"something \nthat grabs you,\" \"epilepsy\" is a convenient way to refer \nto a cluster of convulsive states, fainting spells, night-terrors and \nnightmares, and strange sensations. Seizures can be caused by lack \nof glucose, lack of oxygen, vitamin B6 deficiency, and magnesium deficiency. \nThey are more likely to occur during the night, during puberty, premenstrually, \nduring pregnancy, during the first year of life, and can be triggered \nby hyperventilation, running, strong emotions, or unusual sensory stimulation. \nWater retention and low sodium increase susceptibility to seizures. \nWhen I was in high school, our dog found and ate a pint of bacon grease, \nand shortly afterward had a convulsive seizure. I knew of veterinarians \nwho treated seizures in dogs with a vermifuge, so it seemed obvious \nthat a metabolic disturbance, especially if combined with intestinal \nirritation, could cause fits. It was undoubtedly such observations \nthat led some physicians to advocate removal of the colon as treatment \nfor epilepsy.  Pregnancy and the menstrual cycle have been recognized \nas having something to do with seizures, but when seizures occurred \nonly during pregnancy, they were classified as nonepileptic, and when \nthey had a clear premenstrual occurrence, they were likely to be classified \nas \"hysterical fits,\" to be treated with punishment. It has been observed that all \n\"recognized\" anti-seizure drugs are teratogenic, and women \nwho are taking such drugs are told that pregnancy might kill them if \nthey stop the drug, but that their babies will have a greatly increased \nrisk of birth defects if they take the drugs during pregnancy. This \nis why a better understanding of epilepsy is very important.  Old therapies \nare mainly important for the insight they can give into the nature of \nthe physiological problem. Some of the well established clinical-laboratory \nobservations (F. Mora, and C. S. Babel, for example) give strong hints \nas to the physiological problem, for example, low albumin, high prealbumin, \nlow magnesium and high calcium all suggest hypothyroidism. (Problems \nwith the bowel, liver, and sex hormones are highly associated with hypothyroidism, \nboth as causes and as effects.) Water retention was so clearly involved \nin seizures that increased water intake was used as a diagnostic procedure. \n(R. Grinker) Unfortunately, animal experiments showed that water intoxication \nincreased susceptibility to seizures even in normal individuals. Low \nsodium content in the body fluids also predisposed to seizures, so that \nsomeone with hyponatremia (low blood sodium) would be more susceptible \nto induction of a seizure by excessive water intake. (Excessive water \nuptake is still recognized as a factor in seizures, but now it is seen \nas part of a complex process, involving energy, hormones, and transmitter \nsubstances. E.g., Kempski; Chan.) Hypothyroid \npeople tend to lose sodium easily, and unopposed estrogen increases \nwater retention, without an equivalent sodium retention, so low thyroid, \nhigh estrogen people have two of the conditions (edema and hyponatremia) \nknown to predispose to seizures.  Another outstanding feature of seizures \nof various sorts is that they are most likely to occur at night, especially \nin the early pre-dawn hours. Low blood sugar and high adrenalin predominate \nduring those hours. Hypoglycemia, in itself, like oxygen deprivation, \nis enough to cause convulsions. Progesterone \nand thyroid promote normal energy production, and their deficiency causes \na tendency toward hypoglycemia, edema and instability of nerves. Twenty years ago, a woman who \nwas considered demented visited me. From the age of 21, she had been \nincreasingly disabled by premenstrual migraines. When she was 35 she \nwas a school teacher, and during the summer a neurologist told her that \ndilantin would help her headaches, because \"migraine is similar \nto epilepsy.\" Although she told the neurologist that the drug made \nher \"too stupid to teach school,\" he offered her no alternatives, \nand didn't mention that sudden withdrawal from the drug could trigger \na seizure. When classes started she discontinued the dilantin and had \na seizure. The neurologist said the seizure proved that migraines were \na form of epilepsy. At the age of 52, she spent about 20 hours a day \nin bed, and couldn't go outside by herself, because she would get lost. \nAfter using a little progesterone for a few days, she stopped having \nseizures, discontinued her drugs, and was able to work. When she returned \nto graduate school, she got straight As, and earned her masters' degree \nin gerontology. But she had lost 17 years because the drug industry \nhad covered up the role of the hormones in epilepsy, migraine, and the \nperimenstrual syndrome. The \nmost popular anticonvulsant drugs are both neurotoxic and teratogenic, \nthat is, they damage the patient's brain, and greatly increase the incidence \nof birth defects. The Nazis justified their horrible medical experiments \nas \"science,\" but the effects of epilepsy medicine in the \nlast half century have been similar in effect, grander in scale, and \nwithout any scientific justification. Besides \nthe specific promotional efforts of the drug industry and their branch \nof government, there is a broader situation that makes their work easier. \nIt is a culture of goony ideas, that ultimately emanates from the academic \nelite, which (since Descartes, and before) places \"thought\" \nabove evidence. In biology, \"genes\" and \"membranes\" \n\nare confused ideas that are used to justify actions that aren't based \non evidence. For the Nazis, \"cultural degeneracy\" was a medical-biological-political \ncategory based on that style of thinking. In the United States, \"genes\" \nfor epilepsy, hyperactivity, language development, IQ, eclampsia, etc., \nare \"found\" at Harvard/MIT/Stan- ford/Yale/Univ. of California, \netc., by an elite whose wits have been dulled by environmental deprivation, \nthat is, by a lack of criticism. By manipulating the diet and environment, \nanimals can be made more or less seizure-prone, and it happens that \nthe changes that affect the brain affect all other organs, in ways that \nare now fairly well understood. Examining the cellular events associated \nwith a seizure is useful for therapy and prevention of seizures, but \nthe same methods are helpful for many other conditions. It is now clearly \nestablished that stress can cause brain damage, as well as other diseases. \nNow that our public health establishment has eliminated smoking from \npublic places, maybe they can find a way to reduce stress and disease \nby removing morons from positions of power. Excitotoxicity, \nin its simplest sense, is the harmful cellular effect (death or injury) \ncaused by an excitatory transmitter such as glutamate or aspartate acting \non a cell whose energetic reserves aren't adequate to sustain the level \nof activity provoked by the transmitter. Once an excitotoxic state exists, \nthe consequences of cell exhaustion can increase the likelihood that \nthe condition will spread to other cells, since any excitation can trigger \na complex of other excitatory processes. As calcium enters cells, potassium \nleaves, and enzymes are activated, producing free fatty acids (linoleic \nand arachidonic, for example) and prostaglandins, which activate other \nprocesses, including lipid peroxidation and free radical production. \nProtein kinase C (promoted by unsaturated fats and estrogen) facilitates \nthe release of excitatory amino acids. (See J. W. Phillis and M. H. \nO'Regan, \"Mechanisms of glutamate and aspartate release in the \nischemic rat cerebral cortex,\" Br. Res. 730(1-2), 150-164, 1996.) \nEstrogen supports acetylcholine release, which leads to increased extracellular \npotassium and excitatory amino acids. (See R. B. Gibbs, et al., \"Effects \nof estrogen on potassium-stimulated acetylcholine release in the hippocampus \nand overlying cortex of adult rats,\" Br. Res. 749(1), 143-146, \n1997.) Estrogen \nalso stimulates the production of free radicals. Calcium, free radicals, \nand unsaturated free fatty acids impair energy production, decreasing \nthe ability to regulate potassium and calcium. The increased estrogen \nassociated with seizures is associated with reduced serum calcium (Jacono \nand Robertson, 1987). Feedback self-stimulation of free radicals, free \nfatty acids, and prostaglandins create a bias toward increased excitation. Ammonia \nis produced by stimulated nerves, and normally its elimination helps \nto eliminate and control the excitotoxic amino acids, glutamate and \naspartate. The production of urea consumes aspartic acid, converting \nit to fumaric acid, but this requires carbon dioxide, produced by normal \nmitochondrial function. A deficiency of carbon dioxide would reduce \nthe delivery of oxygen to the brain by constricting blood vessels and \nchanging hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen (limiting carbon dioxide production), \nand the failure to consume aspartate (in urea synthesis) and glutamate \n(as alpha-ketoglutarate) and aspartate (as oxaloacetate) in the Krebs \ncycle, means that as energy becomes deficient, excitation tends to be \npromoted. This helps to explain the fact that seizures can be induced \nby hypoxia. (Balloonists and mountain climbers at extremely high elevations \nhave mentioned suffering from severe insomnia. The mechanisms of excitotoxicity \nare probably involved in other forms of insomnia, too.)  Antioxidants \nhelp to control seizures, by reducing the excitatory contribution of \nfree radicals and lipid peroxidation. Since excitation can promote the \ntoxic forms of oxidation, many surprising substances turn out to have \nan \"antioxidant\" function. Magnesium, sodium (balancing calcium \nand potassium), thyroid and progesterone (increasing energy production), \nand in some situations, carbon dioxide. Aspirin, by inhibiting prostaglandin \nsynthesis (and maybe other mechanisms) often lowers free radical production. \nAdenosine seems to have a variety of antioxidant functions, and one \nmechanism seems to be its function as an antiexcitatory transmitter. \nOne of estrogen's excitant actions on the brain probably involves its \nantagonism to adenosine (Phillis and O'Regan, 1988). Albumin, \nbesides maintaining blood volume and preventing edema, serves to protect \nrespiration, by binding free fatty acids. Estrogen blocks the liver's \nability to produce albumin, and increases the level of circulating free \nfatty acids. Free fatty acids cause brain edema. This is probably another \naspect of estrogen's contribution to seizure susceptibility. Magnesium \nsulfate has been used for generations in India to treat eclampsia and \n\"toxemia\" of pregnancy, and its effectiveness is gradually \ncoming to be recognized in the U.S. Increasingly, magnesium deficiency \nis recognized as a factor that increases susceptibility to seizures. \n(Valenzuela and Benardo, 1995; Slandley, et al., 1995). Hypothyroidism \nreduces the ability of cells to retain magnesium.  Thyroid does \nmany things to protect against seizures. It keeps estrogen and adrenal \nhormones low, and increases production of progesterone and pregnenolone. \nIt facilitates retention of magnesium and of sodium, and prevents edema \nin a variety of ways. Progesterone, \nbecause of its normal anesthetic function (which prevents the pain of \nchildbirth when its level is adequate), directly quiets nerves, and \nin this way suppresses many of the excitotoxic processes. It has direct \neffects on mitochondria, promoting energy production, and it facilitates \nthyroid hormone functions in various ways. It promotes the elimination \nof estrogen from tissues, and is a \"diuretic\" in several benign \nways, that are compatible with maintenance of blood volume. It antagonizes \nthe mineralocorticoids and the glucocorticoids, both of which promote \nseizures. (Roberts and Keith, 1995.) The combination of hypoglycemia \nwith elevation of cortisone probably accounts for the nocturnal incidence \nof seizures. If \nprogesterone's antiepileptic effectiveness were not enough (and it is \nvery effective even in irrational pharmaceutical formulations), the \nfact that it reduces birth defects, and promotes brain development and \nnerve repair should assure its general use in women with a history of \nseizures, until it is established that they are no longer \"epileptic.\" \n Although thyroid, progesterone, and a high quality protein diet will \ngenerally correct the epilepsy problem, it is important to mention that \nthe involvement of unsaturated fats and free radicals in seizure physiology \nimplies that we should minimize our consumption of the unsaturated fats. \nEven years after eliminating them from the diet, their release from \ntissue storage can prolong the problem, and during that time the use \nof vitamin E is likely to reduce the intensity and frequency of seizures. \nCoconut oil lowers the requirement for vitamin E, and reduces the toxicity \nof the unsaturated fats (see Cleland, et al.), favoring effective respiration \nand improving thyroid and progesterone production.  Endotoxin formed \nin the bowel can block respiration and cause hormone imbalances contributing \nto instability of the nerves, so it is helpful to optimize bowel flora, \nfor example with a carrot salad; a dressing of vinegar, coconut oil \nand olive oil, carried into the intestine by the carrot fiber, suppresses \nbacterial growth while stimulating healing of the wall of the intestine. \nThe carrot salad improves the ratio of progesterone to estrogen and \ncortisol, and so is as appropriate for epilepsy as for premenstrual \nsyndrome, insomnia, or arthritis. NOTES: When \nthe brain loses its oxygen supply, consciousness is lost immediately, \nbefore there is much decrease in the ATP concentration. This has led \nto the proposal of interesting \"electronic\" ideas of consciousness, \nbut there is another way of viewing this. While ATP constitutes a kind \nof reservoir of cellular energy, the flow of carbon dioxide through \nthe brain cell is almost the mirror image of the flow of oxygen. Oxygen \nscarcity leads directly to carbon dioxide scarcity. The \"sensitive \nstate,\" consciousness, might require the presence of carbon dioxide \nas well as ATP, to sustain a cooperative, semi-stable, state of the \ncytoplasmic proteins. The ability of ordinary light to trigger a conformation \nchange in the hemoglobin-carbon monoxide-carbon dioxide system shows \nhow sensitive a system with only a few elements can be. At the other \nextreme from consciousness, there is the evidence that carbon dioxide \nis essential for even the growing/living state of protozoa, algae, and \nbacteria.(O. Rahn, 1941.) O. Rahn, \"Protozoa need carbon \ndioxide for growth,\" Growth 5, 197-199, 1941. \"On page 113 \nof this volume, the statement of Valley and Rettger that all bacteria \nneed carbon dioxide for growth had been shown to apply to young as well \nas old cells.\" \"...it is possible...to remove it as rapidly \nas it is produced, and under these circumstances, bacteria cannot multiply.\" REFERENCES E.

Estrogen \r\nis now mainly promoted to prevent osteoporosis (another problem that \r\nis more common in women) and heart disease (which is more common in \r\nmen).This \r\nsubstance, which came into medical use as \"the female hormone\" \r\nfor the treatment of \"female problems,\" especially for improving \r\nfertility, and then for preventing fertility as the oral contraceptive, \r\nis now being aimed primarily at the post-reproductive population, for \r\nproblems that are essentially unrelated to femininity.  It is, \r\nin fact, being presented to the public as something to prevent major \r\nage-related conditions.Brain \r\ndegeneration, like osteoporosis, takes years to develop.  Analysis \r\nof letters written by young women, for example, showed limited mental \r\nfunctioning in those who many years later developed Alzheimer's disease, \r\nand young women who have small bones are the ones most likely to develop \r\nosteoporosis later.It seems clear that the course of degenerative \r\naging processes is set in young adulthood (or even earlier), and that \r\nit is never too early to be concerned with correcting processes that \r\nare going in the wrong direction.(See Walker, et al., 1988, \r\nand Smith, et al., 1992.)In \r\n\"The Biological Generality of Progesterone\" (1979) I proposed \r\nthat the life-long trajectory of energy production and longevity was \r\nstrongly influenced by prenatal nutrition and progesterone.  This \r\nidea was based on work by people such as Marion Diamond, who showed \r\nthat prenatal progesterone enlarges the cortex of the brain, and that \r\nestrogen makes it smaller, and Leonell Strong, who showed that a treatment \r\nthat lowered the estrogen function in a young mouse could produce cancer-free \r\noffspring for several generations.  Strong's work was very encouraging, \r\nbecause it showed that biological problems that had been \"bred \r\nin\" over many generations could be corrected by some simple metabolic \r\ntreatments.Seeing \r\nthese profoundly toxic long-range effects of estrogen, which shaped \r\nthe animal's growth, development, function, and even its heredity, made \r\nit important to learn how estrogen works, because such fundamental changes \r\ncovering the whole range of biology, produced by a simple little molecule, \r\npromised to reveal interesting things about the nature of life.Aging \r\nis an energy problem, and in the brain, which has extremely high energy \r\nrequirements, interference with the energy supply quickly causes cells \r\nto die.I \r\nbelieve that estrogen's \"principle,\" in all of its actions, \r\nis to interfere with the respiratory mode of energy production.  \r\nThis is an integrating principle that explains estrogen's immediate, \r\ndirect effects on cells and organisms, which aren't explained by the \r\nidea that it acts on the genes through a specific \"estrogen receptor.\"  \r\n(It's hard to imagine, for example, how the \"estrogen receptor\" \r\n\r\ndoctrine could explain the fact that a single injection of estrogen \r\ncan kill a large portion of brain cells.)  It explains why estrogen \r\ncauses cells to take up water, allowing calcium to enter, activating \r\nvarious enzymes and cell division.  On the organismic level, it \r\nexplains why estrogen mimics \"shock,\" releasing histamine \r\nand activating the nervous and glandular stress response system.  \r\nThe inefficiency of metabolism which doesn't use oxygen in the normal \r\nway causes glucose to be used rapidly, and this in itself is enough \r\nto trigger the release of pituitary ACTH and adrenal cortisol.  \r\nThe ACTH, and related hormones, liberate free fatty acids, which cells \r\ntake up instead of glucose, and this (in the so-called Randall cycle) \r\nfurther limits the body's ability to oxidize glucose.People \r\nhave spoken of \"cascades\" in relation to the adrenal glucocorticoids \r\n(e.g., cortisol) and estrogen, leading to cell damage, but really both \r\nof these hormonal cascades have to be seen as part of a more general \r\ncollapse of adaptive systems, as a result of both chronic and immediate \r\ninadequacies of energy production.Estrogen \r\nactivates the adrenal stress reaction by way of the hypothalamus and \r\npituitary, by direct actions on the adrenal glands, and by a variety \r\nof indirect effects, such as the increase of free fatty acids.  \r\nIt activates the excitotoxic glutamic acid pathway, and interferes with \r\nprotective adenosine inhibition of nerves.  It has both direct \r\nand indirect ways of promoting the formation of nitric oxide and carbon \r\nmonoxide.  These, and other estrogen-promoted factors, quickly \r\nand seriously interfere with mitochondrial respiration.  Many of \r\nthese effects contribute to increased intracellular calcium and free \r\nradical production, contributing to both the excitatory excess and the \r\nenergy deficit.The \r\nbiochemical details of these cascades are mainly interesting because \r\nthey show how many different kinds of stress converge on a few physiological \r\nprocessess--mitochondrial energy production, cellular excitation, and \r\nintercellular communication--which, when damaged thousands of times, \r\nlead to the familiar states of old age.  These few functions, damaged \r\nby an infinite variety of stresses, have their own complexly adaptive \r\nways of deteriorating, producing the various degenerative diseases.This \r\nperspective brings dementia, heart failure, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency \r\nand other diseases of aging together, in ways that allow generalized \r\ntherapeutic and preventive approaches.The \r\nantistress, antiestrogen approaches become fundamental to prevention \r\nof aging.The \r\npro-estrogenic nature of the unsaturated fatty acids is probably the \r\nbiggest barrier to the radical elimination of degenerative diseases.  \r\nVarious saturated fatty acids, including butyric, octanoic, and palmitic, \r\nhave protective effects on mitochondrial respiration.Progesterone \r\nis the basic brain-protective antiestrogen.  It works to protect \r\nthe brain at many levels (preventing lipid peroxidation, exitotoxicity, \r\nnitric oxide damage, energy deficit, edema, etc.) and it promotes repair \r\nand recovery.Progesterone \r\nin most cases has effects opposite to estrogen's, improving mitochondrial \r\nenergy production while preventing excessive excitation.  Along \r\nwith pregnenolone, progesterone is recognized as a neurosteroid with \r\nanti-excitotoxic actions, with the ability to promote repair and regeneration \r\nof the nervous system. (Roof, Stein, Faden; Schumacher, et al.; Baulieu.)The \r\nuse of aspirin, which reduces inflammation and inhibits the formation \r\nof neurotoxic prostaglandins, is known to be associated with a lower \r\nincidence of Alzheimer's disease, and in other contexts, it offers protection \r\nagainst estrogen.  Naloxone, the antiendorphin, has been found \r\nto reverse some of the cumulative effects of stress, restoring some \r\npituitary and ovarian function, and it promotes recovery after brain \r\ninjury;in a variety of ways, it corrects some of estrogen's \r\ntoxic effects.Adenosine \r\nhelps to maintain brain glycogen stores, which are lost in stress and \r\naging.  Vitamin B12 protects against nitric oxide, and improves \r\nalertness.Pyruvic \r\nacid has brain-protective effects, apparently through its decarboxylation \r\n(producing carbon dioxide) rather than through its use as an energy \r\nsource, since other ketoacids are similarly protective.  (The ketoacids \r\noccur in some natural foods.) The directly brain-protective effect of \r\ncarbon dioxide offers many clues that should be interpreted in relation \r\nto estrogen's toxicity, since many of their effects on nerves are opposite.Estrogen blocks the production of energy while it stimulates nerve cells \r\nto use energy more rapidly, and carbon dioxide promotes the production \r\nof energy, while restraining the excitation which expends energy.The presence of carbon dioxide is an indicator of proper mitochondrial \r\nrespiratory functioning.Pharmaceutical \r\nblockers of glutamic acid transmission, and of calcium and sodium uptake, \r\nprevent some deterioration following brain injury, but the most physiological \r\nway to protect against those toxic processes is to maintain metabolic \r\nenergy at a high level.  Magnesium, which is protective against \r\nexcitatory damage and is a calcium antagonist, tends to be retained \r\nin proportion to the activity of thyroid hormone.As \r\nI have discussed previously, progesterone alone has brought people out \r\nof post-epileptic dementia and senile dementia, but it is reasonable \r\nto use a combined physiological approach, including thyroid.Besides \r\nproviding new insights into biological energy and aging, the recognition \r\nthat estrogen activates the stress hormone system--the pituitary-adrenal \r\nsystem--also provides clear insights into other problems, such as the \r\npolycystic ovary syndrome, hirsutism, adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's \r\ndisease, etc.REFERENCES[The \r\nreferences are clustered into groups, showing estrogen's indirect toxicity \r\nthrough its activation of the adrenal hormones, its direct brain-toxicity, \r\nand some of the interactions between these and fats, nitric oxide, etc.].Stress 1996 Jul;1(1):1-19Stress, Glucocorticoids, and Damage to the Nervous System: The Current \r\nState of Confusion.Sapolsky RM Department of Biological Sciences, \r\nStanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.An extensive literature \r\ndemonstrates that glucocorticoids (GCs), the adrenal steroids secreted \r\nduring stress, can have a broad range of deleterious effects in the \r\nbrain. The actions occur predominately, but not exclusively, in the \r\nhippocampus, a structure rich in corticosteroid receptors and particularly \r\nsensitive to GCs. The first half of this review considers three types \r\nof GC effects: a) GC-induced atrophy, in which a few weeks' exposure \r\nto high GC concentrations or to stress causes reversible atrophy of \r\ndendritic processes in the hippocampus; b) GC neurotoxicity where, over \r\nthe course of months, GC exposure kills hippocampal neurons; c) GC neuroendangerment, \r\nin which elevated GC concentrations at the time of a neurological insult \r\nsuch as a stroke or seizure impairs the ability of neurons to survive \r\nthe insult. The second half considers the rather confusing literature \r\nas to the possible mechanisms underlyingthese deleterious GC actions. \r\nFive broad themes are discerned: a) that GCs induce a metabolic vulnerability \r\nin neurons due to inhibition of glucose uptake; b) that GCs exacerbate \r\nvarious steps in adamaging cascade of glutamate excess, calcium \r\nmobilization and oxygen radical generation. In a review a number of \r\nyears ago, I concluded that these two components accounted for the deleterious \r\nGC effects. Specifically, the energetic vulnerability induced by GCs \r\nleft neurons metabolically compromised, and less able to carry out the \r\ncostly task of containing glutamate, calcium and oxygen radicals. More \r\nrecent work has shown this conclusion to be simplistic, and GC actions \r\nare shown to probably involve at least three additional components: \r\nc) that GCs impair a variety of neuronal defenses against neurologic \r\ninsults; d) that GCs disrupt the mobilization of neurotrophins; e) that \r\nGCs have a variety of electrophysiological effects which can damage \r\nneurons.The relevance of each of those mechanisms to GC-induced \r\natrophy, neurotoxicity and neuroendangerment is considered, as are the \r\nlikely interactions among them.J Clin Endocrinol Metab 1996 \r\nOct;81(10):3639-43Short-term estradiol treatment enhances pituitary-adrenal \r\naxis and sympathetic responses to psychosocial stress in healthy young \r\nmen.Kirschbaum C, Schommer N, Federenko I, Gaab J, Neumann O, Oellers \r\nM, Rohleder N, Untiedt A, Hanker J, Pirke KM, Hellhammer DH Center for \r\nPsychobiological, University of Trier, Germany.Evidence from animal \r\nstudies and clinical observations suggest that the activity of the pituitary-adrenal \r\naxis is under significant influence of sex steroids. The present study \r\ninvestigated how a short term elevation of estradiol levels affects \r\nACTH, cortisol, norepinephrine, and heart rate responses to mental stress \r\nin healthy men.In a double blind study, 16 men received a patch \r\ndelivering 0.1 mg estradiol/day transdermally, and age- and body mass \r\nindex-matched control subjects received a placebo patch. Twenty-four \r\nto 48 h later, they were exposed to a brief psychosocial stressor (free \r\nspeech and mental arithmetic in front of an audience). In response to \r\nthe psychosocial stressor, ACTH, cortisol, norepinephrine, and heart \r\nrate were increased in both experimental groups (all P < 0.0001). \r\nHowever, theestradiol-treated subjects showed exaggerated peak ACTH \r\n(P < 0.001) and cortisol (P < 0.002) responses compared to the \r\nplacebo group. Also, the norepinephrine area under the response curve \r\nwas greater in the estradiol group(P < 0.05). Although heart rate responses differences failed to reach \r\nstatistical significance, they, too, tended to be larger in the estradiol \r\ngroup. Neither mood ratings before or after the stressor, nor ratings \r\nof the perception of the stressor could explain the observed endocrine \r\nresponse differences. In conclusion,short term estradiol administration \r\nresulted in hyperresponses of the pituitary-adrenal axis and norepinephrine \r\nto psychosocial stress in healthy young men independent of psychological \r\neffects,as assessed in this study.J Appl Physiol 1996 Mar;80(3):931-9Treadmill exercise training and estradiol increase plasma ACTH and prolactin \r\nafter novel footshock.White-Welkley JE, Warren GL, Bunnell BN, \r\nMougey EH, Meyerhoff JL, Dishman RK  \"We examined whether \r\nrats that were treadmill exercise trained (Tr) or chronically immobilized \r\n(CI) had similar responses by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) \r\ncortical axis to acute stress and whether the HPA responses interacted \r\nwith the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis.\"\"[ACTH] \r\nand [prolactin] afterfootshock were higher in Tr rats with E2 \r\ncompared with CI and sedentary rats without E2;recovery levels \r\nfor sedentary animals were higher after Run compared with Im.

Furthermore, we have shown that this beta-endorphin cell loss \r\nis followed by a compensatory upregulation of mu opioid receptors in \r\nthe vicinity of LHRH cell bodies.The increment in mu opioid receptors \r\npresumably renders the opioid target cells supersensitive to either \r\nresidual beta-endorphin or other endogenous mu ligands, such as met-enkephalin, \r\nthus resulting in chronic opioidsuppression of the pattern of LHRH \r\nrelease, and subsequently that of LH.Indeed, prevention of the \r\nneuroendocrine effects of estradiol by antioxidant treatment alsoprevents the cascade of neuroendocrine aberrations resulting in anovulatory \r\nacyclicity.The loss of beta-endorphin neurons along with the paradoxical \r\nopioid supersensitivity which ensues, provides a unifying framework \r\nin which to interpret the diverse features that characterize the reproductively \r\nsenescent female.The 21-aminosteroid antioxidant, \r\nU74389F, prevents estradiol-induced depletion of hypothalamic beta-endorphin \r\nin adult female rats.Schipper HM; Desjardins GC; Beaudet A; Brawer \r\nJR.

Brain glycogen may have adynamic role as a buffer \r\nbetween the abrupt increases in focal metabolic demands that occur during \r\nnormal brain activity and the compensatory changes in focal cerebral \r\nblood flow or oxidative metabolism.\"Free fatty acids activate \r\nthe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in rats.\"Widmaier EP; Rosen K; Abbott B.Endocrinology,1992 Nov, 131:5, 2313-8. \"Intravenous administration of Intralipid \r\n10% increases blood levels of essential free fatty acids.\" \"Since \r\ncorticosterone, the final secretory product of the rat hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical \r\n(HPA) axis, is also lipolytic, we tested the hypothesis that FFA would \r\ninhibit the HPA axis.\" \"At 60 min, plasma ACTH levels were \r\nsignificantly elevated to over 1500 pg/ml in Intralipid-infused rats, \r\nbut were unchanged in saline controls.This dose of Intralipid increased \r\ncorticosterone levels by nearly 20-fold at 120 min.

They respond to neuronal activity and \r\nsynaptically released glutamate by raising intracellular calcium concentration \r\n([Ca2+]i), which could represent the start of back-signalling to neurons.Here we show that coactivation of the AMPA/kainate and metabotropic \r\nglutamate receptors (mGluRs) on astrocytes stimulates these cells to \r\nrelease glutamate through a Ca2+-dependent process mediated by prostaglandins. \r\nPharmacological inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis prevents glutamate \r\nrelease, whereas application of prostaglandins (in particular PGE2) \r\nmimics and occludes the releasing action of GluR agonists. PGE2 promotes \r\nCa2+-dependent glutamate release from cultured astrocytes and also from \r\nacute brain slices under conditions that suppress neuronal exocytotic \r\nrelease.When applied to the CA1 hippocampal region, PGE2 induces \r\nincreases in [Ca2+]i both in astrocytes and in neurons. The [Ca2+]i \r\nincrease in neurons is mediated by glutamate released from astrocytes, \r\nbecause it is abolished by GluR antagonists.Our results reveal a \r\nnew pathway of regulated transmitter release from astrocytes and outline \r\nthe existence of an integrated glutamatergic cross-talk between neurons \r\nand astrocytes in situ that may play critical roles in synaptic plasticity \r\nand in neurotoxicity.Prog Neurobiol 1998 Jan;54(1):99-125. \r\nMicroglia as effector cells in brain damage and repair: focus on prostanoids \r\nand nitric oxide.Minghetti L, Levi G.\"The present article deals with two classes of compounds that activated \r\nmicroglial cells can produce in large amounts: prostanoids (that derive \r\nfrom arachidonic acid through the cyclooxygenase pathway), and nitric \r\noxide (that is synthesized from arginine by nitric oxide synthase). \r\nProstanoids and nitric oxide have a number of common targets, on which \r\nthey may exert similar or opposite actions, and have a crucial role \r\nin the regulation of inflammation, immune responses and cell viability. \r\nTheir synthesis can massively increase when the inducible isoforms of \r\ncyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase are expressed.\"In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim \r\n1998 Mar;34(3):265-74.

Inmales, testosterone of gonadal origin is converted to estrogen in the \r\nbrainby an enzyme, aromatase, which is also present in females. \r\nThe exposure of the male's hypothalamus to relatively high levels of \r\nestrogen (following a perinatal testosterone surge) leads to the development \r\nof a pattern of synaptogenesiswhich does not support an estrogen-induced \r\ngonadotrophin surge in the adult.In female rats, hypothalamic \r\ndevelopmentoccurs with permissively low levelsof estrogen, \r\nenabling a midcycle estrogen-induced gonadotrophin surge and ovulation \r\nin adulthood.

All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com^^^Top^^^ Although \r\nthe incidence of Alzheimer's disease is 2 or 3 times as high among women \r\nas among men, there is a major campaign under way to convince the public \r\nthat taking estrogen supplements will prevent the disease.  Estrogen \r\nis now mainly promoted to prevent osteoporosis (another problem that \r\nis more common in women) and heart disease (which is more common in \r\nmen). This \r\nsubstance, which came into medical use as \"the female hormone\" \r\nfor the treatment of \"female problems,\" especially for improving \r\nfertility, and then for preventing fertility as the oral contraceptive, \r\nis now being aimed primarily at the post-reproductive population, for \r\nproblems that are essentially unrelated to femininity.  It is, \r\nin fact, being presented to the public as something to prevent major \r\nage-related conditions. Brain \r\ndegeneration, like osteoporosis, takes years to develop.  Analysis \r\nof letters written by young women, for example, showed limited mental \r\nfunctioning in those who many years later developed Alzheimer's disease, \r\nand young women who have small bones are the ones most likely to develop \r\nosteoporosis later.It seems clear that the course of degenerative \r\naging processes is set in young adulthood (or even earlier), and that \r\nit is never too early to be concerned with correcting processes that \r\nare going in the wrong direction.(See Walker, et al., 1988, \r\nand Smith, et al., 1992.) In \r\n\"The Biological Generality of Progesterone\" (1979) I proposed \r\nthat the life-long trajectory of energy production and longevity was \r\nstrongly influenced by prenatal nutrition and progesterone.  This \r\nidea was based on work by people such as Marion Diamond, who showed \r\nthat prenatal progesterone enlarges the cortex of the brain, and that \r\nestrogen makes it smaller, and Leonell Strong, who showed that a treatment \r\nthat lowered the estrogen function in a young mouse could produce cancer-free \r\noffspring for several generations.  Strong's work was very encouraging, \r\nbecause it showed that biological problems that had been \"bred \r\nin\" over many generations could be corrected by some simple metabolic \r\ntreatments. Seeing \r\nthese profoundly toxic long-range effects of estrogen, which shaped \r\nthe animal's growth, development, function, and even its heredity, made \r\nit important to learn how estrogen works, because such fundamental changes \r\ncovering the whole range of biology, produced by a simple little molecule, \r\npromised to reveal interesting things about the nature of life. Aging \r\nis an energy problem, and in the brain, which has extremely high energy \r\nrequirements, interference with the energy supply quickly causes cells \r\nto die. I \r\nbelieve that estrogen's \"principle,\" in all of its actions, \r\nis to interfere with the respiratory mode of energy production.  \r\nThis is an integrating principle that explains estrogen's immediate, \r\ndirect effects on cells and organisms, which aren't explained by the \r\nidea that it acts on the genes through a specific \"estrogen receptor.\"  \r\n(It's hard to imagine, for example, how the \"estrogen receptor\" \r\n\r\ndoctrine could explain the fact that a single injection of estrogen \r\ncan kill a large portion of brain cells.)  It explains why estrogen \r\ncauses cells to take up water, allowing calcium to enter, activating \r\nvarious enzymes and cell division.  On the organismic level, it \r\nexplains why estrogen mimics \"shock,\" releasing histamine \r\nand activating the nervous and glandular stress response system.  \r\nThe inefficiency of metabolism which doesn't use oxygen in the normal \r\nway causes glucose to be used rapidly, and this in itself is enough \r\nto trigger the release of pituitary ACTH and adrenal cortisol.  \r\nThe ACTH, and related hormones, liberate free fatty acids, which cells \r\ntake up instead of glucose, and this (in the so-called Randall cycle) \r\nfurther limits the body's ability to oxidize glucose. People \r\nhave spoken of \"cascades\" in relation to the adrenal glucocorticoids \r\n(e.g., cortisol) and estrogen, leading to cell damage, but really both \r\nof these hormonal cascades have to be seen as part of a more general \r\ncollapse of adaptive systems, as a result of both chronic and immediate \r\ninadequacies of energy production. Estrogen \r\nactivates the adrenal stress reaction by way of the hypothalamus and \r\npituitary, by direct actions on the adrenal glands, and by a variety \r\nof indirect effects, such as the increase of free fatty acids.  \r\nIt activates the excitotoxic glutamic acid pathway, and interferes with \r\nprotective adenosine inhibition of nerves.  It has both direct \r\nand indirect ways of promoting the formation of nitric oxide and carbon \r\nmonoxide.  These, and other estrogen-promoted factors, quickly \r\nand seriously interfere with mitochondrial respiration.  Many of \r\nthese effects contribute to increased intracellular calcium and free \r\nradical production, contributing to both the excitatory excess and the \r\nenergy deficit. The \r\nbiochemical details of these cascades are mainly interesting because \r\nthey show how many different kinds of stress converge on a few physiological \r\nprocessess--mitochondrial energy production, cellular excitation, and \r\nintercellular communication--which, when damaged thousands of times, \r\nlead to the familiar states of old age.  These few functions, damaged \r\nby an infinite variety of stresses, have their own complexly adaptive \r\nways of deteriorating, producing the various degenerative diseases. This \r\nperspective brings dementia, heart failure, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency \r\nand other diseases of aging together, in ways that allow generalized \r\ntherapeutic and preventive approaches. The \r\nantistress, antiestrogen approaches become fundamental to prevention \r\nof aging. The \r\npro-estrogenic nature of the unsaturated fatty acids is probably the \r\nbiggest barrier to the radical elimination of degenerative diseases.  \r\nVarious saturated fatty acids, including butyric, octanoic, and palmitic, \r\nhave protective effects on mitochondrial respiration. Progesterone \r\nis the basic brain-protective antiestrogen.  It works to protect \r\nthe brain at many levels (preventing lipid peroxidation, exitotoxicity, \r\nnitric oxide damage, energy deficit, edema, etc.) and it promotes repair \r\nand recovery. Progesterone \r\nin most cases has effects opposite to estrogen's, improving mitochondrial \r\nenergy production while preventing excessive excitation.  Along \r\nwith pregnenolone, progesterone is recognized as a neurosteroid with \r\nanti-excitotoxic actions, with the ability to promote repair and regeneration \r\nof the nervous system. (Roof, Stein, Faden; Schumacher, et al.; Baulieu.) The \r\nuse of aspirin, which reduces inflammation and inhibits the formation \r\nof neurotoxic prostaglandins, is known to be associated with a lower \r\nincidence of Alzheimer's disease, and in other contexts, it offers protection \r\nagainst estrogen.  Naloxone, the antiendorphin, has been found \r\nto reverse some of the cumulative effects of stress, restoring some \r\npituitary and ovarian function, and it promotes recovery after brain \r\ninjury;in a variety of ways, it corrects some of estrogen's \r\ntoxic effects. Adenosine \r\nhelps to maintain brain glycogen stores, which are lost in stress and \r\naging.  Vitamin B12 protects against nitric oxide, and improves \r\nalertness. Pyruvic \r\nacid has brain-protective effects, apparently through its decarboxylation \r\n(producing carbon dioxide) rather than through its use as an energy \r\nsource, since other ketoacids are similarly protective.  (The ketoacids \r\noccur in some natural foods.) The directly brain-protective effect of \r\ncarbon dioxide offers many clues that should be interpreted in relation \r\nto estrogen's toxicity, since many of their effects on nerves are opposite.Estrogen blocks the production of energy while it stimulates nerve cells \r\nto use energy more rapidly, and carbon dioxide promotes the production \r\nof energy, while restraining the excitation which expends energy.The presence of carbon dioxide is an indicator of proper mitochondrial \r\nrespiratory functioning. Pharmaceutical \r\nblockers of glutamic acid transmission, and of calcium and sodium uptake, \r\nprevent some deterioration following brain injury, but the most physiological \r\nway to protect against those toxic processes is to maintain metabolic \r\nenergy at a high level.  Magnesium, which is protective against \r\nexcitatory damage and is a calcium antagonist, tends to be retained \r\nin proportion to the activity of thyroid hormone. As \r\nI have discussed previously, progesterone alone has brought people out \r\nof post-epileptic dementia and senile dementia, but it is reasonable \r\nto use a combined physiological approach, including thyroid. Besides \r\nproviding new insights into biological energy and aging, the recognition \r\nthat estrogen activates the stress hormone system--the pituitary-adrenal \r\nsystem--also provides clear insights into other problems, such as the \r\npolycystic ovary syndrome, hirsutism, adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's \r\ndisease, etc. © Ray Peat Ph.D. 2009.

        "chunk_html": "Estrogen and Osteoporosis\"How does estrogen enhance endotoxin toxicity? Let me count the ways.\"J.J. Maher (Liver Center and Department of Medicine, University of\n\n      California San Francisco) in Hepatology, 1998, 28(6):1720-1.The government declared victory in the war on cancer, though the\n\nage-specific death rate from cancer keeps increasing.  In the equally well\n\npublicized effort to prevent disability and death from osteoporosis, no one\n\nis declaring victory, because the only trend in its incidence that has been\n\nreported is an increase.  The estrogen-promoting culture tells us that this\n\nis because of the aging of the population, but the age corrected numbers\n\nstill show a great increase--for example, in Finland between 1970 and 1995,\n\nthe number of women (for a given population of women older than 60)\n\nbreaking their forearm because of osteoporosis more than doubled (Palvanen,\n\net al., 1998).  That this happened during a time when the use of estrogen\n\nhad become much more common doesn't present a good argument for the\n\nprotective effects of estrogen treatment.  (And during this period there\n\nwas a large increase in the consumption of estrogenic soy products.) \n\nRecently our local newspaper had a story at the bottom of the front page\n\nreporting that lean women who used estrogen and synthetic progestins had an\n\n80% higher rate of breast cancer.  Several days later, across the top of\n\nthe front page, there was a rebuttal article, quoting some doctors\n\nincluding a \"world class expert on hormone replacement therapy\" and a woman\n\nwho has taken Premarin for forty years and urges everyone to take it.  The\n\n\"protection against osteoporosis\" and against heart disease, they said,\n\nmust be weighed against a trifle such as the 80% increase in cancer.  It\n\nappeared that the newspaper was apologizing for reporting a fact that could\n\nmake millions of women nervous. (Jan 26, Register-Guard).Medical magazines, like the mass media, don't like to miss any opportunity\n\nto inform the public about the importance of using estrogen to prevent\n\nosteoporosis.  Their attention to the bone-protective effect of\n\nprogesterone has been noticeably less than their mad campaign to sell\n\nestrogen, despite the evidence that progesterone can promote bone\n\nrebuilding, rather than just slowing its loss.  Although I have spoken\n\nabout progesterone and osteoporosis frequently in the last 25 years, I have\n\nonly occasionally considered what estrogen does to bones; generally, I\n\ndescribed estrogen as a stress-promoting and age-promoting hormone.  In the\n\n1970s, pointing out progesterone's protective antagonism to excessive\n\namounts of other hormones, and that the catabolic glucocorticoids tend to\n\nincrease with aging, I began referring to progesterone as the\n\n\"anticatabolic\" hormone that should be used to prevent stress-induced\n\natrophy of skin, bones, brain, etc.A former editor of Yearbook of Endocrinology had reviewed a series of\n\nstudies showing that excess prolactin can cause osteoporosis.  Then, he\n\npresented a group of studies showing how estrogen promotes the secretion of\n\nprolactin, and can cause hyperprolactinemia.  In that review, he wryly\n\nwondered how something that increases something that causes osteoporosis\n\ncould prevent osteoporosis.Women have a higher incidence of osteoporosis than men do.  Young women\n\nhave thinner more delicate bones than young men.  The women who break bones\n\nin old age are generally the women who had the thinnest bones in youth.\n\nMenstrual irregularities, and luteal defects, that involve relatively high\n\nestrogen and low progesterone, increase bone loss.Fatter women are less likely to break bones than thinner women.  Insulin,\n\nwhich causes the formation of fat, also stimulates bone growth.  Estrogen\n\nhowever, increases the level of free fatty acids in the blood, indicating\n\nthat it antagonizes insulin (insulin decreases the level of free fatty\n\nacids), and the fatty acids themselves strongly oppose the effects of\n\ninsulin.  Estrogen dominance is widely thought to predispose women to\n\ndiabetes.Between the ages of 20 and 40, there is a very considerable increase in the\n\nblood level of estrogen in women.  However, bone loss begins around the age\n\nof 23, and progesses through the years when estrogen levels are rising.\n\nOsteoarthritis, which involves degeneration of the bones around joints, is\n\nstrongly associated with high levels of estrogen, and can be produced in\n\nanimals with estrogen treatment.Thirty years ago, when people were already claiming that estrogen would\n\nprevent or cure osteoporosis, endocrinologists pointed out that there was\n\nno x-ray evidence to support the claim. Estrogen can cause a positive\n\ncalcium balance, the retention of more calcium than is excreted, and the\n\nestrogen promoters argued that this showed it was being stored in the\n\nbones, but the endocrine physiologists showed that estrogen causes the\n\nretention of calcium by soft tissues.  There are many reasons for not\n\nwanting calcium to accumulate in the soft tissues; this occurs normally in\n\naging and stress.Then, it was discovered that, although estrogen doesn't improve the\n\nactivity of the cells that build bone, it can reduce the activity of the\n\ncells that remove bone, the osteoclasts.  The osteoclast is a type of\n\nphagocytic cell, and is considered to be a macrophage, the type of  cell\n\nthat can be found in any organ, which can eat any sort of particle, and\n\nwhich secretes substances (cytokines, hormone-like proteins) that modify\n\nthe functions of other cells.  When estrogen was found to impair the\n\nactivity of this kind of cell, there wasn't much known about macrophage\n\ncytokines.With the clear evidence that estrogen inhibits the osteoclasts without\n\nactivating the bone-building osteoblasts, estrogen was said to \"prevent\n\nbone loss,\" and from that point on we never heard again about estrogen\n\npromoting a positive calcium balance.  Calcium retention by soft tissues\n\nhas come to be an accepted marker of tissue aging, tissue damage,\n\nexcitotoxicity, and degeneration.  Positive calcium balance had been the\n\nessence of the argument for using estrogen to prevent osteoporosis:  \"Women\n\nare like chickens, estrogen makes them store calcium in their bones.\"  But\n\nif everyone now recognizes that calcium isn't being stored in bones, it's\n\nbetter for the estrogen industry if we forget about the clearly established\n\npositive calcium balance produced by estrogen.The toxic effects of excessive intracellular calcium (decreased respiration\n\nand increased excitation) are opposed by magnesium.  Both thyroid and\n\nprogesterone improve magnesium retention.  Estrogen dominance is often\n\nassociated with magnesium deficiency, which can be an important factor in\n\nosteoporosis (Abraham and Grewal, 1990; Muneyyirci-Delale, et al., 1999).\n\nAs part of the campaign to get women to use estrogen, an x-ray (bone\n\ndensity) test was devised which can supposedly measure changes in the\n\nmineral content of bone.  However, it happens that fat and water interfere\n\nwith the measurements.  Estrogen changes the fat and water content of\n\ntissues.  By chance, the distortions produced by fat and water happen to be\n\nsuch that estrogen could appear to be increasing  the density of a bone,\n\nwhen it is really just altering the soft tissues. Ultrasound measurements\n\ncan provide very accurate measurements of bone density, without the fat and\n\nwater artifacts that can produce misleading results in the x-ray procedure,\n\nand don't expose the patient to radiation, but the ultrasound method is\n\nseldom used.In recent years, there has been quite a lot of research into the effects\n\nof the macrophage cytokines.  Immune therapy for cancer was considered\n\nquackery when Lawrence Burton identified some substances in blood serum\n\nthat could cause massive tumors in rodents to disappear in just a few\n\nhours.  One of the serum factors was called Tumor Necrosis Factor, TNF.  An\n\nofficial committee was formed to evaluate his work, but it reported that\n\nthere was nothing to it.  A member of the committee later became known as\n\n\"the authority\" on tumor necrosis factor, which was thought to have great\n\npotential as an anticancer drug.  However, used by itself, TNF killed only\n\na few cancers, but it damaged every organ of the body, usually causing the\n\ntissues to waste away.  Other names, lymphotoxin and cachectin, reflected\n\nits toxic actions on healthy tissues.Aging involves many changes that tend to increase the inflammatory\n\nreaction, and generally the level of TNF increases with aging.\n\nAlthough cancer, heart failure, AIDS, and extreme hormone deficiency (from\n\nloss of the pituitary or thyroid gland, for example) can cause cachexia of\n\nan extreme and rapid sort, ordinary aging is itself a type of cachexia.\n\nProgeria, or premature aging, is a kind of wasting disease that causes a\n\nchild's tissues (including bones) to atrophy, and to change in many of the\n\nways that would normally occur in extreme old age.Recent studies have found that both men and women lose minerals from their\n\nbones at the rate of about 1% per year.  Although men have lower estrogen\n\nin youth than women do, their bones are much heavier.  During aging, as\n\ntheir bones get thinner, men's estrogen levels keep rising.Besides having weaker bones, old people have weaker muscles, and are more\n\nlikely to injure themselves in a fall because their muscles don't react as\n\nwell.  Muscle loss occurs at about the rate of 1% per year.Women's muscles, like their bones, are normally smaller than men's, and\n\nestrogen contributes significantly to these differences.TNF can produce very rapid loss of tissue including bone, and in general,\n\nit rises with aging.  Some of the people who like to say that \"osteoporosis\n\nis caused by estrogen deficiency\" know about the destructive actions of\n\nTNF, and argue that it rises at menopause \"because of estrogen deficiency.\"\n\nThere are very good reasons for rejecting that argument; the experiments\n\nsometimes seem to have been designed purely for propaganda purposes, using\n\ntoxic levels of estrogen for a specific result.One researcher noted that the effects of estrogen on cells in vitro are\n\nbiphasic:  Low doses increased TNF, high doses decreased TNF.  Everyone\n\nknows that unphysiologically high doses (50 or 100 or more times above the\n\nphysiological level of around 0.25 micrograms per liter) of estrogen are\n\ntoxic to cells, producing functional and structural changes, and even rapid\n\ndeath.  So, when a researcher who wants to show estrogen's \"bone\n\nprotective\" effect of lowering TNF adds a lethal dose of estrogen to his\n\ncell culture, he can conclude that \"estrogen inhibits TNF production.\"  But\n\nthe result is no more interesting than the observation that a large dose of\n\ncyanide inhibits breathing.TNF is produced by endotoxin, and estrogen increases the amount of\n\nendotoxin in the blood.  Even without endotoxin, though, estrogen can\n\nstimulate the production of TNF.  Lactic acid and unsaturated fats and\n\nhypoxia can stimulate increased formation of TNF.  Estrogen increases\n\nproduction of nitric oxide systemically, and nitric oxide can stimulate TNF\n\nformation. How does TNF work, to produce tissue damage and wasting? It\n\ncauses cells to take up too much calcium, which makes them hypermetabolic\n\nbefore it kills them.  It increases formation of nitric oxide and carbon\n\nmonoxide, blocking respiration.  TNF can cause a 19.5 fold increased in the\n\nenzyme which produces carbon monoxide (Rizzardini, et al., 1993), which\n\nblocks respiration.All of the normal conditions associated with high estrogen also are found\n\nto involve increased production of TNF, and treatment of animals with\n\nestrogen clearly increases their TNF.  Premature ovarian failure (with low\n\nestrogen levels) leads to reduced TNF, as does treatment with antiestrogens.\n\nIf bone resorption is significantly regulated by TNF, then it should be\n\nconcluded that increased estrogenic influence will tend to produce\n\nosteoporosis.Tamoxifen, which has some estrogenic effects, including the inhibition of\n\nosteoclasts, can kill osteoclasts when the dose is high enough.  The\n\ninhibition of osteoclast activity by either estrogen or tamoxifen is\n\nprobably a toxic action, that has been characterized as \"beneficial\" by the\n\nestrogen industry simply because they didn't have any better argument for\n\ngetting women to use their products.Some types of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, involve a life-long\n\nprocess of degeneration of the brain, with an inflammatory component, that\n\nprobably makes them comparable to osteoporosis and muscle-wasting.  (In the\n\nbrain, the microglia, which are similar to macrophages, and the astrocytes,\n\ncan produce TNF.)  The importance of the inflammatory process in\n\nAlzheimer's disease was appreciated when it was noticed that people who\n\nused aspirin regularly had a low incidence of that dementia.  Aspirin\n\ninhibits the formation of TNF, and aspirin has been found to retard bone loss.\n\nIn the case of osteoporosis (A. Murrillo-Uribe, 1999), as in Alzheimer's\n\ndisease, the incidence is two or three times as high in women as in men.\n\nIn both Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis, the estrogen industry is\n\narguing that the problems are caused by a suddenly developing estrogen\n\ndeficiency, rather than by prolonged exposure to estrogen.Similar arguments were made fifty years ago regarding the nature of the\n\nmenopause itself--that it was caused by a sudden decrease in estrogen\n\nproduction.  The evidence that has accumulated in the last forty years has\n\ndecisively settled that argument:  Menopause is the result of prolonged\n\nexposure to estrogen.  (Even one large dose destroys certain areas in the\n\nbrain, and chronic, natural levels damage the nerves that regulate the\n\npituitary.  Overactivity of the pituitary leads to many other features of\n\naging.)The links between estrogen and TNF appear to be essential factors in aging\n\nand its diseases.  Each of these substances has its constructive, but\n\nlimited, place in normal physiology, but as excitatory factors, they must\n\noperate within the appropriate constraints.  The basic constraint is that\n\nresources, including energy and oxygen, must be available to terminate\n\ntheir excitatory actions.  Adequate oxygen, a generous supply of carbon\n\ndioxide, saturated fats, thyroid, and progesterone restrain TNF, while\n\noptimizing other cytokines and immune functions, including thymic protection. \n\nIn the development of the organism and its adaptive functions, there are\n\npatterned processes, functional systems, that can clarify the interactions\n\nof growth and atrophy.  The respiratory production of energy and carbon\n\ndioxide, and the respiratory defect in which lactic acid is produced,\n\ncorrespond to successful adaptation, and to stressful/excitotoxic\n\nmaladaptation, respectively.  Excitotoxicity, and Meerson's work on the\n\nprotective functions of the antistress hormones, have to be understood in\n\nthis framework.  This framework integrates the understanding of cancer\n\nmetabolism with the other stress metabolisms, and with the metabolism of\n\nnormal growth.Unsaturated fats, iron, and lactic acid are closely related to the actions\n\nand regulation of TNF, and therefore they strongly influence the nature of\n\nstress and the rate of aging.The fact that cancer depends on the presence of polyunsaturated fats\n\nprobably relates to the constructive and destructive actions of TNF:  The\n\ndestructive effects such as multiple organ failure/congestive heart\n\nfailure/shock-lung, etc., apparently involve arachidonic acid and its\n\nmetabolites, which are based on the so-called essential fatty acids.  When\n\noxygen and the correct nutrients are available, the hypermetabolism\n\nproduced by TNF could be reparative (K. Fukushima, et al., 1999), rather\n\nthan destructive.  Stimulation in the presence of oxygen produces carbon\n\ndioxide, allowing cells to excrete calcium and to deposit it in bones, but\n\nstimulation in the absence of oxygen produces lactic acid and causes\n\ncellular calcium uptake.It is in this context that the therapeutic effects of saturated fats,\n\ncarbon dioxide, progesterone, and thyroid can be understood.  They restore\n\nstability to a system that has been stimulated beyond its capacity to adapt\n\nwithout injury.REFERENCESJ Reprod Med 1990 May;35(5):503-7.

        "chunk_html": "Fats and degeneration======================================== 50 \r\nyears ago, in the first phase of marketing the polyunsaturated fatty \r\nacids (PUFA), linoleic acid was heart protective, and the saturated \r\nfats raised cholesterol and caused heart disease. In \r\nthe second phase, the other essential fatty acid, linolenic acid, \r\nwas said to be even better than linoleic acid. In \r\nthe third phase, the longer chain omega -3 (omega minus three, or n \r\nminus three) fatty acids, DHA and EPA, are said to be even better than \r\nlinolenic acid. Along \r\nthe way, the highly unsaturated arachidonic acid, which we and other \r\nanimals make out of the linoleic acid in foods, was coming to be identified \r\nwith the harmful animal fats. But we just didn't hear much about \r\nhow the amount of arachidonic acid in the tissues depended on the amount \r\nof linoleic acid in the diet. U.S. \r\nmarketing dominates the world economy, including of course the communication \r\nmedia, so we shouldn't expect to hear much about the role of PUFA in \r\ncausing cancer, diabetes, obesity, aging, thrombosis, arthritis and \r\nimmunodeficiency, or to hear about the benefits of the saturated fats. The \r\nsaturated fats include the tropical fats, because they are synthesized \r\nin very warm organisms, and are very stable at those temperatures. Their \r\nstability offers some protection against the unstable PUFA. Several \r\nof the degenerative conditions produced by the essential fatty acids \r\ncan be reversed by use of saturated fats, varying in length from the \r\nshort chains of coconut oil to the very long chains of waxes. When \r\na person uses a drug, there is generally an awareness that the benefit \r\nhas to be weighed against the side effects. But if something is treated \r\nas a nutrient, especially an essential nutrient, there is \r\nan implication that it won't produce undesirable side effects. Over \r\nthe last thirty years I have asked several prominent oil researchers \r\nwhat the evidence is that there is such a thing as an essential fatty \r\nacid. One professor cited a single publication about a solitary sick \r\nperson who recovered from some sickness after being given some unsaturated \r\nfat. (If he had known of any better evidence, wouldn't he have mentioned \r\nit?) The others (if they answered at all) cited Burr and Burr, 1929 The surprising \r\nthing about that answer is that these people can consider any nutritional \r\nresearch from 1929 to be definitive. It's very much like quoting a 1929 \r\nopinion of a physicist regarding the procedure for making a hydrogen \r\nbomb. What was known about nutrition in 1929? Most of the B vitamins \r\nweren't even suspected, and it had been only two or three years since \r\nvitamin B had been subdivided into two factors, the antineuritic \r\nfactor, B1, and the growth factor, B2. \r\nBurr had no way of really understanding what deficiencies or toxicities \r\nwere present in his experimental diet. A \r\nfew years after the first experiments, Burr put one of his essential \r\nfatty acid deficient rats under a bell jar to measure its metabolic \r\nrate, and found that the deficient animals were metabolizing 50% faster \r\nthan rats that were given linoleic and linolenic acids as part of their \r\ndiet. That was an important observation, but Burr didn't understand \r\nits implications. Later, many experiments showed that the polyunsaturated \r\nfats slowed metabolism by profoundly interfering with the function of \r\nthe thyroid hormone and the cellular respiratory apparatus. Without \r\nthe toxic fats, respiratory energy metabolism was very intense, and \r\na diet that was nutritionally sufficient for a sluggish animal wouldn't \r\nnecessarily be adequate for the vigorous animals. Several \r\npublications between 1936 and 1944 made it very clear that Burr's basic \r\nanimal diet was deficient in various nutrients, especially vitamin B6.The disease that appeared in Burr's animals could be cured by fat free \r\nB-vitamin preparations, or by purified vitamin B6 when it became available.A zinc deficiency produces similar symptoms,and at the time Burr did his experiments, there was no information on \r\nthe effects of fats on mineral absorption.  If a diet is barely \r\nadequate in the essential minerals, increasing the metabolic rate, or \r\ndecreasing intestinal absorption of minerals, will produce mineral deficiencies \r\nand metabolic problems. Although \r\nBurr's disease clearly turned out to be a B-vitamin deficiency, \r\nprobably combined with a mineral  deficiency, it continues to be \r\ncited as the basis justifying the multibillion dollar industry that \r\nhas grown up around the essential oils. Two \r\nyears before Burr's experiment, German researchers found that a fat-free \r\ndiet prevented almost all spontaneous cancers in rats. Later work showed \r\nthat the polyunsaturated fats both initiate and promote cancer. With \r\nthat knowledge, the people who kept claiming that linoleic, linolenic, \r\nand maybe arachidonic acid are the essential fatty acids, should \r\nhave devoted some effort to finding out how much of that essential \r\nnutrient was enough, so that people could minimize their consumption \r\nof the carcinogenic stuff. Between \r\nthe first and second world wars, cod liver oil was recommended as a \r\nvitamin supplement, at first as a source of vitamin A, and later as \r\na source of vitamins A and D. But in the late 1940s, experimenters used \r\nit as the main fat in dogs' diet, and found that they all died from \r\ncancer, while the dogs on a standard diet had only a 5% cancer mortality. \r\nThat sort of information, and the availability of synthetic vitamins, \r\nled to the decreased use of cod liver oil. But \r\naround that time, the seed oil industry was in crisis because the use \r\nof those oils in paints and plastics was being displaced by new compounds \r\nmade from petroleum. The industry needed new markets, and discovered \r\nways to convince the public that seed oils were better than animal fats. \r\nThey were called the heart protective oils, though human studies \r\nsoon showed the same results that the animal studies had, namely, that \r\nthey were toxic to the heart and increased the incidence of cancer. The \r\nlipid hypothesis of heart disease argued that cholesterol in the \r\nblood caused atherosclerosis, and that the polyunsaturated oils lowered \r\nthe amount of cholesterol in the blood. Leaving behind the concept of \r\nnutritional essentiality, this allowed the industry (and their academic \r\nsupporters, such as Frederick Stare at Harvard) to begin promoting the \r\noils as having drug-like therapeutic properties. Larger amounts of polyunsaturated \r\nfat were supposed to be more protective by lowering the cholesterol, \r\nand were to be substituted for the saturated fats, which supposedly \r\nraised cholesterol and increased heart disease, producing atherosclerotic \r\nplaques in the blood vessels and increasing the formation of blood clots. Since \r\nall ordinary foods contain significant amounts of the polyunsaturated \r\nfats, there was no reason to think that, even if they were essential \r\nnutrients, people were likely to become deficient in them. So the idea \r\nof treating the seed oils as drug-like substances, to be taken in large \r\namounts, appealed to the food oil industry. Prostaglandins, \r\nwhich are produced in the body by oxidizing the polyunsaturated fatty \r\nacids, provided an opportunity for the drug industry to get involved \r\nin a new market, andthe prostaglandins offered a new way of arguing \r\nfor the nutritional essentiality of linoleic and related acids: A whole \r\nsystem of hormones is made from these molecules.Since some \r\nof the prostaglandins suppress immunity, cause inflammation and promote \r\ncancer growth, some people have divided them into the good prostaglandins \r\nand the bad prostaglandins. PGI2, \r\nor prostacyclin, is considered to be a good prostaglandin, because it \r\ncauses vasodilatation, and so drug companies have made their own synthetic \r\nequivalents: Epoprostenol, \r\niloprost, taprostene, ciprostene, UT-15, beraprost, and cicaprost. Some \r\nof these are being investigated for possible use in killing cancer. But \r\nmany very useful drugs that already existed, including cortisol and \r\naspirin, were found to achieve some of their most important effects \r\nby inhibiting the formation of the prostaglandins. It was the body's \r\nload of polyunsaturated fats which made it very susceptible to inflammation, \r\nstress, trauma, infection, radiation, hormone imbalance, and other fundamental \r\nproblems, and drugs like aspirin and cortisone, which limit the activation \r\nof the stored essential fatty acids, gain their remarkable range \r\nof beneficial effects partly by the restraint they impose on those stored \r\ntoxins. Increasingly, \r\nthe liberation of arachidonic acid from tissues during stress is seen \r\nas a central factor in all forms of stress, either acute (as in burns \r\nor exercise) or chronic (as in diabetes or aging). And, as the fat stores \r\nbecome more toxic, it seems that they more readily liberate the free \r\nfatty acids. (For example, see Iritani, et al., 1984) During \r\nthis same period, a few experimenters were finding that animals which \r\nwere fed a diet lacking the essential fatty acids had some remarkable \r\nproperties:They consumed oxygen and calories at a very high \r\nrate, their mitochondria were unusually tough and stable, their tissues \r\ncould be transplanted into other animals without provoking immunological \r\nrejection, and they were very hard to kill by trauma and a wide variety \r\nof toxins that easily provoke lethal shock in animals on the usual diet. \r\nAs the Germans had seen in 1927, they had a low susceptibility to cancer, \r\nand new studies were showing that they weren't susceptible to various \r\nfibrotic conditions, including alcoholic liver cirrhosis. In \r\n1967 a major nutrition publication,Present Knowledge in Nutrition,published Hartroft and Porta's observation that the age pigment, \r\nlipofuscin, was formed in proportion to the amount of polyunsaturated \r\nfat and oxidants in the diet. The new interest in organ transplantation \r\nled to the discovery that the polyunsaturated fats prolonged graft survival, \r\nby suppressing the immune system. Immunosuppression was considered to \r\nhave a role in the carcinogenicity of the essential fatty acids. Around \r\nthe same time, there were studies that showed that unsaturated fats \r\nretarded brain development and produced obesity. Substances \r\nvery much like the prostaglandins, called isoprostanes and neuroprostanes, \r\nare formed spontaneously from highly unsaturated fatty acids, and are \r\nuseful as indicators of the rate of lipid peroxidation in the body. \r\nMost of the products of lipid peroxidation are toxic, as a result of \r\ntheir reactions with proteins, DNA, and the mitochondria. The age-related \r\nglycation products that are usually blamed on sugar, are largely the \r\nresult of peroxidation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids. Through \r\nthe 1970s, this sort of information about the harmful effects of the \r\nPUFA was being slowly assimilated by the culture, though many dietitians \r\nstill spoke of the essential fatty acids, vitamin F. By 1980, \r\nit looked as though responsible researchers would see the promotion \r\nof cancer, heart disease, mitochondrial damage, hypothyroidism and immunosuppression \r\ncaused by the polyunsaturated fats as their most important feature, \r\nand would see that there had never been a basis for believing that they \r\nwere essential nutrients. But \r\nthen, without acknowledging that there had been a problem with the doctrine \r\nof essentiality, fat researchers just started changing the subject, \r\nshifting the public discourse to safer, more profitable topics. The \r\nfats that had been called essential, but that had so many toxic effects, \r\nwere no longer emphasized, and the failed idea of essentiality \r\nwas shifted to different categories of polyunsaturated fats. The \r\naddition of the long chain highly unsaturated fats to baby food formulas \r\nwas recently approved, on the basis of their supposed essentiality \r\nfor brain development. One of the newer arguments for the essentiality \r\nof the PUFA is that they are needed for making cell membranes. \r\nBut human cells can grow and divide in artificial culture solutions \r\nwhich contain none of the polyunsaturated fats, and no one has claimed \r\nthat they are growing without membranes. The \r\nlong chain fats found in fish and some algae don't interfere with animal \r\nenzymes as strongly as the seed oils do, and so by comparison, they \r\naren't so harmful. They are also so unstable that relatively little \r\nof them is stored in the tissues. (And when they are used as food additives, \r\nit's necessary to use antioxidants to keep them from becoming smelly \r\nand acutely toxic.) When \r\nmeat is grilled at a high temperature, the normally spaced double bonds \r\nin PUFA migrate towards each other, becoming more stable, so that linoleic \r\nacid is turned into conjugated linoleic acid. This analog of the \r\nessential linoleic acid competes against the linoleic acid in \r\ntissues, and protects against cancer, atherosclerosis, inflammation \r\nand other effects of the normal PUFA. Presumably, anything which interferes \r\nwith the essential fatty acids is protective, when the organism contains \r\ndangerous amounts of PUFA. Even the trans-isomers of the unsaturated \r\nfatty acids (found in butterfat, and convertible into conjugated linoleic \r\nacid) can be protective against cancer. In \r\nthe 1980s the oil promoters were becoming more sophisticated, and were \r\npublishing many experiments in which the fish oils were compared with \r\ncorn oil, or safflower, or soy oil, and in many of those experiments, \r\nthe animals' health was better when they didn't eat the very toxic seed \r\noils, that contained the essential fatty acids, linoleic and linoleic \r\nacids. Besides \r\ncomparing the fish oils to the stronger toxins, another trick is to \r\ntake advantage of the same immunosuppressive property that had seemed \r\ntroublesome, and to emphasize their ability to temporarily alleviate \r\nsome autoimmune or allergic diseases. X-rays were once used that way, \r\nto treat arthritis and ringworm, for example. And, \r\nknowing that cancer cells have the ability to consume large amounts \r\nof fatty acids, they would test these fats in tissue culture dishes, \r\nand demonstrate that they were poisonous, cytotoxic, to the fast growing \r\ncancer cells. Although they caused cancer in animals, if they could \r\nbe shown to kill cancer cells in a dish, they could be sold as anticancer \r\ndrugs/nutrients, with the special mystique of being essential fatty \r\nacids. Strangely, their ability to kill cancer cells under some circumstances \r\nand to suppress some immunological reactions is being promoted in close \r\nassociation with the doctrine that these fats are nutritionally essential. Arachidonic \r\nacid is made from linoleic acid, and so those two oils were considered \r\nas roughly equivalent in their ability to meet our nutritional needs, \r\nbut a large part of current research is devoted to showing the details \r\nof how fish oils protect against arachidonic acid. The balance \r\nbetween the omega -3 and the omega -6 fatty acids is increasingly being \r\npresented as a defense against the toxic omega -6 fats. But the accumulation \r\nof unsaturated fats with aging makes any defense increasingly difficult, \r\nand the extreme instability of the highly unsaturated omega -3 fats \r\ncreates additional problems. PUFA \r\nand x-rays have many biological effects in common. They are immunosuppressive, \r\nbut they produce their own inflammatory reactions, starting with increased \r\npermeability of capillaries, disturbed coagulation and proteolysis, \r\nand producing fibrosis and tumefaction or tissue atrophy. This isn't \r\njust a coincidence, since ionizing radiation attacks the highly unstable \r\npolyunsaturated molecules, simply accelerating processes that ordinarily \r\nhappen more slowly as a result of stress and aging. Prolonged \r\nstress eventually tends to be a self-sustaining process, impairing the \r\nefficient respiratory production of energy, converting muscle tissue \r\nto amino acids, suppressing the thyroid, and activating further mobilization \r\nof fatty acids. Fatty acids are mobilized from within the structure \r\nof cells by phospholipases, and from fat tissues by other lipases. The \r\nhighly unsaturated fatty acids, as well as the ordinary essential \r\nfatty acids, act directly to increase capillary permeability, even \r\nwithout conversion into prostaglandins, and they interfere in many ways \r\nwith the clotting and clot removal systems. The effects of PUFA taken \r\nin a meal probably disturb the clotting system more than the same quantity \r\nof saturated fat, contrary to many of the older publications. The PUFA \r\nare widely believed to prevent clotting, but when cod liver oil is given \r\nto EFA deficient animals, it activates the formation of clots \r\n(Hornstra, et al., 1989). An opposite effect is seen when a long chain \r\nfatty acid synergizes with aspirin, to restrain clotting (Molina, et \r\nal., 2003). Fibrosis \r\nis a generalized consequence of the abnormal capillary permeability \r\nproduced by things that disrupt the clotting system. Estrogen, with \r\nits known contribution to the formation of blood clots and edema and \r\nfibrosis and tumors, achieves part of its effect by maintaining a chronically \r\nhigh level of free fatty acids, preferentially liberating arachidonic \r\nacid, rather than saturated fatty acids. Butter, \r\nbeef fat, and lamb fat are the only mostly saturated fats produced on \r\na large scale in the U.S., and the cheapness/profitability of the seed \r\noils made it easy to displace them. But, in the face of the immense \r\namount of propagandistic health claims that have been made against \r\nthe saturated fats, it's instructive to look at some of their actual \r\neffects, especially on the clotting system, and the related fibrotic \r\nreactions. The \r\nsaturated fatty acids are very unreactive chemically. Coconut oil, despite \r\ncontaining about 1% of the unstable PUFA, can be left in a bucket at \r\nroom temperature for a year or more without showing any evidence of \r\ndeterioration, suggesting that the predominance of saturated fat acts \r\nas an antioxidant for the unsaturated molecules. In the body, the saturated \r\nfats seem to act the same way, preventing or even reversing many of \r\nthe conditions caused by oxidation of fats. The \r\nstress-induced liberation of arachidonic acid causes blood vessels to \r\nleak, and this allows fibrin to escape from the blood stream, into the \r\nbasement membrane and beyond into the extracellular matrix, where it \r\nproduces fibrosis. (Cancer, autoimmune diseases, and heart disease involve \r\nthe same inflammatory, thrombotic, fibrotic processes as the nominal \r\nfibroses.) Scleroderma, liver cirrhosis, fibrosis of the lungs, heart, \r\nand other organs, and all the diseases in which fibrous tissue becomes \r\ndense and progressively contracts, involve similar processes, and the \r\ntreatments which are successful are those that stop the inflammation \r\nproduced by the oxidation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids. Retroperitoneal \r\nfibrosis is now known to be produced by estrogen, and is treated by \r\nantiestrogenic and antiserotonergic drugs, but as early as 1940 Alejandro \r\nLipschutz demonstrated that chronic exposure to very low doses of estrogen \r\nproduced fibromas in essentially every part of the body. Earlier, Loeb \r\nhad studied the action of large doses of estrogen, which produced fibrosis \r\nof the uterus, as if it had accelerated aging. Following Lipschutz' \r\nwork, in which he demonstrated the antifibromatogenic actions \r\nof pregnenolone and progesterone, several Argentine researchers showed \r\nthat progesterone prevented and cured abdominal adhesions and other \r\nfibrotic conditions, including retroperitoneal fibrosis. Since \r\nestrogen produces both leakiness of the capillaries and excessive formation \r\nof fibrin, its effects will be seen first in the organs where it concentrates, \r\nbut eventually anywhere capillaries leak fibrin. Estrogen activates \r\nthe phospholipase which liberates arachidonic acid, and progesterone \r\ninhibits that phospholipase. As \r\nthe fat tissues become more burdened with arachidonic acid, they release \r\nit more easily in response to moderately lipolytic stress signals. This \r\ncould explain the increased levels of free fatty acids and lipid peroxidation \r\nthat occur with aging. In animals that are deficient in the polyunsaturated \r\nfatty acids, adrenalin doesn't have the lipolytic effect that it does \r\nin animals on the standard diet. With aging, there is not only a tendency \r\nto have chronically higher free fatty acids in the blood, but for those \r\nfatty acids to be more unsaturated. The phospholipids of mitochondria \r\nand microsomes become more unsaturated with aging (Laganiere and Yu, \r\n1993, Lee, et al., 1999). In the human retina there is a similar accumulation \r\nof PUFA with aging (Nourooz-Zadeh and Pereira, 1999), which implies \r\nthat the aged retina will be more easily damaged by light. Several \r\nstudies suggest that a high degree of unsaturation in the fats is fundamentally \r\nrelated to the aging process, since long lived species have a lower \r\ndegree of unsaturation in their fats. Caloric restriction decreases \r\nthe age-related accumulation of the fatty acids with 4 and 5 double \r\nbonds. Although \r\npublicity has emphasized the anti-inflammatory effects of fish oil, \r\nexperiments show that it is extremely effective in producing alcohol-related \r\nliver cirrhosis. Breakdown products of polyunsaturated fats (isoprostanes \r\nand 4-HNE) are found in the blood of people with alcoholic liver disease \r\n(Aleynik, et al., 1998). In the absence of polyunsaturated fats, alcohol \r\ndoesn't produce cirrhosis. Saturated fats allow the fibrosis to regress: A \r\ndiet enriched in saturated fatty acids effectively reverses alcohol-induced \r\nnecrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis despite continued alcohol consumption. \r\nThe therapeutic effects of saturated fatty acids may be explained, at \r\nleast in part, by reduced endotoxemia and lipid peroxidation.... \r\n(Nanji, et al., 1995, 2001) In \r\nthese studies, the animals were switched from fish oil to either palm \r\noil or medium chain triglycerides (a major fraction of coconut oil). \r\nIn other studies, Knittel, et al. (1995), show that fibrinogen, in a \r\nclotting-like process, is involved in the development of liver fibrosis, \r\nand that this appears to provide a basis for the growth of additional \r\nextracellular matrix. Brown, \r\net al. (1989), discussed this developmental process (leaky capillaries, \r\nfibrosis) in relation to wound healing, lung disease, and tumor growth. The \r\nrelatively few studies of fish oil and linoleic acid that compare them \r\nwith palmitic acid or coconut oil have produced some very important \r\nresults. For example, pigs exposed to endotoxin developed severe lung \r\nproblems (resembling shock lung) when they had been on a diet \r\nwith either fish oil or Intralipid (which is mostly linoleic acid, used \r\nfor intravenous feeding in hospitals), but not after palmitic acid (Wolfe, \r\net al., 2002). Eating \r\nlow-fat seafood (sole, whitefish, turbot, scallops, oysters, lobster, \r\nshrimp, squid, etc.) once in a while can provide useful trace minerals, \r\nwithout much risk. However, fish from some parts of the ocean contain \r\nindustrial contaminants in the fat, and large fish such as tuna, swordfish, \r\nChilean sea bass and halibut contain toxic amounts of mercury in the \r\nmuscles. Chilean sea bass (Patagonian toothfish) is very high in fat, \r\ntoo. About \r\nten years ago I met a young man with a degenerative brain disease, and \r\nwas interested in the fact that he (working on a fishing boat) had been \r\neating almost a pound of salmon per day for several years. There is \r\nnow enough information regarding the neurotoxic effects of fish oil \r\nto justify avoidance of the fatty fish. Some \r\nof the current advertising is promoting fish oil to prevent cancer, \r\nso it's important to remember that there are many studies showing that \r\nit increases cancer. The \r\ndevelopmental and physiological significance of the type of fatty acid \r\nin the diet has been established for a long time, but cultural stereotypes \r\nand commercial interests are threatened by it, so it can't be discussed \r\npublicly.

In California, \nmany seals die with an unusual form of metastatic cancer.  Seals are \nhighly contaminated with industrial dioxins.In Africa, aflatoxin is strongly associated with immunodeficiency.  In \nanimals, both dioxin and aflatoxin activate the expression of viruses.Endometriosis is stimulated by dioxins.  Environmental estrogens affect \nthe immune system.It has been over ten years since I wrote about \"AIDS\" (e.g., \n\"Repairing the Immune System,\" inCofactors in AIDS and \nHIV infection,edited by R.R. Watson, l989) and the official doctrine \nthat it is caused by the \"HIV\" virus still hasn't been supported \nby anything that resembles real science. Duesberg's arguments have never \nbeen answered (except by bureaucratic thuggery).In 1989 I pointed out that septicemia, blood stream infection, in young \nadults, which used to be a rare thing, and which indicates defective \nimmunity, has been increasing in a remarkably continuous way since the \nlate 1940s, and I reviewed the many things in our environment that are \nknown to suppress immunity, and whichhave become increasingly prevalent in ourenvironment--unsaturated vegetable oils, ferrous iron and carrageenan \nin our foods, lead in air, food, and water, exposure to medical, military, \nand industrial ionizing radiation, vaccinations, pesticides, chlorinated \nhydrocarbons, nitric oxide (smog and medications) and oral contraceptives \nand environmental estrogens, in particular.Of these factors, only \nradiation and lead exposure have decreased in the last several years, \nafter several decades of rapid increase.  The widespread use of diuretics \nin pregnancy, which began in the 1950s and contributed to an epidemic \nof premature births, also declined after the late 1960s. Most of these \nenvironmental factors damage the thymus gland, which regulates the immune \nsystem, and by acting on the thymus their effects tend to be additive \nwith other immunosuppressive factors, including cancer, traumatic injury, \ninflammation, toxins in spoiled food (e.g., aflatoxins) and malnutrition.Cancer, AIDS, and extreme hypothyroidism have several features in common--they \ncause tissue loss and organ damage, with immunodeficiency and intense \nactivation of the stress hormones, including cortisol.  In cancer and \nAIDS, a good case has been made for the primacy of stress-induced wasting \nas the main cause of death.  Whatever one might believe to be the cause \nof cancer and AIDS, it is always good for the patient to prevent tissue \ndamage from the stress associated with the sickness.  Since the stress \nhormones primarily destroy tissues by the activation of specific proteases, \nthe use of protease inhibitors for treating AIDS could conceivably be \naffecting the stress response.  However, the body's normal protection \nagainst the cortisol-activated proteases is centered on the protective \nhormones, progesterone, thyroid, and the androgens.Environmental stressOne of the most broadly substantiated principles in biology is that \na great variety of harmful causes all lead to a few forms of biological \nharm--the concept of the stress reaction shows the powerful implications \nof the principle.  Stress, no matter what the specific cause, has a particularly \ndestructive effect on three organ systems:The nervous system, the immune system, and the reproductive system.  \nInflammation, lipid peroxidation, tissue atrophy, the \"calcium \ncatastrophe\" (when almost anything goes wrong, calcium can transmit \nand amplify and extend the problem, but isn't itself the source of the \nproblem), mitochondrial decay, and similar events help to define the \nstress reaction in greater detail.Hans Selye showed that the thymus shrinks very early in the stress reaction.  \nIn his understanding of the process, when adaptation was followed by \nthe \"exhaustion phase,\" the adrenal glands had simply become \nexhausted from overuse.  F. Z. Meerson's work showed that cortisol, and \nthe free fatty acids mobilized by stress, have a toxic influence on \nthe mitochondrial energy production system.  Both cortisol and the free \nfatty acids block the efficient use of glucose for producing energy, \ncreating a diabetes-like condition.  The exhaustion problem caused by \nexcessive stress is generalized, not just a matter of adrenal insufficiency.Meerson's work created the basis for undersanding several degenerative \nprocesses, especially the phenomenon of \"excitotoxicity,\" \nin which the combination of excessive stimulation and deficient energy \nsupply damages or kills cells.Selye believed that some hormones are antagonistic to each other.  A \nfew of the oppositions that he identified have been thoroughly researched, \nespecially the catabolic/anabolic functions of glucocorticoids and androgens, \nand the shock/antishock functions of estrogen and progesterone, respectively.Puberty, because of hormonal changes, especially increased estrogen, \ncan be seen as the first stage of a chronic stress, resembling diabetes, \nsince elevated free fatty acids cause \"insulin resistance,\" \nwith slightly impaired oxidation of glucose.  The thymus shrinks considerably \nat puberty, under the influence of the hormonal changes and the increased \nfree fatty acids (caused mainly by estrogen).  The degenerative diseases \ncan be seen as the cumulative result of stress, in which tissue damage \nresults from the diabetes-like impairment of energy production.The thymus, and the thymus-dependent areas of the spleen, are required \nfor full and subtle control of immunity.  In the absence of thymic control, \nthe B cells are still able to produce antibodies, but they are more \nlikely to produce autoantibodies.Stress produces a variety of cellular changes, including the production \nof the \"shock proteins.\"  These proteins can make up 20% of \nthe cell's total protein content.  In themselves, the shock proteins \nare immunosuppressive.  They can be recognized by the immune system as \nantigens, and so are a factor in the appearance of \"autoimmune\" \nantibodies.  The autoantibodies themselves are often blamed for the diseases \nthey are sometimes associated with, but since they can be present (for \nexample, following removal of the spleen) in people who have no symptoms, \ntheir function is probably to facilitate the removal of tissues which \nare defective for some other reason.  The shock proteins could be one \nof the signals that activate the immune system to remove damaged tissue, \nand they might be involved in the removal of senescent cells, though \nI don't think any experiments have been done to test this idea.Besides activating the cells to produce massive amounts of the shock \nproteins, stress can also activate the so-called hormone receptors, \nsuch as estrogen receptors, even in the absence of the hormones.  Stress \nalso activates the endonucleases, which cut sections out of the DNA \nmolecules, and activates mobile genetic elements, producing genetic \ninstability.  Like cortisol and estrogen, stress itself activates integrated \nretroviruses.  The \"endogenous retroviruses\" make up nearly \n10% of the human genome, and many of them locate themselves in regulatory \nsites in the chromosomes.Since stress lowers the discriminatory ability of the immune system, \nand stimulates the expression of retroviruses, the antibodies sometimes \nseen in association with immunodeficiency may be similar to the various \nautoantibodies that are also produced by stress.People who have autoimmune diseases such as lupus and Sjogrens syndrome \n(which are promoted by estrogen:Ahmed and Talal) have antibodies \nwhich sometimes react positively in the AIDS test, and searches for \nthe HIV virus in such people have found no evidence of it. (Nelson, \net al., 1994;Deas, et al., 1998.)  Treatments for roundworms \nand other parasites cause antibodies to retroviruses to appear in animals \nthat previously tested negative;this might account for the high \nrates of positive tests for HIV in areas such as Africa in which treatment \nfor filiariasis is common (Kitchen and Cotter, 1988).Organisms are most sensitive to environmental damage early in life, \nespecially prenatally.  This is the period in which normal hormone exposure \nmasculinizes the brain, for example.  The term \"imprinting\" \nrefers to the extreme responsiveness of the organism at this time, and \nit has been extended to include long lasting influences which may result \nfrom abnormally high or low levels of natural substances, or from the \npresence of other, abnormal substances during the sensitive period.  \nThe effects of early \"imprinting\" can cause permanently altered \nsensitivities.  In animal studies, L. C. Strong showed that prenatal \ninfluences determine the age at which puberty and reproductive senescence \noccur.  In humans, premature birth, a powerful stressor, is associated \nwith premature puberty.  The thymus is damaged both by premature birth \nand by puberty.  The effects of damage early in life will increase vulnerability \nin subsequent decades.When babies are imprinted by the mother's disturbed hormones, or by \ndiuretics, by milk substitutes, or by industrial effluents, the worst \neffects are likely to be seen decades later, or even generations later.  \nA similar long-range effect can be produced by nutritional deficiencies.Although more mature organisms are less sensitive to stress, both early \nimprinting, and the cumulative effects of exposure, will cause some \nindividuals to be much more sensitive than others, and aging itself \nincreases vulnerability.If the present epidemic of immunodeficiency is produced by environmental \nstress, then we should expect to see a variety of other stress-related \ndiseases increasing at roughly the same time.  When a stressor is acting \nthrough imprinting, then the harmful effects may not be seen until 20 \nor 30 years later, but when the stressor has acute and immediate effects, \nthe effects should rise and fall at roughly the same time as the environmental \ncause.The rise of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome during the last 50 \nyears hasn't been the only health problem that has grown rapidly during \nthat time.  The \"flesh eating bacteria,\" causing necrotizing \nfasciitis and related conditions, should probably be classed along with \nsepticemia/bacteremia as the consequence of a weakened immune system, \nbut there are many other diseases that have followed a similar pattern, \nwhich might be caused by the same factors which are causing immunodeficiency.Thyroid diseases (mostly in women), some autoimmune diseases including \nprimary biliary cirrhosis (mostly in women) and inflammatory bowel disease, \nliver cancer, diabetes (doubling in children since 1949), prostate cancer, \ndecreased sperm counts, premature births and birth defects, minimal \nbrain dysfunction-attention deficit-hyperactivity, cerebral palsy, premature \npuberty (which is associated with premature birth), congestive heart \nfailure, osteoporosis (independently of the changing age-structure of \nthe population), depression (most common in women, more than doubling \namong children in recent decades), and multiple sclerosis have increased \nin prevalence during this period.Some of these conditions \nare strongly associated with each other, for example, primary biliary \ncirrhosis, breast cancer, and osteoporosis.It is common knowledge, among people who study immunity, that radiation, \npolyunsaturated fatty acids, estrogens, and dioxins are toxic to the \nthymus gland, and can produce immuno-deficiency.  They mimic or accelerate \nthe thymic atrophy of aging, causing a deficient thymus-dependent immune \nresponse, usually without harming the ability of B cells to produce \nantibodies.  There are probably many examples of damage to immune systems, \nbesides immunodeficiency, caused by these agents.  Slight damage to the \nimmune system, such as can be produced by hypoglycemia or other energy \ndeficit--creates an exaggerated inflammatory response, and the release \nof the mediators of inflammation, including histamine, serotonin, and \nprostaglandins, activates the stress hormone system, leading to further \nbiological damage.  Liver disease and several other \"autoimmune\" \ndiseases involve abnormal immune responses, probably including thymic \ndeficiency and an intensified inflammatory response.  The fact that livers \ntransplanted from female donors to male recipients are less successful \nthan are livers from male donor transplanted into female recipients, \nis consistent with the idea that autoantibodies (which are far more \ncommon in women than in men) are a relatively harmless response to changes \nin the organs themselves.Are antiviral therapies working?  Ivan Ilich, inMedical Nemesis,showed that historically, many diseases have had characteristic incidence \ncurves, rising to a maximum, and then falling away to relative insignificance, \nindependently of what people were doing as treatment or prevention.  \nAs susceptible people are exposed to conditions that cause a disease, \nthey will get sick, and then either die or develop resistance.  The conditions \nwhich at first caused increasing disease incidence, will eventually \ntend to affect only children who haven't developed resistance.If AIDS mortality rose rapidly to a peak a few years ago, and then began \nfalling, we should ask whether this pattern fits that of other diseases \ndiscussed by Ilich.  Looking for causes other than the virus, we might \nfind a parallel in the rise and fall of some other factor.In the 1950s, new diuretics came on the market, and millions of pregnant \nwomen took them.  It was predicted that there would be an epidemic of \nbrain damage as a result, and in fact the incidence of hyperactivity, \nattention-deficit, and other \"minimal\" brain damage disorders \ndid rise during those years.  After about 15-20 years, experiences such \nas the Thalidomide episode caused physicians to temper their enthusiasm \nfor the use of drugs during pregnancy.The incidence of low birth-weight \nbabies in the U.S. peaked around 1965, and 28 years later AIDS mortality \nin the US peaked.The rising curve had followed both the increase \nin radioactive fallout from atmospheric testing of large numbers of \natomic bombs up to 1963, and the intense promotion of the new diuretics \nbeginning in the early 1950s.  The peak in AIDS mortality in 1993 came \nten or twelve years after the long decline in SAT scores had stopped. \n(The most extreme declines in SAT scores had occurred among the brightest \nstudents, disproving the contention that the average score fell simply \nbecause more students were taking the tests.)  The same prenatal damage \nwhich caused the extreme decline in SAT scores 18 years later (when \nthe damaged babies reached that age) would have left many of the same \nindividuals with weakened immune systems, which would fail prematurely, \nbut at varying intervals, depending on the exposure to other factors.The use of unleaded gasoline increased into the 1990s, and there was \na corresponding decrease in tissue lead content, reflecting the smaller \namount of lead being put into the environment.  According to some reports, \nmedical and dental x-ray exposures were declining during this period. \nYet other factors, including dioxins and unsaturated dietary fats, were \nprobably increasing.Although the new protease inhibitors wouldn't be used until years after \nthe AIDS mortality had begun falling, the government and drug companies \nare claiming that it is the drugs which are decreasing the mortality.A  SynthesisMany things in our environment are increasing the incidence of certain \nkinds of liver disease.  The liver processes things that are ingested \nor that enter the blood stream after being inhaled or absorbed through \nthe skin, so in a toxic environment it is susceptible to injury.  If \ndeprived of good nutrition or adequate thyroid hormone it is especially \nsensitive to toxins.  The body's own estrogen is a burden on the liver, \ncausing women's livers to be on average slower than men's in processing \nenviornmental chemicals.Almost any kind of toxin causes the liver to be less efficient at excreting \nother substances, including hormones.  In malnutrition, sickness, and \nin aging, there is a tendency for higher levels of estrogen to remain \ncirculating in the blood.Natural estrogen, and environmental substances that act like estrogen, \nact as excitants in many types of cell, and at the same time, reduce \nthe efficiency of energy production.  Both of these properties relate \nto its known ability to activate the adrenal glands.  A. L. Soderwall, \nwho was my thesis adviser at the University of Oregon, found that estrogen \ncaused hamsters' adrenal glands to enlarge, and that larger doses overstimulated \nthe glands sufficiently to cause tissue damage.  It is now known that \nestrogen acts directly on the adrenal cells to stimulate cortisol production, \nand that it also stimulates the pituitary to produce more adrenocorticotropin \n(ACTH), which also stimulates the adrenals;estrogen's effect is to impair the negative feedback, in which cortisol \nnormally shuts down ACTH production.  This impaired feedback is characteristic \nof aging.Estrogen directly causes the thymus gland to atrophy, and several of \nits effects, such as increased adrenal activity and elevated free fatty \nacids, also contribute to the shrinkage of the thymus and the inhibition \nof its functions.  While this is happening, the B cells, which normally \nare under the control of the thymus cells, are not killed by estrogen, \nand actually seem to be stimulated by estrogen to produce certain types \nof antibodies.  This combination of effects, weakening the thymus and \nstimulating antibody production, is thought to contribute to the development \nof autoimmune diseases.  Estrogen also stimulates mast cells and similar \ncells to release histamine and other promoters of inflammation, and \nthese effects are probably closer to the actual problem in the autoimmune \ndiseases.  Several of the substances formed under the influence of estrogen \ninterfere with energy production and contribute to cellular excitation, \ncausing tissue injury.Cortisol also stimulates antibody production while suppressing thymic \nimmunity (Norbiato, et al., 1997).Estrogen and stress cause increased levels of free fatty acids to circulate.  \nThe polyunsaturated fatty acids are immunosuppressive, antithyroid, \ndiabetogenic, inhibit respiration, and promote the actions of estrogen \nand cortisol.People suffering from AIDS have been found to have increased estrogen, \nwith high cortisol and ACTH, and very low T3.  (Unfortunately, some researchers \nand the editors who publish their ideas, conclude that the hormones \ndon't cause the stress and wasting symtpoms, because they call thyroid \na \"catabolic hormone,\" and because they describe the fatigue \nand sodium deficiency as evidence of \"deficiency of cortisol.\"  \nSuch is the state of the research establishment.)In animal experiments, and a few human tests, the HIV and similar viruses \nhave produced effects that could plausibly explain some of the conditions \nseen in AIDS, such as damage to brain cells (C. Pert, R. Sapolsky), \nand altered steroid secretion.  But this is real science, that promises \nto link up with information about stress, aging, allergy, and biological \nadaptability.For example, Sapolsky's group (Brooke, et al., 1998) found that the \nnerve toxicity caused by a viral protein (called gp120) synergizes with \nglucocorticoid toxicity, lowering the ATP level and inhibiting mitochondrial \nfunction, and that simply supplying the nerve with additional energy \nprotects it from destruction.  In other words, the viral peptide just \nincreases excitotoxicity.Another group (Amirhessami-Aghili and Spector, 1991) found that the \npresence of the virus can decrease the production of progesterone.  Since \nprogesterone blocks (Lee, et al., 1997) the expression (and transmission) \nof the virus, this suggests how the overgrowth of the virus might be \ntriggered by stress--once progesterone synthesis falls, a vicious circle \ncould get started.Lee, et al., found that progesterone can help to prevent transmission \nof the virus from an infected mother to the fetus.  But the most interesting \nstudy of the virus in pregnancy involved mice that were engineered to \ncontain extremely large quantities of the HIV provirus (De, et al., \n1997).  At birth, they seemed normal, but within a few days their skin \nbecame diseased, and they quickly wasted away and died.  The experimenters \nrealized that something present in the mother's body had permitted normal \ndevelopment up to the point of birth, and then the wasting disease set \nin.  The placental hormone, chorionic gonadotropin, is produced in large \namounts during pregnancy.  The experimenters gave newborn infected mice \nregular doses of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and they developed \nnormally.Rodents don't respond to gonadotropins or other ovarian stimulation \nexactly the way pigs and primates and people do.  For example, prolactin \nand melatonin usually inhibit progesterone synthesis in people, but \nin rodents, they increase it.  So it's necessary to see exactly what \nhappens to the ovarian hormones when a mouse is given hCG.  In 1996, \nanother group (H. Krzanowska and M. Szoltys) had done that, and found \nthat hCG greatlyincreases progesterone synthesis, but decreases \nestrogen.Considering the progesterone-HIV experiments together, I am reminded \nof a science fiction movie, in which a disease from another planet killed \neveryone in the lab that was studying it, except for one woman, who \nturned out to be pregnant.The medical version of AIDS research, though, pushes aside all of the \nreal science, in favor of a simplistic idea that the virus kills the \ncells of the immune system, and uses false diagnostic methods and deadly \ndrugs to treat something which too often doesn't exist, while denying \nthat there are other real causes of immune deficiency and wasting-sickness, \netc.Aging is characterized by loss of lean body mass, immunodeficiency, \nand a variety of autoimmune reactions.  My perennial argument has been \nthat decreased thyroid and progesterone, associated with increased estrogen \nand stress hormones, are largely responsible for those changes.  The \nhuge investment in AIDS research has found that these occur in AIDS, \nbut, because of the medical pharmaceutical culture which has created \nmyths about these hormones, no one is yet interpreting the hormone imbalances \nin ways that would reveal their responsibility for the symptoms.  While \nthe institutionalized theory claims that the HIV virus is responsible \nfor the syndrome, the hormones are reduced to epiphenomena.REFERENCES © Ray Peat 2006.

Q: Could you tell us about some \nof these studies? In \nthe 1960s the World Health Organization found that when iron supplements \nwere given to anemic people in Africa, there was a great increase in \nthe death rate from infectious diseases, especially malaria. Around \nthe same time, research began to show that the regulation of iron is \na central function of the immune system, and that this seems to have \nevolved because iron is a basic requirement for the survival and growth \nof cells of all types, including bacteria, parasites, and cancer. The \npioneer researcher in the role of iron in immunity believed that an \nexcess of dietary iron contributed to the development of leukemia and \nlymphatic cancers.  Just like lead, mercury, cadmium, nickel and other \nheavy metals, stored iron produces destructive free radicals. The harmful \neffects of iron-produced free radicals are practically indistinguishable \nfrom those caused by exposure to X-rays and gamma rays; both accelerate \nthe accumulation of age-pigment and other signs of aging. Excess iron \nis a crucial element in the transformation of stress into tissue damage \nby free radicals. For \nabout 50 years, it has been known that blood transfusions damage immunity, \nand excess iron has been suspected to be one of the causes for this. \nPeople who regularly donate blood, on the other hand, have often been \nfound to be healthier than non-donors, and healthier than they were \nbefore they began donating. In \none of Hans Selye's pioneering studies, he found that he could experimentally \nproduce a form of scleroderma (hardening of the skin) in animals by \nadministering large doses of iron, followed by a minor stress. He could \nprevent the development of the condition by giving the animals large \ndoses of vitamin E, suggesting that the condition was produced by iron's \noxidative actions. Excess \niron's role in infectious diseases is now well established, and many \nrecent studies show that it is involved in degenerative brain diseases, \nsuch as Parkinson's, ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), Huntington's chorea, \nand Alzheimer's disease. Iron is now believed to have a role in skin \naging, atherosclerosis, and cataracts of the lenses of the eyes, largely \nthrough its formation of the \"age pigment.\" Q: How does excess iron accelerate \nour aging process? During \naging, our tissues tend to store an excess of iron. There is a remarkably \nclose association between the amount of iron stored in our tissues and \nthe risk of death from cancer, heart disease, or from all causes. This \nrelationship between iron and death rate exists even during childhood, \nbut the curve is downward until the age of 12, and then it rises steadily \nuntil death. The shape of this curve, representing the iron burden, \nis amazingly similar to the curves representing the rate of death in \ngeneral, and the rate of death from cancer. There is no other relationship \nin biology that I know of that has this peculiar shape, with its minimum \nat the age of 12, and its maximum in old age at the time of death. One \nof the major lines of aging research, going back to the early part of \nthis century, was based on the accumulation of a brown material in the \ntissues known as \"age-pigment.\" The technical name for this \nmaterial, \"lipofuscin,\" means \"fatty brown stuff.\" \n\nIn the 1960s, the \"free radical theory\" of aging was introduced \nby Denham Harman, and this theory has converged with the age-pigment \ntheory, since we now know that the age-pigment is an oxidized mass of \nunsaturated fat and iron, formed by uncontrolled free radicals. Until \na few years ago, these ideas were accepted by only a few researchers, \nbut now practically every doctor in the country accepts that free radicals \nare important in the aging process.  A nutrition researcher in San Diego \nsuspected that the life-extending effects of calorie restriction might \nbe the result of a decreased intake of toxins. He removed the toxic \nheavy metals from foods, and found that the animals which ate a normal \namount of food lived as long as the semi-starved animals. Recently, \nthe iron content of food has been identified as the major life-shortening \nfactor, rather than the calories. [Choi and Yu, Age vol. 17, page 93, \n1994.] Q: Exactly how much iron do we \nneed to eat? Children's \nnutritional requirements are high, because they are growing, but there \nare indications that in the U.S. even children eat too much iron. Some researchers are concerned \nthat the iron added to cereals is contributing to the incidence of leukemia \nand cancers of the lymphatic tissues in children. [Goodfield, 1984.] \nDuring the time of rapid growth, children are less likely than adults \nto store too much iron. At birth, they have a large amount of stored \niron, and this decreases as they \"grow into it.\" It is after \npuberty, when growth slows and the sex hormones are high, that the storage \nof iron increases. [Blood, Sept., 1976.]  In a study of the \"malnourished\" \n\nchildren of migrant fruit pickers in California, these children who \nwere \"seriously anemic\" were actually more resistant to infectious \ndiseases than were the \"well nourished\" middle class children \nin the same region. If \nthe normal amount of dietary iron causes an increased susceptibility \nto infections even in children, and if a subnormal amount of iron slows \nthe aging process, I think we are going to have to reconsider our ideas \nof nutritional adequacy, to look at the long range effects of diet, \nas well as the immediate effects. My current studies have to do with \nanalyzing our ability to handle stress safely, in relation to our diet. \nI believe our nutritional recommendations for iron have to be revised \nsharply downward. Q. Don't women need extra iron? That's \na misunderstanding. Doctors \ngenerally don't realize that only a few milligrams of iron are lost \neach day in menstruation. The real issue is that you can hardly avoid \ngetting iron, even when you try. Women \nabsorb iron much more efficiently than men do. From a similar meal, \nwomen will normally absorb three times as much iron as men do. When \npregnant, their higher estrogen levels cause them to absorb about nine \ntimes as much as men. Every time a woman menstruates, she loses a little \niron, so that by the age of 50 she is likely to have less iron stored \nin her tissues than a man does at the same age, but by the age of 65 \nwomen generally have as much excess iron in their tissues as men do. \n(During those 15 years, women seem to store iron at a faster rate than \nmen do, probably because they have more estrogen.) At this age their \nrisk of dying from a heart attack is the same as that of men.  Some women \nwho menstruate can donate blood regularly without showing any tendency \nto become anemic. Since \nthe custom of giving large iron supplements to pregnant women has been \nestablished, there has been an increase in jaundice of the newborn. \nIt has been observed that women who didn't take iron supplements during \npregnancy have healthy babies that don't develop jaundice. I have suggested \nthat this could be because they haven't been poisoned by iron. Those \nsupplements could also be a factor in the increased incidence of childhood \ncancer. Q: Don't you need iron supplements \nif you are anemic? In \ngeneral, no. Many \ndoctors think of anemia as necessarily indicating an iron deficiency, \nbut that isn't correct. 100 years ago, it was customary to prescribe \narsenic for anemia, and it worked to stimulate the formation of more \nred blood cells. The fact that arsenic, or iron, or other toxic material \nstimulates the formation of red blood cells doesn't indicate a \"deficiency\" \nof the toxin, but simply indicates that the body responds to a variety \nof harmful factors by speeding its production of blood cells.   Even radiation \ncan have this kind of stimulating effect, because growth is a natural \nreaction to injury. Between 1920 and 1950, it was common to think of \n\"nutritional growth factors\" as being the same as vitamins, \nbut since then it has become common to use known toxins to stimulate \nthe growth of farm animals, and as a result, it has been more difficult \nto define the essential nutrients. The optimal nutritional intake is \nnow more often considered in terms of resistance to disease, longevity \nor rate of aging, and even mental ability. An \nexcess of iron, by destroying vitamin E and oxidizing the unsaturated \nfats in red blood cells, can contribute to hemolytic anemia, in which \nred cells are so fragile that they break down too fast. In aging, red \ncells break down faster, and are usually produced more slowly, increasing \nthe tendency to become anemic, but additional iron tends to be more \ndangerous for older people. Anemia \nin women is caused most often by a thyroid deficiency (as discussed \nin the chapter on thyroid), or by various nutritional deficiencies. \nEstrogen (even in animals that don't menstruate) causes dilution of \nthe blood, so that it is normal for females to have lower hemoglobin \nthan males. Q. What should I do if my doctor tells me I'm anemic? Is \nthere any situation in which a person needs to take iron supplements? Iron \ndeficiency anemia does exist, in laboratory situations and in some cases \nof chronic bleeding, but I believe it should be the last-suspected cause \nof anemia, instead of the first. It should be considered as a possible \ncause of anemia only when very specific blood tests show an abnormally \nlow degree of iron saturation of certain proteins. Usually, physicians \nconsider the amount of hemoglobin or of red cells in the blood as the \nprimary indicator of a need for iron, but that just isn't biologically \nreasonable. If \na large amount of blood is lost in surgery, a temporary anemia might \nbe produced, but even then it would be best to know whether the iron \nstores are really depleted before deciding whether an iron supplement \nwould be reasonable. Liver (or even a water extract of wheat germ) can \nsupply as much iron as would be given as a pill, and is safer. Q. What foods contain iron? Flour, \npasta, etc., almost always contain iron which has been artificially \nadded as ferrous sulfate, because of a federal law. Meats, grains, eggs, \nand vegetables naturally contain large amounts of iron. A few years \nago, someone demonstrated that they could pick up a certain breakfast \ncereal with a magnet, because of the added iron. Black olives contain \niron, which is used as a coloring material. You should look for \"ferrous\" \nor \"ferric\" or \"iron\" on the label, and avoid foods \nwith any added iron. Many labels list \"reduced iron,\" meaning \nthat iron is added in the ferrous form, which is very reactive and easily \nabsorbed. Q.: Why does federal law require \nthe addition of iron to those foods? Industrially \nprocessed grains have most of the nutrients, such as vitamin E, the \nB vitamins, manganese, magnesium, etc., removed to improve the products' \nshelf life and efficiency of processing, and the government required \nthat certain nutrients be added to them as a measure to protect the \npublic's health, but the supplementation did not reflect the best science \neven when it was first made law, since food industry lobbyists managed \nto impose compromises that led to the use of the cheapest chemicals, \nrather than those that offered the greatest health benefits. For example, \nstudies of processed animal food had demonstrated that the addition \nof iron (as the highly reactive form, ferrous sulfate, which happens \nto be cheap and easy to handle) created disease in animals, by destroying \nvitamins in the food. You should read the label of ingredients and avoid \nproducts that contain added iron, when possible. Q: Can cooking in an iron frying \npan put iron into food? Yes, \nespecially if the food is acidic, as many sauces are. The added iron \nwill destroy vitamins in the food, besides being potentially toxic in \nitself. Q: What about aluminum? Aluminum \nand iron react similarly in cells and are suspected causes of Alzheimer's \ndisease. The \naluminum industry started propagandizing more than 50 years ago about \nthe \"safety\" of aluminum utensils, claiming that practically \nnone of the toxic metal gets into the food. Recent research showed that \ncoffee percolated in an aluminum pot contained a large amount of dissolved \naluminum, because of coffee's acidity. Q: What kind of cooking pots or \nutensils are safe? Glass \nutensils are safe, and certain kinds of stainless steel are safe, because \ntheir iron is relatively insoluble. Teflon-coated pans are safe unless \nthey are chipped. Q: How do I know which stainless \nsteels are safe? There \nare two main types of stainless steel, magnetic and nonmagnetic. The \nnonmagnetic form has a very high nickel content, and nickel is allergenic \nand carcinogenic. It is much more toxic than iron or aluminum. You can \nuse a little \"refrigerator magnet\" to test your pans. The \nmagnet will stick firmly to the safer type of pan. Q: Why is there iron in most multi-vitamin \nand mineral products? Although \nseveral researchers have demonstrated that iron destroys vitamins, there \nis enough wishful thinking in industry, government, and the consuming \npublic, that such mistakes can go on for generations before anyone can \nmobilize the resources to bring the truth to the public. 10 years ago, \nI thought it was a hopeful sign of increased awareness of iron's danger \nwhen the manufacturer of a new iron product mentioned in the Physician's \nDesk Reference that it hadn't yet been reported to cause cancer. Q. I can't avoid all those foods, \nespecially the bread and grains. What can I do to keep the iron I ingest \nfrom harming me? Iron \ndestroys vitamin E, so vitamin E should be taken as a supplement. It \nshouldn't be taken at the same time as the iron-contaminated food, because \niron reacts with it in the stomach. About 100 mg. per day is adequate, \nthough our requirement increases with age, as our tissue iron stores \nincrease. Coffee, when taken with food, strongly inhibits the absorption \nof iron, so I always try to drink coffee with meat. Decreasing your \nconsumption of unsaturated fats makes the iron less harmful.  Vitamin \nC stimulates the absorption of iron, so it might be a good idea to avoid \ndrinking orange juice at the same meal with iron-rich foods. A deficiency \nof copper causes our tissues to retain an excess of iron, so foods such \nas shrimp and oysters which contain abundant copper should be used regularly. Q: How does copper help us? Copper \nis the crucial element for producing the color in hair and skin, for \nmaintaining the elasticity of skin and blood vessels, for protecting \nagainst certain types of free radical, and especially for allowing us \nto use oxygen properly for the production of biological energy. It is \nalso necessary for the normal functioning of certain nerve cells (substantia \nnigra) whose degeneration is involved in Parkinson's disease. The shape \nand texture of hair, as well as its color, can change in a copper deficiency. \n Too much iron can block our absorption of copper, and too little copper \nmakes us store too much iron. With aging, our tissues lose copper as \nthey store excess iron. Because of those changes, we need more vitamin \nE as we age. SUMMARY: Iron is a potentially toxic heavy \nmetal; an excess can cause cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses. Other heavy metals, including \nlead and aluminum, are toxic; pans and dishes should be chosen carefully. Iron \ncauses cell aging. Drinking \ncoffee with iron rich foods can reduce iron's toxic effects. Use \nshrimp and oysters, etc., to prevent the copper deficiency which leads \nto excess storage of iron. Avoid \nfood supplements which contain iron. Take \nabout 100 units of vitamin E daily; your vitamin E requirement increases \nwith your iron consumption. GLOSSARY: Free \nradicals are fragments of molecules that are very destructive to all \ncells and system of the body. Respiration \nrefers to the absorption of oxygen by cells, which releases energy. \nThe structure inside the cell in which energy is produced by respiration \nis called the mitochondrion.  Oxidation refers to the combination of \na substance with oxygen. This can be beneficial, as in normal respiration \nthat produces energy, or harmful, as in rancidity, irradiation, or stress \nreactions.  Antioxidants: Vitamin E and vitamin C are known as antioxidants, \nbecause they stop the harmful free-radical chain reactions which often \ninvolve oxygen, but they do not inhibit normal oxidation processes in \ncells. \"Chain breaker\" would be a more suitable term. It is \noften the deficiency of oxygen which unleashes the dangerous free-radical \nprocesses. Many substances can function as antioxidants/chain breakers: \nthyroxine, uric acid, biliverdin, selenium, iodine, vitamin A, sodium, \nmagnesium, and lithium, and a variety of enzymes. Saturated fats work \nwith antioxidants to block the spread of free-radical chain reactions. \n Age pigment is the brown material that forms spots on aging skin, and \nthat accumulates in the lens of the eye forming cataracts, and in blood \nvessels causing hardening of the arteries, and in the heart and brain \nand other organs, causing their functions to deteriorate with age. It \nis made up of oxidized unsaturated oils with iron. Anemic \nmeans lacking blood, in the sense of not having enough red blood cells \nor hemoglobin. It is possible to have too much iron in the blood while \nbeing anemic. Anemia in itself doesn't imply that there is nutritional \nneed for iron. REFERENCES Allen, D.

        "chunk_html": "Leakiness, aging, and cancerA thin layer of fibrin lining blood vessels provides a filtering barrier that helps to strengthen the wall and prevent other proteins from leaking out of the vessels, and it participates in repair processes when the blood vessel is broken.Cellular energy metabolism is the basis for maintaining the barrier functions. Energy depletion causes the endothelial cells lining blood vessels to become excessively permeable.When the organism's resistance is low, proteins and fats that normally remain inside the bloodstream can escape into the extracellular matrix and enter cells, contributing to their stress and disorganization, and other materials can escape from cells and enter the bloodstream.One of the simplest demonstrations of fibrin leakage is to shine a beam of light into the eye; the presence of fibrin and other inappropriate molecules diffuses the light, causing a \"flare\" in the aqueous compartment. Albumin, a small protein from the blood, is often seen in the urine during stress. The effects of that sort of leakage vary with each organ.Fibrin is an essential structural and functional part of the organism, but when it escapes from the bloodstream it participates in the degenerative processes of inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor formation. (Its fragments stimulate secretion of inflammatory mediators: Hamaguchi et al., 1991.)In the hormonal environment dominated by estrogen, mild stresses such as exertion, or even restless sleep, allow toxins (and sometimes bacteria) from the intestine to enter the bloodstream, triggering a complex chain of events that create a systemic inflammatory state. Although these processes have been observed in many simple experiments, their implications are almost always neglected or denied or explained away.\nIncorporation of certain polyunsaturated fats into the tissues increases the leakiness of blood vessels, and amplifies the reactions to stresses and inflammatory stimuli.Antioxidants, thyroid hormone, progesterone, and antiinflammatory agents, including glycine or gelatin, niacin, and saturated fats, can prevent, and in many cases reverse, these degenerative inflammatory processes.Even a single celled organism has to keep its parts separate, and highly differentiated multicelled organisms have many special systems that serve to keep their parts separate, so the different tissues and organs can maintain their distinct functions.The movement of substances from blood to cell, and from cell to cell, is normally very tightly controlled, and when the systems that control those movements of water and its solutes are damaged, the tissues' structures and functions are altered. The prevention of inappropriate leakiness can protect against the degenerative processes, and against aging itself, which is, among other things, a state of generalized leakiness.When cells' energy is depleted, water and various dissolved molecules are allowed to move into the cells, out of the cells, and through or around cells inappropriately. The weakened cells can even permit whole bacteria and similar particles to pass into and out of the blood stream more easily.One of the earliest investigators of the effects of stress and fatigue on nerves and other cells was A.P. Nasonov, in the first half of the 20th century. A.S. Troshin (1956) has reviewed his work in detail. He showed that in cells as different as algae and nerve cells, fatigue caused them to take up dyes, and that the dyes were extruded, if the cells were able to recover their energy. When nerve cells are excited for a fraction of a second, they take up sodium and calcium, but quickly eliminate them. Prolonged excitation, leading to fatigue, can gradually shift the balance, allowing more substances to enter, and to stay longer.When nerves or other cells are quickly killed with heavy metals such as osmium, the metals are visible in a layer at the surface, which is sometimes taken as evidence of a \"cytoplasmic membrane,\" but if the cells have suffered oxygen deprivation or have been injured by X-rays, the metal will be visible as a grey color evenly distributed through the cell. The deposition of the metal occurs when it reacts with electrons. In the relatively vital cell, the heavy metal stops at the surface, and is mostly reduced there, but the devitalized cell presents no structural or chemical barrier to the entry of the metal, and the reactive electrons appear to be evenly distributed through the cell.  Oxygen deprivation, X-irradiation, and other stresses cause the cell to be unable to use electrons to produce energy, and instead the electrons are available to react destructively with whatever may be available. While Nasonov showed that dyes and even particles enter energetically depleted cells, newer techniques are able to show that the leaky cells are structurally disrupted by the excessive reduction of their proteins, by excited electrons and free radicals.In the 1970s, experimenters found that muscles from vitamin E deficient animals released their enzymes when washed in a saline solution, more easily than did the muscles from vitamin E replete animals. Other experiments around the same time showed that reducing the ATP of muscles caused a similar loss of their ability to retain their proteins.Over the years, many experiments have established, both in vitro and in vivo, that fatigue, stress, aging, and inflammation cause cells to lose their normal constituents, but also to allow foreign materials to enter more easily.When I was working on my thesis, around 1970, investigating the effects of aging on the metabolism of the uterus, I found that the changes occuring during aging were (in all the ways I tested) the same as those produced by X-irradiation, excess estrogen, oxygen deprivation, excess polyunsaturated fats, and vitamin E deficiency.Although everyone working in the lab was familiar with the appearance of the uterus from old hamsters (they are typically large, stiff, and bluish), everyone was surprised when I suggested that the aged uteri seemed to function as if they were under the influence of a considerable amount of estrogen. Everyone was familiar with the medical textbook doctrine that \"menopause is caused by estrogen deficiency.\" In humans, gynecologists know about \"Chadwick's sign,\" the fact that the uterine cervix turns blue or purple during pregnancy, and everyone knows that blood is blue when it's deprived of oxygen, so it's surprising that estrogen's effect on tissue oxygenation isn't widely recognized.When estrogen is given to an animal, it almost instantly causes capillaries to become leaky, allowing water to move out of the blood stream, and at the same time, estrogen causes cells to take up water. Both of these processes are the same as the early effects of oxygen deprivation. In the normal reproductive cycle, the surge of estrogen lasts only a few hours, and normal permeability is quickly restored by increasing progesterone. During those intermittent short exposures to estrogen, there isn't a massive leakage of serum proteins into the tissues. During the time of estrogenic influence, all kinds of cells are influenced, with the excitatory equilibrium of nerve cells, glandular cells, and immune system cells being shifted, lowering the threshold of excitation, or prolonging the excited state.Anything that causes inflammation causes a similar loss of water from the blood, as it is taken up by swelling cells. If inflammation is generalized, it causes circulatory shock, because the volume of the blood has become insufficient to serve the organism's needs. One of Hans Selye's earliest observations of the effect of an overdose of estrogen was that it causes shock.Although water loss causes the blood to become more viscous under the influence of estrogen, the plasma becomes hypotonic, meaning that it contains fewer osmotically active solutes than normal; some of the sodium that helps to maintain the blood's osmotic balance is lost through the kidneys, and some is taken up by the red blood cells and other cells. The osmotic imbalance of the blood causes tissue cells to take up more water, contributing to their increased excitability. In many cases, the vascular leakage of inflammation and shock can be corrected by using osmotically active substances, such as starch solutions, gelatin, or concentrated sodium chloride.The tissue water retention caused by estrogen, hypoxia, and stress is analogous to the swelling of gels and colloids, that is, it's governed by the state of the electrons and counterions in the system. Excitation, fatigue, or injury can cause a shift of pH toward alkalinity, causing water uptake and swelling.The blue color of the pregnant cervix, or of the uterus in an animal given an overdose of estrogen, indicates that the tissue isn't sufficiently oxygenated to maintain its normal red color, even though the flow of blood is increased. Some experimenters have noticed that newborn animals sometimes have the postural reflex (lordosis) that indicates an estrogenic state, and that suffocation can produce the same reflex. Irradiating animals with x-rays will also produce the whole range of estrogenic effects.One of the features of the aged uterus that I studied was the age pigment, lipofuscin, a brown waxy material that accumulates in old or stressed tissues. Prolonged dosage with estrogen accelerates the formation of this pigment, which is largely derived from oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids. Increased amounts of those fats in the diet, or a deficiency of vitamin E, or exposure to ionizing radiation, or oxygen deprivation, can also accelerate the formation of the age pigment. The presence of the pigment intensifies the effect of estrogen, since the pigment wastes oxygen by functioning as an oxidase enzyme.Other tests that I did on aged, or estrogenized, uterine tissue indicated that several oxidative systems were activated; for example, the tissues showed an extremely high activity of the enzyme peroxidase, and a very intense reduction of a chemical dye (tetrazolium/formazan) that indicates the presence of reductive and oxidative activity, of the sorts caused by radiation and oxygen deprivation. These reductive and oxidative processes include the production of some free radicals that are capable of reacting randomly with polyunsaturated fatty acids.The interactions between estrogen and the polyunsaturated fats are now coming to be more widely recognized as important factors in the inflammatory/hyperpermeable conditions that contribute to the development of heart and blood vessel disease, hypertension, cancer, autoimmune diseases, dementia, and other less common degenerative conditions.Estrogen increases lipid peroxidation, and maintains a chronically high circulating level of free fatty acids, mainly PUFA, activates the phospholipases that release arachidonic acid from cells leading to formation of prostaglandins and isoprostanes, and increases the enzymes that form the inflammation-promoting platelet activating factor (PAF) while suppressing the enzymes that destroy it, and increases a broad range of other inflammatory mediators, interleukins, and NF-kappa B.The leakage of enzymes out of cells and into the blood stream is recognized medically as evidence of damage to the organ that is losing them. Different combinations of enzymes are commonly considered to be evidence of a heart attack, or skeletal muscle damage, or liver disease, pancreatitis, prostate cancer, etc. But often the reason for the leakage isn't understood. Hypothyroidism, for example, causes leakage of enzymes, possibly mainly from the liver, but also from other organs. Excess estrogen, intense exercise, starvation, anything that increases lipid peroxidation and free radical production, such as drinking alcohol when the tissues contain polyunsaturated fats, can cause organs such as heart and liver to leak their components.The loss of enzymes increases the energy needed to stay alive, but it doesn't necessarily change the basic functions of the cell. (Though when mitochondrial enzymes leak out into the cytoplasm, the cell's energy metabolism is impaired, at least temporarily.) But the entry of catalytic materials from other tissues changes the organization of a cell, giving it conflicting instructions. In many situations, as L.V. Polezhaev and V. Filatov demonstrated, the substances released during stress and degeneration serve to stimulate healing and regeneration. But when the resources aren't available for full repair or regeneration, only a scar, or atrophic fibrosis, or a tumor will be formed.In severe stress, intracellular fibrin deposits have been found in the heart and other organs, including the prostate gland. Deficiency of testosterone causes vascular leakage into the prostate. Fibrin promotes tumor growth, partly by serving as a matrix, partly by releasing stimulatory peptides.Kidney disease, diabetes, pregnancy toxemia and retinal degeneration are probably the best known problems involving vascular leakage, but increasingly, cancer and heart disease are being recognized as consequences of prolonged permeability defects. Congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension commonly cause leakage of fluid into the lungs, and shock of any sort causes the lung to get \"wet,\" a waterlogged condition called \"shock lung.\" Simply hyperventilating for a couple of minutes will increase leakage from the blood into the lungs; hyperventilation decreases carbon dioxide, and increases serotonin and histamine. Hyperoxia itself contributes to lung injury, and exacerbates emphysema, though it is common to see patients breathing a high concentration of oxygen. Emphysema (which can be caused by hypothyroidism or hyper-estrogenism, and often can be cured by thyroid or progesterone) and many other respiratory problems are associated with capillary leakage. Cells of the lung and intestine are able to synthesize their own fibrin, apparently because of their special problems in preventing leakage. Prolonged systemic inflammation can lead to lung fibrosis, and fibrosis increases the likelihood of lung cancer.The inflammatory state that causes exaggerated cellular permeability is very closely related to \"hyperventilation,\" the loss of too much carbon dioxide. The release of serotonin during hyperventilation isn't the only cause of vascular leakage; the carbon dioxide itself is an essential factor in regulating the state of cellular electrons and in maintaining cellular integrity. Hyperventilation, like the shift from oxidative to glycolytic energy production that typifies estrogenized or stressed cells or cancer, raises intracellular pH. In the case of mast cells, increasing alkalinity causes them to release histamine (Alfonso, et al., 2005), but similar \"alkaline-induced exocytosis\" seems to occur in all stressed tissues.The blood platelets that become incontinent and leak serotonin in the absence of carbon dioxide are undergoing the same structural stresses experience by endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, mast cells and all other cells when carbon dioxide is depleted. Although it has been about 70 years since Yandell Henderson made it clear that supplemental oxygen should be combined with carbon dioxide, mechanical ventilation in hospitals is still causing lung injury resulting from hyperventilation, i.e., the absence of carbon dioxide.\nA similar misunderstanding of biology was involved in the use of dialysis to treat kidney disease. Until recently, commercial dialysis fluids contained acetate and/or racemic lactate instead of bicarbonate, because of the difficulty of preparing bicarbonate solutions, and the result was that very prolonged dialysis would damage the brain and other organs. (Veech and Gitomer, 1988, Veech and Fowler, 1987.) Dialysis has been seen to increase lung permeability Bell, et al., 1988).Amyloidosis produced by chronic dialysis affects all organs, but its effects are best known in the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs. Serum amyloid-A is one of the acute phase proteins, like C-reactive protein (CRP), that are produced by inflammation. Estrogen, radiation and other stresses increase those pro-inflammatory acute phase proteins, and decrease protective albumin, which is called a \"negative acute phase protein,\" since it decreases when the other acute phase proteins increase. The liver is the major source of the acute phase proteins, and it is constantly burdened by toxins absorbed from the bowel; disinfection of the bowel is known to accelerate recovery from stress.Seen from the perspective of the stress-leakage syndrome, any serious injury or sickness damages all organs.\nThe exhaled breath is being used to diagnose inflammatory lung disease, since so many of the mediators of inflammation are volatile, but systemic diseases such as cancer and arthritis, and relatively minor stress can be detected by changes in the chemicals found in the breath. Polyunsaturated fats and their breakdown products--aldehydes, prostaglandins, isoprostanes, hydrocarbons, and free radicals--and carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrite, and hydrogen peroxide are increased in the breath by most stresses.\nBoth proline and glycine (which are major amino acids in gelatin) are very protective for the liver, increasing albumin, and stopping oxidative damage.Saturated fats are protective against free radical damage and can reverse liver fibrosis.\nThyroid hormone protects against excess estrogen, and can prevent or reverse fibrosis of the heart.\nAntiestrogens are widely effective against vascular leakage. Thyroid, progesterone, and testosterone are among the most effective natural antiestrogens, and they are curative in many conditions that involve vascular leakage. Progesterone and pregnenolone have been called the antifibromatic steroids, and it has been used to treat many inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, including cancer.The antiserotonin drugs are being increasingly used to treat fibrotic diseases, and other problems related to vascular leakage.Antiinflammatory and anticoagulant things, especially aspirin and vitamin E, protect against the accelerated turnover of fibrinogen/fibrin caused by estrogen and the various inflammatory states.© Ray Peat 2006.

        "chunk_html": "Menopause and its causesWhen \nI was in graduate school at the University of Oregon, everyone in our \nlab was working on the problem of reproductive aging.  Previously, \npeople in the lab had established that the ovaries didn't \"run \nout of eggs.\"  There was never really any basis for that ridiculous \nbelief.  Many people just said it, the way they said \"old \neggs\" (but never old sperms) were responsible for birth defects, \nor that \"estrogen is the female hormone,\" a deficiency of \nwhich is the cause of menopausal infertility.  (Old sperms have \nbeen implicated in some birth defects.People who are newly married, for example, were found to have children \nwith fewer birth defects than people of the same age who had been married \na long time, suggesting that more frequent intercourse involves fresher \nsperms.)  When ovaries have been treated with x-rays to destroy \ntheir ability to ovulate, they have been found to produce more estrogen \nthan before. Ovulation is one thing, and the production of hormones \nis another thing.  You can't determine whether ovulation has occurred \nby measuring the hormones. Knowing \nthe large amount of work that has gone into our understanding of the \nage-related decline in fertility, it is disturbing to see people on \ntelevision and in popular health books saying that menopause occurs \nwhen the \"ovaries run out of eggs.\" Around \n1970, many people were saying that aging was caused by the loss of brain \ncells.  There is a glimmer of truth in that silly idea, just as \nthere would be in saying that \"aging is caused by the death of \nskin cells,\" making the skin thinner and drier and less elastic.  \nBoth the brain and the skin are sources of steroid hormones, and it \nis possible that the death of skin cells and neurons is one factor in \nthe age-related decline in the \"sex steroids.\"  An organism \nwould be an easier thing to understand if cells just did their job for \na certain period of time, and then died.  A man named Hayflick \nhas given people some publications to cite, when they want to simplify \nthings by saying that aging occurs when cells have used up their quota \nof 50 divisions, but there are many more studies that clearly show that \nHayflick's limit is nothing but a product of the cells' environment.  \nThe cell's environment, the signals and substances and energy it receives, \nis complex, but real progress is being made in understanding the things \ninvolved in the aging process.  Luckily, the infinite complexity \nof the environment is channeled into an understandable array of processes \nby the cell's systematic ways of responding. I \nknew, from talking with L. C. Strong,1 that early reproductive maturity \nwas associated with early death; in his strains of cancer-prone mice, \nhe showed that high estrogen was the cause of early puberty, a high \ncancer incidence, and a relatively short life.  D. A. Snowdon, \net al., showed that the occurrence of menopause at an early age in women \nis associated with a greater risk of death from all causes, including \nstrokes and coronary heart disease.2  (They saw ovarian aging as \nan indicator of general aging.)  P. W. F. Wilson, et al., reported \nthat postmenopausal estrogen use was associated with an increased incidence \nof heart disease and stroke.3  P. M. Wise showed that estrogen \naccelerates aging of the central nervous system, destroying the nerves \nwhich regulate the pituitary gonadotropins, and causing ovarian failure \nand infertility.4  Many other studies of particular tissues show \nthat estrogen accelerates the rate of aging. In \nmy work with hamsters, I found that the infertility that developed at \nmiddle age was caused by a high rate of oxygen consumption in the uterus, \ncausing the oxygen needed by the developing embryo to be consumed by \nuterine tissues, and causing suffocation of the embryo.  This is \nthe central mechanism by which the estrogen-containing contraceptives \nwork:at any stage of pregnancy, a sufficient dose of estrogen \nkills the embryo. Polvani \nand Nencioni,5 among others, found that in women, the onset of menopause \n(the first missed period, suddenly increased bone loss, nervous symptoms \nsuch as depression, insomnia, and flushing) corresponds to the failure \nto produce progesterone, while estrogen is produced at normal levels.  \nThis results in a great functional excess of estrogen, because it is \nno longer opposed by progesterone.  Typically, it takes about four \nyears for the monthly estrogen excess to disappear.  They suggested \nthat the bone loss sets in immediately when progesterone fails because \ncortisol then is able to dominate, causing bone catabolism; progesterone \nnormally protects against cortisol.  Other researchers have pointed \nout that estrogen dominance promotes mitosis of the prolactin-secreting \ncells of the pituitary, and that prolactin causes osteoporosis; by age \n50, most people have some degree of tumefaction of the prolactin-secreting \npart of the pituitary.  But estrogen dominance (or progesterone \ndeficiency) also clearly obstructs thyroid secretion, and thyroid governs \nthe rate of bone metabolism and repair.  Correcting the thyroid \nand progesterone should take care of the cortisol/prolactin/osteo- porosis \nproblem. P. \nM. Wise4 has demonstrated that the \"menopausal\" pituitary \nhormones, high levels of LH and FSH, are produced because the regulatory \nnerves in the hypothalamus have lost their sensitivity to estrogen, \nnot because estrogen is deficient.  In fact, he showed that the \nnerves are desensitized precisely by their cumulative exposure to estrogen.  \nIf an animal's ovaries are removed when it is young, the regulatory \nnerves do not atrophy, and if ovaries are transplanted into these animals \nat the normally infertile age, they are fertile.  But if animals \nare given larger doses of estrogen during youth, those nerves atrophy \nprematurely, and they become prematurely infertile. The \nmechanism by which estrogen desensitizes and kills brain cells is now \nrecognized as the \"excitotoxic\" process, in which the excitatory \ntransmitter glutamic acid is allowed to exhaust the nerve cells.  \n(This explains the older observations that glutamic acid, or aspartic \nacid, or aspartame, can cause brain damage and reproductive failure.)  \nCortisol also activates the excitotoxic system, in other brain cells, \ncausing stress-induced atrophy of those cells.6  Progesterone and \npregnenolone are recognized as inhibitors of this excitotoxic process. Besides \nestrogen's promotion of excitotoxic cell death, leading to the failure \nof the gonadotropin regulatory system, estrogen's stress-mimicking action \nprobably tends to increase the secretion of LH, in ways that can be \ncorrected by supplementing progesterone and thyroid.  Since Selye's \nwork, it has been known that estrogen creates the same conditions as \noccur in the shock phase of the stress reaction.  (And shock, in \na potential vicious circle, can increase the level of estrogen.7)  \nIt has recently been demonstrated that estrogen stimulates the adrenal \nglands, independently of the pituitary's ACTH.  This can increase \nthe production of adrenal androgens, leading to hirsutism, and other \nmale traits, including anabolic effects.8 It \nwas established in the 1950s that estrogen \"erases\" memories \nin well trained animals.  I suppose that acute effect is related \nto the chronic toxicity that leads to cell death.  (In the 1940s, \nDES was sold to prevent miscarriages, though it was already known that \nit caused them;then there was the argument that it slowed aging \nof the skin, despite the Revlon studies at the University of Pennsylvania \nshowing that it accelerates all aspects of skin aging;lately \nthere has been talk of promoting estrogen to improve memory.) Estrogen's \nnerve-exciting action is known to lower seizure thresholds;premenstrual \nepilepsy is probably another acute sign of the neurotoxicity of estrogen. When \nfatigue and lethargy are associated with aging, the brain stimulating \naction of estrogen can make a woman feel that she has more energy.(Large doses given to rats will make them run compulsively;running \nwheels with odometers have shown that they will run over 30 miles a \nday from the influence of estrogen.)  Estrogen inhibits one of \nthe enzymic routes for inactivating brain amines, and so it has more \ngeneral effects on the brain than just the glutamate system.  This \ngeneralized effect on brain amines is more like the effects of cocaine \nor amphetamine.  If that is a woman's basis for wanting to use \nestrogen, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor would be safer. The \nreason for the menopausal progesterone deficiency is a complex of stress-related \ncauses.  Free-radicals (for example, from iron in the corpus luteum) \ninterfere with progesterone synthesis, as do prolactin, ACTH, estrogen, \ncortisol, carotene, and an imbalance of gonadotropins.  A deficiency \nof thyroid, vitamin A, and LDL-cholesterol can also prevent the synthesis \nof progesterone.  Several of the things which cause early puberty \nand high estrogen, also tend to work against progesterone synthesis.  \nThe effect of an intra-uterine irritant is to signal the ovary to suppress \nprogesterone production, to prevent pregnancy while there is a problem \nin the uterus.  The logic by which ACTH suppresses progesterone \nsynthesis is similar, to prevent pregnancy during stress. Since progesterone \nand pregnenolone protect brain cells against the excitotoxins, anything \nthat chronically lowers the body's progesterone level tends to accelerate \nthe estrogen-induced excitotoxic death of brain cells. Since progesterone \nand pregnenolone protect brain cells against the excitotoxins, anything \nthat chronically lowers the body's progesterone level tends to accelerate \nthe estrogen-induced excitotoxic death of brain cells. Chronic constipation, \nand anxiety which decreases blood circulation in the intestine, can \nincrease the liver's exposure to endotoxin.  Endotoxin (like intense \nphysical activity) causes the estrogen concentration of the blood to \nrise.  Diets that speed intestinal peristalsis might be expected \nto postpone menopause.  Penicillin treatment, probably by lowering \nendotoxin production, is known to decrease estrogen and cortisone, while \nincreasing progesterone.  The same effect can be achieved by eating \nraw carrots (especially with coconut oil/olive oil dressing) every day, \nto reduce the amount of bacterial toxins absorbed, and to help in the \nexcretion of estrogen.  Finally, long hours of daylight are known to increase \nprogesterone production, and long hours of darkness are stressful.  \nAnnually, our total hours of day and night are the same regardless of \nlatitude, but different ways of living, levels of artificial illumination, \netc., have a strong influence on our hormones.  In some animal \nexperiments, prolonged exposure to light has delayed some aspects of \naging. General \naging contributes to the specific changes that lead to menopause, but \nthe animal experiments show that fertility can be prolonged to a much \ngreater age by preventing excitotoxic exhaustion of the hypothalamic \nnerves.  The question that still needs to be more clearly answered \nis, to what extent can general aging be prevented or delayed by protecting \nagainst the excitotoxins?  Minimizing estrogen (and cortisone) \nwith optimal thyroid activity,  and maximizing pregnenolone and \nprogesterone to prevent excitotoxic cell fatigue, can be done easily.  \nA diet low in iron and unsaturated fats protects the respiratory apparatus \nfrom the damaging effects of excessive excitation, and--since pregnenolone \nis formed in the mitochondrion--also helps to prevent the loss of these \nhormones.

        "chunk_html": "Osteoporosis, harmful calcification, and nerve/muscle malfunctionsDuring \npregnancy, a woman's ability to retain dietary calcium and iron increases, \nand the baby seems to be susceptible to overloading. A normal baby doesn't \nneed dietary iron for several months, as it uses the iron stored in \nits tissue, and recently it has been reported that normal fetuses and \nbabies may have calcified pituitary glands. Pituitary cell death is \nsometimes seen with the concretions. (Groisman, et al.) Presumably, \nthe calcification is resorbed as the baby grows. This is reminiscent \nof the \"age pigment\" that can be found in newborns, representing \nfetal stress from hypoxia, since that too disappears shortly after birth. \nIron overload, age pigment, and calcification of soft tissues are so \ncommonly associated with old age, that it is important to recognize \nthat the same cluster occurs at the other extreme of (young) age, and \nthat respiratory limitations characterize both of these periods of life. Calcium \nis probably the most popular element in physiological research, since \nit functions as a regulatory trigger in many cell processes, including \ncell stimulation and cell death. Its tendency to be deposited with iron \nin damaged tissue has often been mentioned. In hot weather, chickens \npant to cool themselves, and this can lead to the production of thin \negg shells. Carbonated water provides enough carbon dioxide to replace \nthat lost in panting, and allows normal calcification of the shells. \n[Science 82, May, 1982] The deposition of calcium is the last phase \nof the \"tertiary coat\" of the egg, to which the oviduct glands \nsuccessively add albumin, \"egg membrane,\" and the shell, containing \nmatrix proteins (including some albumin; Hincke, 1995) and calcium crystals. \nAlbumin is the best understood of these layers, but it is still complex \nand mysterious; its unusual affinity for metal ions has invited comparisons \nwith proteins of the immune system. It is known to be able to bind iron \nstrongly, and this is considered to have an \"immunological\" \n\nfunction, preventing the invasion of organisms that depend on iron. \nMaria de Sousa (\"Iron and the lymphomyeloid system: A growing knowledge,\" \nIron in Immunity, Cancer and Inflammation, ed. by M. de Sousa and J. \nH. Brock, Wiley & Sons, 1989) has argued that the oxygen delivery \nsystem and the immune system evolved together, recycling iron in a tightly \ncontrolled system. The \nrole of macrophages in the massive turnover of hemoglobin, and as osteoclasts, \ngives us a perspective in which iron and calcium are handled in analogous \nways. Mechnikov's view of the immune system, growing from his observations \nof the \"phagocytes,\" similarly gave it a central role in the \norganism as a form-giving/ nutrition-related process. In a family with \n\"marble-bone disease,\" or osteopetrosis, it was found that \ntheir red blood cells lacked one form of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, \nand that as a result, their body fluids retained abnormally high concentrations \nof carbon dioxide. Until these people were studied, it had been assumed \nthat an excess of carbon dioxide would have the opposite effect, dissolving \nbones and causing osteoporosis or osteopenia, instead of osteopetrosis. \nThe thyroid hormone is responsible for the carbon dioxide produced in \nrespiration. Chronic hypothyroidism causes osteopenia, and in this connection, \nit is significant that women (as a result of estrogen's effects on the \nthyroid) are much more likely than men to be hypothyroid, and that, \nrelative to men, women in general are \"osteopenic,\" that is, \nthey have more delicate skeletons than men do. In \nan experiment, rats were given a standard diet, to which had been added \n1% Armour thyroid, that is, they were made extremely hyperthyroid. Since \ntheir diet was inadequate (later experiments showed that this amount \nof thyroid didn't cause growth retardation when liver was added to the \ndiet) for their high metabolic rate, they died prematurely, in an apparently \nundernourished state, weighing much less than normal rats. Their bones, \nhowever, were larger and heavier than the bones of normal rats. A few \nincompetent medical \"studies\" have made people fear that \"taking \nthyroid can cause osteoporosis.\" Recognizing that hypothyroid women \nare likely to have small bones and excessive cortisol production, the \ninadequate treatment of hypothyroidism with thyroxin (the thyroid-suppressive \nprecursor material), is likely to be associated with relative osteoporosis, \nsimply because it doesn't correct hypothyroidism. Similar misinterpretations \nhave led people to see an association between \"thyroid use\" \n(generally thyroxin) and breast cancer--hypothyroid women are likely \nto have cancer, osteoporosis, obesity, etc., and are also likely to \nhave been inadequately treated for hypothyroidism. T3, the active form \nof thyroid hormone, does contribute to bone formation. (For example, \nM. Alini, et al.) Around \nthe same time (early 1940s) that the effects of thyroid on bone development \nwere being demonstrated, progesterone was found to prevent age-related \nchanges in bones, and \"excessive\" seeming doses of thyroid \nwere found to prevent age-related joint diseases in rats. A \nlogical course of events, building on these and subsequent discoveries, \nwould have been to observe that the glucocorticoids cause a negative \ncalcium balance, leading to osteoporosis, and that thyroid and progesterone \noppose those hormones, protecting against osteoporosis. But the drug \nindustry had discovered the profits in estrogen (\"the female hormone\") \nand the cortisone-class of drugs. Estrogen was promoted to prevent miscarriages, \nto stop girls (and boys) from growing too tall, to cure prostate and \nbreast cancer, to remedy baldness, and 200 other absurdities. As all \nof those frauds gradually became untenable, even in the commercial medical \nculture, the estrogen industry began to concentrate on osteoporosis \nand femininity. Heart disease and Alzheimer's disease back those up. \"If estrogen causes arthritis, \nprescribe prednisone for the inflammation. If prednisone causes osteoporosis, \nincrease the dose of estrogen to retard the bone-loss. People are tough, \nand physiological therapies aren't very profitable.\" Fifteen \nyears ago I noted in a newsletter that hip fractures most often occur \nin frail, underweight old women, and that heavier, more robust women \nseem to be able to bear more weight with less risk of fracture. Although \nI hadn't read it at the time, a 1980 article (Weiss, et al.) compared \npatients with a broken hip or arm with a control group made up of hospitalized \northopedic patients with problems other than hip or arm fractures. The \nfracture cases' weight averaged 19 pounds lighter than that of the other \npatients. They were more than 3.6 times as likely to be alcoholic or \nepileptic. It would be fair to describe them as a less robust group. Since \nthe use of estrogen has become so common in the U.S., it is reasonable \nto ask whether the incidence of hip fractures in women over 70 has declined \nin recent decades. If estrogen protects against hip fractures, then \nwe should see a large decrease in their incidence in the relevant population. Hip \nfractures, like cancer, strokes, and heart disease, are strongly associated \nwith old age. Because of the baby-boom, 1945 to 1960, our population \nhas a bulge, a disproportion in people between the ages of 35 and 50, \nand those older. Increasingly, we will be exposed to publicity about \nthe declining incidence of disease, fraudulently derived from the actually \ndeclining proportion of old people. For example, analyzing claims based \non the pretense that the population bulge doesn't exist, I have seen \ngreat publicity given to studies that would imply that our life-expectancy \nis now 100 years, or more. Comparing \nthe number of hip fractures, per 1000 75 year old women, in 1996, with \nthe rate in 1950, we would have a basis for judging whether estrogen \nis having the effect claimed for it. The \nx-ray data seem to convince many people estrogen is improving bone health, \nby comparing measurements in the same person before and after treatment. \nDoes estrogen cause water retention? Yes. Does tissue water content \nincrease measured bone density? Yes. Are patients informed that their \n\"bone scans\" don't have a scientific basis? No. The calcification \nof soft tissues under the influence of estrogen must also be taken into \naccount in interpreting x-ray evidence. (Hoshino, 1996) Granted that \nwoman who are overweight have fewer hip fractures (and more cancer and \ndiabetes), what factors are involved? Insulin is the main factor promoting \nfat storage, and it is anabolic for bone. (Rude and Singer, \"Hormonal \nmodifiers of mineral metabolism.\") The greatest decrease in bone \nmass resulting from insulin deficiency was seen in white females, and \nafter five years of insulin treatment, there was a lower incidence of \ndecreased bone mass (Rosenbloom, et al., 1977). McNair, et al. (1978 \nand 1979) found that the loss of bone mass coincided with the onset \nof clinical diabetes. Since excess cortisol can cause both high blood \nsugar and bone loss, when diabetes is defined on the basis of high blood \nsugar, it will often involve high blood sugar caused by excess cortisol, \nand there will be calcium loss. Elsewhere, I have pointed out some of \nthe similarities between menopause and Cushing's syndrome; a deficiency \nof thyroid and progesterone can account for many of these changes. Nencioni \nand Polvani have observed the onset of progesterone deficiency coinciding \nwith bone loss, and have emphasized the importance of progesterone's \nantagonism to cortisol. Johnston \n(1979) found that progesterone (but not estrone, estradiol, testosterone, \nor androstenedione) was significantly lower in those losing bone mass \nmost rapidly. Around \nthe age of 50, when bone loss is increasing, progesterone and thyroid \nare likely to be deficient, and cortisol and prolactin are likely to \nbe increased. Prolactin contributes directly to bone loss, and is likely \nto be one of the factors that contributes to decreased progesterone \nproduction. Estrogen \ntends to cause increased secretion of prolactin and the glucocorticoids, \nwhich cause bone loss, but it also promotes insulin secretion, which \ntends to prevent bone loss. All of these factors are associated with \nincreased cancer risk. Thyroid \nand progesterone, unlike estrogen, stimulate bone-building, and are \nassociated with a decreased risk of cancer. It seems sensible to use \nthyroid and progesterone for their general anti-degenerative effects, \nprotecting the bones, joints, brain, immune system, heart, blood vessels, \nbreasts, etc. But \nthe issue of calcification/decalcification is so general, we mustn't \nlose interest just because the practical problem of osteoporosis is \napproaching solution. For \nexample, healthy high energy metabolism requires the exclusion of most \ncalcium from cells, and when calcium enters the stimulated or deenergized \ncell, it is likely to trigger a series of reactions that lower energy \nproduction, interfering with oxidative metabolism. During aging, both \ncalcium and iron tend to accumulate and they both seem to have an affinity \nfor similar locations, and they both tend to displace copper. (Compare \nK. Sato, et al., on the calcification of copper-containing paints.) \nElastin is a protein, the units of which are probably bound together \nby copper atoms. In old age, elastin is one of the first substances \nto calcify, for example in the elastic layers of arteries, causing them \nto lose elasticity, and to harden into almost bone-like tubes. In the \nheart and kidneys, the mitochondria (rich in copper-enzymes) are often \nthe location showing the earliest calcification, for example when magnesium \nis deficient. Obviously, \ncertain proteins have higher than average affinity for copper, iron, \nand calcium. For example, egg-white's unusual behavior with copper can \nbe seen if you make a meringue in a copper pan--the froth is unusually \nfirm. My guess is that copper atoms bind the protein molecules into \nrelatively elastic systems. In many systems, calcium forms the link \nbetween adhesive proteins. In \nbrain degeneration, the regions that sometimes accumulate aluminum, \nwill accumulate other metals instead, if they predominate in the environment; \ncalcium is found in this part of the brain in some of the Pacific regions \nstudied by Gajdusek. Certain cells in the brain used to be called \"metalophils,\" \nbecause they could be stained intensely with silver and other metals; \nI suppose these are part of the immune system, handling iron as described \nby Maria de Sousa. Macrophages have been proposed as an important factor \nin producing atherosclerotic plaques (Carpenter, et al.). There is evidence \nthat they (and not smooth muscle cells) are the characteristic foam \ncells, and their conversion of polyunsaturated oils into age pigment \naccounts for the depletion of those fats in the plaques. The same evidence \ncould be interpreted as a defensive reaction, binding iron and destroying \nunsaturated fatty acids, and by this detoxifying action, possibly protecting \nagainst calcification and destruction of elastin. (This isn't the first \nsuggestion that atherosclerosis might represent a protective process; \nsee S. M. Plotnikov, et al., 1994.) Since \ncarbon dioxide and bicarbonate are formed in the mitochondria, it is \nreasonable to suppose that the steady outward flow of the bicarbonate \nanion would facilitate the elimination of calcium from the mitochondria. \nSince damaged mitochondria are known to start the process of pathological \ncalcification in the heart and kidneys, it probably occurs in other \ntissues that are respiratorily stressed. And if healthy respiration, \nproducing carbon dioxide, is needed to keep calcium outside the cell, \nan efficient defense system could also facilitate the deposition of \ncalcium in suitable places--depending on specific protein binding. The \nover-grown bones in the hyperthyroid rats and the women with osteopetrosis \nsuggest that an abundance of carbon dioxide facilitates bone formation. \nSince no ordinary inorganic process of precipitation/crystallization \nhas been identified that could account for this, we should consider \nthe possibility that the protein matrix is regulated in a way that promotes \n(or resists) calcification. The affinity of carbon dioxide for the amine \ngroups on proteins (as in the formation of carbamino hemoglobin, which \nchanges the shape of the protein) could change the affinity of collagen \nor other proteins for calcium. Normally, ATP is considered to be the \nmost important substance governing such changes of protein conformation \nor binding properties, but ordinarily, ATP and CO2 are closely associated, \nbecause both are produced in respiration. Gilbert Ling has suggested \nthat hormones such as progesterone also act as cardinal adsorbants, \nregulating the affinity of proteins for salts and other molecules. Cells \nhave many proteins with variable affinity for calcium; for example in \nmuscle, a system called the endoplasmic reticulum, releases and then \nsequesters calcium to control contraction and relaxation. (This calcium-binding \nsystem is backed up by--and is spatially in close association with--that \nof the mitochondrion.) Ion-exchange resins can be chemically modified \nto change their affinity for specific ions, and molecules capable of \nreacting strongly with proteins can change the affinities of the proteins \nfor minerals. What evidence is there that carbon dioxide could influence \ncalcium binding? The earliest deposition of crystals on implanted material \nis calcium carbonate. (J. Vuola, et al, 1996.) In newly formed bone, \nthe phosphate content is low, and increases with maturity. While mature \nbone has an apatite-like ratio of calcium and phosphate, newly calcified \nbone is very deficient in phosphate (according to Dallemagne, the initial \ncalcium to phosphorus ratio is 1.29, and it increases to 2.20.) (G. \nBourne, 1972; Dallemagne.) The \ncarbonate content of bone is often ignored, but in newly formed bone, \nit is probably the pioneer. Normally, \"nucleation\" of crystals \nis thought of as a physical event in a supersaturated solution, but \nthe chemical interaction between carbon dioxide and amino groups (amino \nacids, protein, or ammonia, for example) removes the carbon dioxide \nfrom solution, and the carbamino acid formed becomes a bound anion with \nwhich calcium can form a salt. With normal physiological buffering, \nthe divalent calcium (Ca2+) should form a link between the monovalent \ncarbamino acid and another anion. Linking with carbonate (CO32-), one \nvalence would be free to continue the salt-chain. This sort of chemistry \nis compatible with the known conditions of bone formation. Klein, \net al. (1996), think of uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation in terms \nof \"subtle thermogenesis,\" which isn't demonstrated in their \nexperiment, but their experiment actually suggests that stimulated production \nof carbon dioxide is the factor that stimulates calcification. Their \nexperiment seems to be the in vitro equivalent of the various observations \nmentioned above. DHEA, which powerfully stimulates bone formation, is \n(like thyroid and progesterone) thermogenic, but in these cases, the \nrelevant event is probably the stimulation of respiration, not the heat \nproduction. In pigs (Landrace strain) susceptible to malignant hyperthermia, \nthere is slow removal of calcium from the contractile apparatus of their \nmuscles. Recent evidence shows that an extramitochondrial NADH-oxidase \nis functioning. This indicates that carbon dioxide production is limited. \nI think this is responsible for the cells' sluggishness in expelling \ncalcium. Stress-susceptible pigs show abnormalities \nof muscle metabolism (e.g., high lactate formation) that are consistent \nwith hypothyroidism. (T. E. Nelson, et al., \"Porcine malignant \nhyperthermia: Observations on the occurrence of pale, soft, exudative \nmusculature among susceptible pigs,\" Am. J. Vet. Res. 35, 347-350, \n1974; M. D. Judge, et al., \"Adrenal and thyroid function in stress-susceptible \npigs (Sus domesticus),\" Am. J. Physiol. 214(1), 146-151, 1968.) Malignant \nhyperthermia during surgery is usually blamed on genetic susceptibility \nand sensitivity to anesthetics. (R. D. Wilson, et al., \"Malignant \nhyperpyrexia with anesthesia,\" JAMA 202, 183-186, 1967; B.A Britt \nand W. Kalow, \"Malignant hyperthermia: aetiology unknown,\" \n\nCanad. Anaesth. Soc. J. 17, 316-330, 1970.) Hypertonicity of muscles, \nvarious degrees of myopathy and rigidity, and uncoupling of oxidative \nphosphorylation occur in these people, as in pigs. Lactic acidosis suggests \nthat mitochondrial respiration is defective in the people, as in the \npigs. Besides the sensitivity to anesthetics, the muscles of these people \nare abnormally sensitive to caffeine and elevated extracellular potassium. \nDuring surgery, artificial ventilation, combined with stress, toxic \nanesthetics, and any extramitochondrial oxidation that might be occurring \n(such as NADH-oxidase, which produces no CO2), make relative hyperventilation \na plausible explanation for the development of hyperthermia. Hyperventilation \ncan cause muscle contraction. Panting causes a tendency for fingers \nand toes to cramp. Free intracellular calcium is the trigger for muscle \ncontraction (and magnesium is an important factor in relaxation.) Capillary \ntone, similarly, is increased by hyperventilation, and relaxed by carbon \ndioxide. The muscle-relaxing effect of carbon dioxide shows that the \nbinding of intracellular calcium is promoted by carbon dioxide, as well \nas by ATP. The binding of calcium in a way that makes it unable to interfere \nwith cellular metabolism is, in a sense, a variant of simple extrusion \nof calcium, and the binding of calcium to extracellular materials. A \nrelaxed muscle and a strong bone are characterized by bound calcium. Activation \nof the sympathetic nervous system promotes hyperventilation. This means \nthat hypothyroidism, with high adrenalin (resulting from a tendency \ntoward hypoglycemia because of inefficient use of glucose and oxygen), \npredisposes to hyperventilation. Muscle \nstiffness, muscle soreness and weakness, and osteoporosis all seem to \nbe consequences of inadequate respiration, allowing lactic acid to be \nproduced instead of carbon dioxide. Insomnia, hyperactivity, anxiety, \nand many chronic brain conditions also show evidence of defective respiration, \nfor example, either slow consumption of glucose or the formation of \nlactic acid, both of which are common consequences of low thyroid function. \nSeveral studies (e.g., Jacono and Robertson, 1987) suggest that abnormal \ncalcium regulation is involved in epilepsy. The combination of supplements \nof thyroid (emphasizing T3), magnesium, progesterone and pregnenolone \ncan usually restore normal respiration, and it seems clear that this \nshould normalize calcium metabolism, decreasing the calcification of \nsoft tissues, increasing the calcification of bones, and improving the \nefficiency of muscles and nerves. (Magnesium, like carbonate, is a component \nof newly formed bone.) The avoidance of polyunsaturated vegetable oils \nis important for protecting respiration; some of the prostaglandins \nthey produce have been implicated in osteoporosis, but more generally, \nthey antagonize thyroid function and they can interfere with calcium \ncontrol. The presence of the \"Mead acid\" (the omega-9 unsaturated \nfat our enzymes synthesize) in cartilage suggests a new line of investigation \nregarding the bone-toxicity of the polyunsaturated dietary oils.

        "chunk_html": "Progesterone Pregnenolone & DHEA - Three Youth-Associated HormonesPROGESTERONE INFORMATION Raymond Peat, MA, PhD (Univ. of \nOregon) Endocrine Physiologist, specializing \nin hormonal changes in stress and aging Sixty \nyears ago, progesterone was found to be the main hormone produced by \nthe ovaries.  Since it was necessary for fertility and for maintaining \na healthy pregnancy, it was called the \"pro-gestational hormone,\" \nand its name sometimes leads people to think that it isn't needed when \nyou don't want to get pregnant.  In fact, it is the most protective \nhormone the body produces, and the large amounts that are produced during \npregnancy result from the developing baby's need for protection from \nthe stressful environment.  Normally, the brain contains a very \nhigh concentration of progesterone, reflecting its protective function \nfor that most important organ.  The thymus gland, the key organ \nof our immune system, is also profoundly dependent on progesterone. In \nexperiments, progesterone was found to be the basic hormone of adaptation \nand of resistance to stress.  The adrenal glands use it to produce \ntheir anti-stress hormones, and when there is enough progesterone, they \ndon't have to produce the potentially harmful cortisone.  In a \nprogesterone deficiency, we produce too much cortisone, and excessive \ncortisone causes osteoporosis, aging of the skin, damage to brain cells, \nand the accumulation of fat, especially on the back and abdomen. Experiments \nhave shown that progesterone relieves anxiety, improves memory, protects \nbrain cells, and even prevents epileptic seizures.  It promotes \nrespiration, and has been used to correct emphysema.  In the circulatory \nsystem, it prevents bulging veins by increasing the tone of blood vessels, \nand improves the efficiency of the heart.  It reverses many of \nthe signs of aging in the skin, and promotes healthy bone growth.  \nIt can relieve many types of arthritis, and helps a variety of immunological \nproblems. If \nprogesterone is taken dissolved in vitamin E, it is absorbed very efficiently, \nand distributed quickly to all of the tissues.  If a woman has \novaries, progesterone helps them to produce both progesterone and estrogen \nas needed, and also helps to restore normal functioning of the thyroid \nand other glands.  If her ovaries have been removed, progesterone \nshould be taken consistently to replace the lost supply.  A progesterone \ndeficiency has often been associated with increased susceptibility to \ncancer, and progesterone has been used to treat some types of cancer. It \nis important to emphasize that progesterone is not just the hormone \nof pregnancy.  To use it only \"to protect the uterus\" \n\nwould be like telling a man he doesn't need testosterone if he doesn't \nplan to father children, except that progesterone is of far greater \nand more basic significance than testosterone.  While men do naturally \nproduce progesterone, and can sometimes benefit from using it, it is \nnot a male hormone.  Some people get that impression, because some \nphysicians recommend combining estrogen with either testosterone or \nprogesterone, to protect against some of estrogen's side effects, but \nprogesterone is the body's natural complement to estrogen.  Used \nalone, progesterone often makes it unnecessary to use estrogen for hot \nflashes or insomnia, or other symptoms of menopause. When \ndissolved in vitamin E, progesterone begins entering the blood stream \nalmost as soon as it contacts any membrane, such as the lips, tongue, \ngums, or palate, but when it is swallowed, it continues to be absorbed \nas part of the digestive process.  When taken with food, its absorption \noccurs at the same rate as the digestion and absorption of the food. PREGNENOLONE Pregnenolone, \nwhich is the raw material for producing many of the hormones of stress \nand adaptation, was known as early as 1934, but for several years it \nwas considered to be an \"inert\" substance.  A reason \nfor this belief is that it was first tested on healthy young animals.  \nSince these animals were already producing large amounts of pregnenolone \n(in the brain, adrenal glands, and gonads), additional pregnenolone \nhad no effect. In \nthe 1940s, pregnenolone was tested in people who were sick or under \nstress, and it was found to have a wide range of beneficial actions, \nbut the drug industry never had much interest in it.  Its very \ngenerality made it seem unlike a drug, and its natural occurrence made \nit impossible to patent.  Thus, many synthetic variants, each with \na more specialized action and some serious side effects, came to be \npatented and promoted for use in treating specific conditions.  \nThe drug companies created an atmosphere in which many people felt that \neach disease should have a drug, and each drug, a disease.  The \nside effects of some of those synthetic hormones were so awful that \nmany people came to fear them.  For example, synthetic varieties \nof \"cortisone\" can destroy immunity, and can cause osteoporosis, \ndiabetes, and rapid aging, with loss of pigment in the skin and hair, \nand extreme thinning of the skin. Natural \npregnenolone is present in young people of both sexes at a very high \nconcentration, and one reason for the large amount produced in youth \nis that it is one of our basic defenses against the harmful side effects \nthat an imbalance of even our natural hormones can produce.  In \nexcess, natural cortisone or estrogen can be dangerous, but when there \nis an abundance of pregnenolone, their side effects are prevented or \nminimized. In \na healthy young person or animal, taking even a large dose of pregnenolone \nhas no hormone-like or drug-like action at all.  It is unique in \nthis way.  But if the animal or person is under stress, and producing \nmore cortisone than usual, taking pregnenolone causes the cortisone \nto come down to the normal level.  After the age of 40 or 45, it \nseems that everyone lives in a state of continuous \"stress,\" \njust as a normal part of aging.  This coincides with the body's \ndecreased ability to produce an abundance of pregnenolone. When \naging rats are given a supplement of pregnenolone, it immediately improves \ntheir memory and general performance.  Human studies, as early \nas the 1940s, have also demonstrated improved performance of ordinary \ntasks.  It is now known that pregnenolone is one of the major hormones \nin the brain.  It is produced by certain brain cells, as well as \nbeing absorbed into the brain from the blood.  It protects brain \ncells from injury caused by fatigue, and an adequate amount has a calming \neffect on the emotions, which is part of the reason that it protects \nus from the stress response that leads to an excessive production of \ncortisone.  People feel a mood of resilience and an ability to \nconfront challenges. Many \npeople have noticed that pregnenolone has a \"face-lifting\" \naction.  This effect seems to be produced by improved circulation \nto the skin, and by an actual contraction of some muscle-like cells \nin the skin.  A similar effect can improve joint mobility in arthritis, \ntissue elasticity in the lungs, and even eyesight.  Many studies \nhave shown it to be protective of \"fibrous tissues\" in general, \nand in this connection it was proven to prevent the tumors that can \nbe caused by estrogen. Pregnenolone \nis largely converted into two other \"youth-associated\" protective \nhormones, progesterone and DHEA.  At the age of 30, both men and \nwomen produce roughly 30 to 50 mg. of pregnenolone daily.  When \ntaken orally, even in the powdered form, it is absorbed fairly well.  \nOne dose of approximately 300 mg (the size of an aspirin tablet) keeps \nacting for about a week, as absorption continues along the intestine, \nand as it is \"recycled\" in the body.  Part of this long \nlasting effect is because it improves the body's ability to produce \nits own pregnenolone.  It tends to improve function of the thyroid \nand other glands, and this \"normalizing\" effect on the other \nglands helps to account for its wide range of beneficial effects. DHEA:  ANOTHER YOUTH-ASSOCIATED \nHORMONE Raymond Peat, MA, PhD (Univ. of \nOregon) Endocrine Physiologist DHEA \n(dehydroepiandrosterone) has a technical-sounding name because it has \nnever been identified with a single dominant function, in spite of its \nabundance in the body.  Many researchers still think of it as a \nsubstance produced by the adrenal glands, but experiments show that \nanimals without adrenals are able to produce it in normal amounts.  \nMuch of it is formed in the brain (from pregnenolone), but it is probably \nproduced in other organs, including the skin.  The brain contains \na much higher concentration of DHEA than the blood does. In \nold age, we produce only about 5% as much as we do in youth.  This \nis about the same decrease that occurs with progesterone and pregnenolone.  \nThe other hormones (for example, cortisone) do not decrease so much; \nas a result, our balance shifts continually during aging toward dominance \nby hormones such as cortisone, which use up more and more body substance, \nwithout rebuilding it.  Protection against the toxic actions of \nthese specialized hormones is a major function of DHEA and the other \nyouth-associated hormones. For \nexample, starvation, aging, and stress cause the skin to become thin \nand fragile.  An excess of cortisone--whether it is from medical \ntreatment, or from stress, aging, or malnutrition--does the same thing.  \nMaterial from the skin is dissolved to provide nutrition for the more \nessential organs.  Other organs, such as the muscles and bones, \ndissolve more slowly, but just as destructively, under the continued \ninfluence of cortisone.  DHEA blocks these destructive effects \nof cortisone, and actively restores the normal growth and repair processes \nto those organs, strengthening the skin and bones and other organs.  \nStimulation of bone-growth by DHEA has been demonstrated in vitro (in \nlaboratory tests), and it has been used to relieve many symptoms caused \nby osteoporosis and arthritis, even when applied topically in an oily \nsolution. Estrogen \nis known to produce a great variety of immunological defects, and DHEA, \napparently by its balancing and restorative actions, is able to correct \nsome of those immunological defects, including some \"autoimmune\" \ndiseases. It \nis established that DHEA protects against cancer, but it isn't yet understood \nhow it does this.  It appears to protect against the toxic cancer-producing \neffects of excess estrogen, but its anti-cancer properties probably \ninvolve many other functions. Diabetes \ncan be produced experimentally by certain poisons which kill the insulin-producing \ncells in the pancreas.  Rabbits were experimentally made diabetic, \nand when treated with DHEA their diabetes was cured.  It was found \nthat the insulin-producing cells had regenerated.  Many people \nwith diabetes have used brewer's yeast and DHEA to improve their sugar \nmetabolism.  In diabetes, very little sugar enters the cells, so \nfatigue is a problem.  DHEA stimulates cells to absorb sugar and \nto burn it, so it increases our general energy level and helps to prevent \nobesity. Young \npeople produce about 12 to 15 milligrams of DHEA per day, and that amount \ndecreases by about 2 mg. per day for every decade after the age of 30.  \nThis is one of the reasons that young people eat more without getting \nfat, and tolerate cold weather better:  DHEA, like the thyroid \nhormone, increases our heat production and ability to burn calories.  \nAt the age of 50, about 4 mg. of DHEA per day will usually restore the \nlevel of DHEA in the blood to a youthful level.  It is important \nto avoid taking more than needed, since some people (especially if they \nare deficient in progesterone, pregnenolone, or thyroid) can turn the \nexcess into estrogen or testosterone, and large amounts of those sex \nhormones can disturb the function of the thymus gland and the liver. People \nwho have taken an excess of DHEA have been found to have abnormally \nhigh estrogen levels, and this can cause the liver to enlarge, and the \nthymus to shrink. One \nstudy has found that the only hormone abnormality in a groupt of Alzheimers \npatients' brains was an excess of DHEA.  In cell culture, DHEA \ncan cause changes in glial cells resembling those seen in the aging \nbrain.  These observations suggest that DHEA should be used with \ncaution.  Supplements of pregnenolone and thyroid seem to be the \nsafest way to optimize DHEA production. © Ray Peat 2006. All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com",

Events in the tissuesV.    TherapiesVI.   DiagnosisI. Respiratory defectBroda Barnes, more than 60 years ago, summed up the major effects of\n\nhypothyroidism on health very neatly when he pointed out that if\n\nhypothyroid people don't die young from infectious diseases, such as\n\ntuberculosis, they die a little later from cancer or heart disease.  He did\n\nhis PhD research at the University of Chicago, just a few years after Otto\n\nWarburg, in Germany, had demonstrated the role of a \"respiratory defect\" in\n\ncancer.  At the time Barnes was doing his research, hypothyroidism was\n\ndiagnosed on the basis of a low basal metabolic rate, meaning that only a\n\nsmall amount of oxygen was needed to sustain life.  This deficiency of\n\noxygen consumption involved the same enzyme system that Warburg was\n\nstudying in cancer cells.Barnes experimented on rabbits, and found that when their thyroid glands\n\nwere removed, they developed atherosclerosis, just as hypothyroid people\n\ndid.  By the mid-1930s, it was generally known that hypothyroidism causes\n\nthe cholesterol level in the blood to increase; hypercholesterolemia was a\n\ndiagnostic sign of hypothyroidism.  Administering a thyroid supplement,\n\nblood cholesterol came down to normal exactly as the basal metabolic rate\n\ncame up to the normal rate.  The biology of atherosclerotic heart disease\n\nwas basically solved before the second world war.Many other diseases are now known to be caused by respiratory defects.\n\nInflammation, stress, immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, developmental and\n\ndegenerative diseases, and aging, all involve significantly abnormal\n\noxidative processes.  Just brief oxygen deprivation triggers processes that\n\nlead to lipid peroxidation, producing a chain of other oxidative reactions\n\nwhen oxygen is restored.  The only effective way to stop lipid peroxidation\n\nis to restore normal respiration.Now that dozens of diseases are known to involve defective respiration, the\n\nidea of thyroid's extremely broad range of actions is becoming easier to\n\naccept.II.   50 years of fraudUntil the second world war, hypothyroidism was diagnosed on the basis of\n\nBMR (basal metabolic rate) and a large group of signs and symptoms.  In the\n\nlate 1940s, promotion of the (biologically inappropriate) PBI\n\n(protein-bound iodine) blood test in the U.S. led to the concept that only\n\n5% of the population were hypothyroid, and that the 40% identified by\n\n\"obsolete\" methods were either normal, or suffered from other problems such\n\nas sloth and gluttony, or \"genetic susceptibility\" to disease.  \n\nDuring the same period, thyroxine became available, and in healthy young\n\nmen it acted \"like the thyroid hormone.\"  Older practitioners recognized\n\nthat it was not metabolically the same as the traditional thyroid\n\nsubstance, especially for women and seriously hypothyroid patients, but\n\nmarketing, and its influence on medical education, led to the false idea\n\nthat the standard Armour thyroid USP wasn't properly standardized, and that\n\ncertain thyroxine products were; despite the fact that both of these were\n\nshown to be false.By the 1960s, the PBI test was proven to be irrelevant to the diagnosis of\n\nhypothyroidism, but the doctrine of 5% hypothyroidism in the populaton\n\nbecame the basis for establishing the norms for biologically meaningful\n\ntests when they were introduced.Meanwhile, the practice of measuring serum iodine, and equating it with\n\n\"thyroxine the thyroid hormone,\" led to the practice of examining only the\n\niodine content of the putative glandular material that was offered for sale\n\nas thyroid USP.  This led to the substitution of materials such as\n\niodinated casein for desiccated thyroid in the products sold as thyroid\n\nUSP.  The US FDA refused to take action, because they held that a\n\nmaterial's iodine content was enough to identify it as \"thyroid USP.\" \n\nIn this culture of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, the mistaken\n\nidea of hypothyroidism's low incidence in the population led to the\n\nacceptance of dangerously high TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) activity\n\nas \"normal.\"  Just as excessive FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) has been\n\nshown to have a role in ovarian cancer, excessive stimulation by TSH\n\nproduces disorganization in the thyroid gland.III. Tests & the \"free hormone hypothesis\"After radioactive iodine became available, many physicians would administer\n\na dose, and then scan the body with a Geiger counter, to see if it was\n\nbeing concentrated in the thyroid gland.  If a person had been eating\n\niodine-rich food (and iodine was used in bread as a preservative/dough\n\ncondition, and was present in other foods as an accidental contaminant),\n\nthey would already be over saturated with iodine, and the gland would fail\n\nto concentrate the iodine.  The test can find some types of metastatic\n\nthyroid cancer, but the test generally wasn't used for that purpose.\n\nAnother expensive and entertaining test has been the thyrotropin release\n\nhormone (TRH) test, to see if the pituitary responds to it by increasing\n\nTSH production.  A recent study concluded that \"TRH test gives many\n\nmisleading results and has an elevated cost/benefit ratio as compared with\n\nthe characteristic combination of low thyroxinemia and non-elevated TSH.\"\n\n(Bakiri, Ann. Endocr (Paris) 1999), but the technological drama, cost, and\n\ndanger (Dokmetas, et al., J Endocrinol Invest 1999 Oct; 22(9): 698-700) of\n\nthis test is going to make it stay popular for a long time.  If the special\n\nvalue of the test is to diagnose a pituitary abnormality, it seems\n\nintuitively obvious that overstimulating the pituitary might not be a good\n\nidea (e.g., it could cause a tumor to grow).Everything else being equal, as they say, looking at the amount of\n\nthyroxine and TSH in the blood can be informative.  The problem is that\n\nit's just a matter of faith that \"everything else\" is going to be equal.\n\nThe exceptions to the \"rule\" regarding normal ranges for thyroxine and TSH\n\nhave formed the basis for some theories about \"the genetics of thyroid\n\nresistance,\" but others have pointed out that, when a few other things are\n\ntaken into account, abnormal numbers for T4, T3, TSH, can be variously\n\nexplained.The actual quantity of T3, the active thyroid hormone, in the blood can be\n\nmeasured with reasonable accuracy (using radioimmunoassay, RIA), and this\n\nsingle test corresponds better to the metabolic rate and other meaningful\n\nbiological responses than other standard tests do.  But still, this is only\n\na statistical correspondence, and it doesn't indicate that any particular\n\nnumber is right for a particular individual.Sometimes, a test called the RT3U, or resin T3 uptake, is used, along with\n\na measurement of thyroxine.  A certain amount of radioactive T3 is added to\n\na sample of serum, and then an adsorbent material is exposed to the\n\nmixture of serum and radioactive T3.  The amount of radioactivity that\n\nsticks to the resin is called the T3 uptake.  The lab report then gives a\n\nnumber called T7, or free thyroxine index.  The closer this procedure is\n\nexamined, the sillier it looks, and it looks pretty silly on its face.. \n\nThe idea that the added radioactive T3 that sticks to a piece of resin will\n\ncorrespond to \"free thyroxine,\" is in itself odd, but the really\n\ninteresting question is, what do they mean by \"free thyroxine\"? \n\nThyroxine is a fairly hydrophobic (insoluble in water) substance, that will\n\nassociate with proteins, cells, and lipoproteins in the blood, rather than\n\ndissolving in the water.  Although the Merck Index describes it as\n\n\"insoluble in water,\" it does contain some polar groups that, in  the right\n\n(industrial or laboratory) conditions, can make it slightly water soluble.\n\nThis makes it a little different from progesterone, which is simply and\n\nthoroughly insoluble in water, though the term \"free hormone\" is often\n\napplied to progesterone, as it is to thyroid.  In the case of progesterone,\n\nthe term \"free progesterone\" can be traced to experiments in which serum\n\ncontaining progesterone (bound to proteins) is separated by a (dialysis)\n\nmembrane from a solution of similar proteins which contain no progesterone. \n\nProgesterone \"dissolves in\" the substance of the membrane, and the serum\n\nproteins, which also tend to associate with the membrane, are so large that\n\nthey don't pass through it.  On the other side, proteins coming in contact\n\nwith the membrane pick up some progesterone.  The progesterone that passes\n\nthrough is called \"free progesterone,\" but from that experiment, which\n\ngives no information on the nature of the interactions between progesterone\n\nand the dialysis membrane, or about its interactions with the proteins, or\n\nthe proteins' interactions with the membrane, nothing is revealed about the\n\nreasons for the transmission or exchange of a certain amount of\n\nprogesterone.  Nevertheless, that type of experiment is used to interpret\n\nwhat happens in the body, where there is nothing that corresponds to the\n\nexperimental set-up, except that some progesterone is associated with some\n\nprotein.The idea that the \"free hormone\" is the active form has been tested in a\n\nfew situations, and in the case of the thyroid hormone, it is clearly not\n\ntrue for the brain, and some other organs.  The protein-bound hormone is,\n\nin these cases, the active form; the associations between the \"free\n\nhormone\" and the biological processes and diseases will be completely\n\nfalse, if they are ignoring the active forms of the hormone in favor of the\n\nless active forms.  The conclusions will be false, as they are when T4 is\n\nmeasured, and T3 ignored.  Thyroid-dependent processes will appear to be\n\nindependent of the level of thyroid hormone; hypothyroidism could be caller\n\nhyperthyroidism.Although progesterone is more fat soluble than cortisol and the thyroid\n\nhormones, the behavior of progesterone in the blood illustrates some of the\n\nproblems that have to be considered for interpreting thyroid physiology.\n\nWhen red cells are broken up, they are found to contain progesterone at\n\nabout twice the concentration of the serum.  In the serum, 40 to 80% of the\n\nprogesterone is probably carried on albumin.  (Albumin easily delivers its\n\nprogesterone load into tissues.)  Progesterone, like cholesterol, can be\n\ncarried on/in the lipoproteins, in moderate quantities.  This leaves a very\n\nsmall fraction to be bound to the \"steroid binding globulin.\"  Anyone who\n\nhas tried to dissolve progesterone in various solvents and mixtures knows\n\nthat it takes just a tiny amount of water in a solvent to make progesterone\n\nprecipitate from solution as crystals; its solubility in water is\n\nessentially zero.  \"Free\" progesterone would seem to mean progesterone not\n\nattached to proteins or dissolved in red blood cells or lipoproteins, and\n\nthis would be zero.  The tests that purport to measure free progesterone\n\nare measuring something, but not the progesterone in the watery fraction of\n\nthe serum.The thyroid hormones associate with three types of simple proteins in the\n\nserum: Transthyretin (prealbumin), thyroid binding globulin, and albumin.\n\nA very significant amount is also associated with various serum\n\nlipoproteins, including HDL, LDL, and VLDL (very low density lipoproteins). \n\nA very large portion of the thyroid in the blood is associated with the\n\nred blood cells.  When red cells were incubated in a medium containing\n\nserum albumin, with the cells at roughly the concentration found in the\n\nblood, they retained T3 at a concentration 13.5 times higher than that of\n\nthe medium.  In a larger amount of medium, their concentration of T3 was 50\n\ntimes higher than the medium's.  When laboratories measure the hormones in\n\nthe serum only, they have already thrown out about 95% of the thyroid\n\nhormone that the blood contained.The T3 was found to be strongly associated with the cells' cytoplasmic\n\nproteins, but to move rapidly between the proteins inside the cells and\n\nother proteins outside the cells.When people speak of hormones travelling \"on\" the red blood cells, rather\n\nthan \"in\" them, it is a concession to the doctrine of the impenetrable\n\nmembrane barrier.Much more T3 bound to albumin is taken up by the liver than the small\n\namount identified in vitro as free T3 (Terasaki, et al., 1987).  The\n\nspecific binding of T3 to albumin alters the protein's electrical\n\nproperties, changing the way the albumin interacts with cells and other\n\nproteins.  (Albumin becomes electrically more positive when it binds the\n\nhormone; this would make the albumin enter cells more easily.  Giving up\n\nits T3 to the cell, it would become more negative, making it tend to leave\n\nthe cell.)   This active role of albumin in helping cells take up T3 might\n\naccount for its increased uptake by the red cells when there were fewer\n\ncells in proportion to the albumin medium.  This could also account for the\n\nfavorable prognosis associated with higher levels of serum albumin in\n\nvarious sicknesses.When T3 is attached chemically (covalently, permanently) to the outside of\n\nred blood cells, apparently preventing its entry into other cells, the\n\npresence of these red cells produces reactions in other cells that are the\n\nsame as some of those produced by the supposedly \"free hormone.\"  If T3\n\nattached to whole cells can exert its hormonal action, why should we think\n\nof the hormone bound to proteins as being unable to affect cells?\n\nThe idea of measuring the \"free hormone\" is that it supposedly represents\n\nthe biologically active hormone, but in fact it is easier to measure the\n\nbiological effects than it is to measure this hypothetical entity.  Who\n\ncares how many angels might be dancing on the head of a pin, if the pin is\n\neffective in keeping your shirt closed?IV.   Events in the tissuesBesides the effects of commercial deception, confusion about thyroid has\n\nresulted from some biological clichés.  The idea of a \"barrier membrane\"\n\naround cells is an assumption that has affected most people studying cell\n\nphysiology, and its effects can be seen in nearly all of the thousands of\n\npublications on the functions of thyroid hormones.  According to this idea,\n\npeople have described a cell as resembling a droplet of a watery solution,\n\nenclosed in an oily bag which separates the internal solution from the\n\nexternal watery solution.   The cliché is sustained only by neglecting the\n\nfact that proteins have a great affinity for fats, and fats for proteins;\n\neven soluble proteins, such as serum albumin, often have interiors that are\n\nextremely fat-loving.  Since the structural proteins that make up the\n\nframework of a cell aren't \"dissolved in water\" (they used to be called\n\n\"the insoluble proteins\"), the lipophilic phase isn't limited to an\n\nultramicroscopically thin surface, but actually constitutes the bulk of the\n\ncell.Molecular geneticists like to trace their science from a 1944 experiment\n\nthat was done by Avery., et al.  Avery's group knew about an earlier\n\nexperiment, that had demonstrated that when dead bacteria were added to\n\nliving bacteria, the traits of the dead bacteria appeared in the living\n\nbacteria.  Avery's group extracted DNA from the dead bacteria, and showed\n\nthat adding it to living bacteria transferred the traits of the dead\n\norganisms to the living.In the 1930s and 1940s, the movement of huge molecules such as proteins and\n\nnucleic acids into cells and out of cells wasn't a big deal; people\n\nobserved it happening, and wrote about it.  But in the 1940s the idea of\n\nthe barrier membrane began gaining strength, and by the 1960s nothing was\n\nable to get into cells without authorization.  At present, I doubt that any\n\nmolecular geneticist would dream of doing a gene transplant without a\n\n\"vector\" to carry it across the membrane barrier.Since big molecules are supposed to be excluded from cells, it's only the\n\n\"free hormone\" which can find its specific port of entry into the cell,\n\nwhere another cliché says it must travel into the nucleus, to react with a\n\nspecific site to activate the specific genes through which its effects will\n\nbe expressed.I don't know of any hormone that acts that way.  Thyroid, progesterone, and\n\nestrogen have many immediate effects that change the cell's functions long\n\nbefore genes could be activated.Transthyretin, carrying the thyroid hormone, enters the cell's mitochondria\n\nand nucleus (Azimova, et al., 1984, 1985).  In the nucleus, it immediately\n\ncauses generalized changes in the structure of chromosomes, as if preparing\n\nthe cell for major adaptive changes.  Respiratory activation is immediate\n\nin the mitochondria, but as respiration is stimulated, everything in the\n\ncell responds, including the genes that support respiratory metabolism.\n\nWhen the membrane people have to talk about the entry of large molecules\n\ninto cells, they use terms such as \"endocytosis\" and \"translocases,\" that\n\nincorporate the assumption of the barrier.  But people who actually\n\ninvestigate the problem generally find that \"diffusion,\" \"codiffusion,\" and\n\nabsorption describe the situation adequately (e.g., B.A. Luxon, 1997;\n\nMcLeese and Eales, 1996).  \"Active transport\" and \"membrane pumps\" are\n\nideas that seem necessary to people who haven't studied the complex forces\n\nthat operate at phase boundaries, such as the boundary between a cell and\n\nits environment.V.  TherapyYears ago it was reported that Armour thyroid, U.S.P., released T3 and T4,\n\nwhen digested, in a ratio of 1:3, and that people who used it had much\n\nhigher ratios of T3 to T4 in their serum, than people who took only\n\nthyroxine.  The argument was made that thyroxine was superior to thyroid\n\nU.S.P., without explaining the significance of the fact that healthy people\n\nwho weren't taking any thyroid supplement had higher T3:T4 ratios than the\n\npeople who took thyroxine, or that our own thyroid gland releases a high\n\nratio of T3 to T4.  The fact that the T3 is being used faster than T4,\n\nremoving it from the blood more quickly than it enters from the thyroid\n\ngland itself, hasn't been discussed in the journals, possibly because it\n\nwould support the view that a natural glandular balance was more\n\nappropriate to supplement than pure thyroxine.The serum's high ratio of T4 to T3 is a pitifully poor argument to justify\n\nthe use of thyroxine instead of a product that resembles the proportion of\n\nthese substances secreted by a healthy thyroid gland, or maintained inside\n\ncells.  About 30 years ago, when many people still thought of thyroxine as\n\n\"the thryoid hormone,\" someone was making the argument that \"the thyroid\n\nhormone\" must work exclusively as an activator of genes, since most of the\n\norgan slices he tested didn't increase their oxygen consumption when it was\n\nadded.  In fact, the addition of thyroxine to brain slices suppressed their\n\nrespiration by 6% during the experiment.  Since most T3 is produced from T4\n\nin the liver, not in the brain, I think that experiment had great\n\nsignificance, despite the ignorant interpretation of the author.  An excess\n\nof thyroxine, in a tissue that doesn't convert it rapidly to T3, has an\n\nantithyroid action.  (See Goumaz, et al, 1987.)  This happens in many women\n\nwho are given thyroxine; as their dose is increased, their symptoms get\n\nworse.The brain concentrates T3 from the serum, and may have a concentration 6\n\ntimes higher than the serum (Goumaz, et al., 1987), and it can achieve a\n\nhigher concentration of T3 than T4.  It takes up and concentrates T3, while\n\ntending to expel T4.  Reverse T3 (rT3) doesn't have much ability to enter\n\nthe brain, but increased T4 can cause it to be produced in the brain.\n\nThese observations suggest to me that the blood's T3:T4 ratio would be very\n\n\"brain favorable\" if it approached more closely to the ratio formed in the\n\nthyroid gland, and secreted into the blood.  Although most synthetic\n\ncombination thyroid products now use a ratio of four T4 to one T3, many\n\npeople feel that their memory and thinking are clearer when they take a\n\nratio of about three to one.  More active metabolism probably keeps the\n\nblood ratio of T3 to T4 relatively high, with the liver consuming T4 at\n\nabout the same rate that T3 is used.Since T3 has a short half life, it should be taken frequently.  If the\n\nliver isn't producing a noticeable amount of T3, it is usually helpful to\n\ntake a few micorgrams per hour.  Since it restores respiration and\n\nmetabolic efficiency very quickly, it isn't usually necessary to take it\n\nevery hour or two, but until normal temperature and pulse have been\n\nachieved and stabilized, sometimes it's necessary to take it four or more\n\ntimes during the day.  T4 acts by being changed to T3, so it tends to\n\naccumulate in the body, and on a given dose, usually reaches a steady\n\nconcentration after about two weeks.An effective way to use supplements is to take a combination T4-T3 dose,\n\ne.g., 40 mcg of T4 and 10 mcg of T3 once a day, and to use a few mcg of T3\n\nat other times in the day.  Keeping a 14-day chart of pulse rate and\n\ntemperature allows you to see whether the dose is producing the desired\n\nresponse.  If the figures aren't increasing at all after a few days, the\n\ndose can be increased, until a gradual daily increment can be seen, moving\n\ntoward the goal at the rate of about 1/14 per dayVI.  DiagnosisIn the absence of  commercial techniques that reflect thyroid physiology\n\nrealistically, there is no valid alternative to diagnosis based on the\n\nknown physiological indicators of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.   The\n\nfailure to treat sick people because of one or another blood test that\n\nindicates \"normal thyroid function,\" or the destruction of patients'\n\nhealthy thyroid glands because one of the tests indicates hyperthyroidism,\n\nisn't acceptable just because it's the professional standard, and is\n\nenforced by benighted state licensing boards.Toward the end of the twentieth century, there has been considerable\n\ndiscussion of \"evidence-based medicine.\"  Good judgment requires good\n\ninformation, but there are forces that would over-rule individual judgment\n\nas to whether published information is applicable to certain patients.  In\n\nan atmosphere that sanctions prescribing estrogen or insulin without\n\nevidence of an estrogen deficiency or insulin deficiency, but that\n\npenalizes practitioners who prescribe thyroid to correct symptoms, the\n\npublished \"evidence\" is necessarily heavily biased.  In this context,\n\n\"meta-analysis\" becomes a tool of authoritarianism, replacing the use of\n\njudgment with the improper use of statistical analysis.Unless someone can demonstrate the scientific invalidity of the methods\n\nused to diagnose hypothyroidism up to 1945, then they constitute the best\n\npresent evidence for evaluating hypothyroidism, because all of the blood\n\ntests that have been used since 1950 have been.shown to be, at best, very\n\ncrude and conceptually inappropriate methods.Thomas H. McGavack's 1951 book, The Thyroid, was representative of the\n\nearlier approach to the study of thyroid physiology.  Familiarity with the\n\ndifferent effects of abnormal thyroid function under different conditions,\n\nat different ages, and the effects of gender, were standard parts of\n\nmedical education that had disappeared by the end of the century.\n\nArthritis, irregularities of growth, wasting, obesity, a variety of\n\nabnormalities of the hair and skin, carotenemia, amenorrhea, tendency to\n\nmiscarry, infertility in males and females,  insomnia or somnolence,\n\nemphysema, various heart diseases, psychosis, dementia, poor memory,\n\nanxiety, cold extremities, anemia, and many other problems were known\n\nreasons to suspect hypothyroidism.  If the physician didn't have a device\n\nfor measuring oxygen consumption, estimated calorie intake could provide\n\nsupporting evidence.  The Achilles' tendon reflex was another simple\n\nobjective measurement with a very strong correlation to the basal metabolic\n\nrate.  Skin electrical resistance, or whole body impedance wasn't widely\n\naccepted, though it had considerable scientific validity.A therapeutic trial was the final test of the validity of the diagnosis: If\n\nthe patient's symptoms disappeared as his temperature and pulse rate and\n\nfood intake were normalized, the diagnostic hypothesis was confirmed.  It\n\nwas common to begin therapy with one or two grains of thyroid, and to\n\nadjust the dose according to the patient's response.  Whatever objective\n\nindicator was used, whether it was basal metabolic rate, or serum\n\ncholesterol. or core temperature, or reflex relaxation rate, a simple chart\n\nwould graphically indicate the rate of recovery toward normal health.REFERENCESMcGavack, Thomas Hodge.: The thyroid,: St. Louis, Mosby, 1951.  646 p.\n\nill.Several chapters contributed by various authors.Call Numbers WK200\n\nM145t 1951 (Rare Book).Endocrinology 1979 Sep; 105(3): 605-12.

The\n\neffect of tyroxin-binding prealbumin (TBPA) of blood serum on the template\n\nactivity of chromatin was studied. It was found that the values of binding\n\nconstants of TBPA for T3 and T4 are 2 X 10(-11) M and 5 X 10(-10) M,\n\nrespectively. The receptors isolated from 0.4 M KCl extract of chromatin\n\nand mitochondria as well as hormone-bound TBPA cause similar effects on the\n\ntemplate activity of chromatin. Based on experimental results and the\n\npreviously published comparative data on the structure of TBPA, nuclear,\n\ncytoplasmic and mitochondrial receptors of thyroid hormones as well as on\n\ntranslocation across the plasma membrane and intracellular transport of\n\nTBPA, a conclusion was drawn, which suggested that TBPA is the \"core\" of\n\nthe true thyroid hormone receptor. It was shown that T3-bound TBPA caused\n\nhistone H1-dependent conformational changes in chromatin.

It was found that\n\nthe external mitochondrial membranes and matrix contain a protein whose\n\nelectrophoretic mobility is similar to that of thyroxine-binding blood\n\nserum prealbumin (TBPA) and which binds either T4 or T3. This protein is\n\nprecipitated by monospecific antibodies against TBPA. The internal\n\nmitochondrial membrane has two proteins able to bind thyroid hormones, one\n\nof which is localized in the cathode part of the gel and binds only T3,\n\nwhile the second one capable of binding T4 rather than T3 and possessing\n\nthe electrophoretic mobility similar to that of TBPA.Radioimmunoprecipitation with monospecific antibodies against TBPA revealed\n\nthat this protein also the antigenic determinants common with those of\n\nTBPA. The in vivo translocation of 125I-TBPA into submitochondrial\n\nfractions was studied. The analysis of densitograms of submitochondrial\n\nprotein fraction showed that both TBPA and hormones are localized in the\n\nsame protein fractions. Electron microscopic autoradiography demonstrated\n\nthat 125I-TBPA enters the cytoplasm through the external membrane and is\n\nlocalized on the internal mitochondrial membrane and matrix.[The nature of thyroid hormone receptors.

The in vivo\n\ntranslocation of thyroxine- binding blood serum prealbumin (TBPA) was\n\nstudied. It was found that the TBPA-hormone complex penetrates-through the\n\nplasma membrane into the cytoplasm of target cells.

        "chunk_html": "Unsaturated Vegetable Oils: ToxicGLOSSARY: Immunodeficiency \n(weakness of the immune system) can take many forms.  AIDS, for \nexample, refers to an immunodeficiency which is \"acquired,\" \nrather than \"inborn.\"  Radiation and vegetable oils can \ncause \"acquired immunodeficiency.\"  Unsaturated oils, \nespecially polyunsaturates, weaken the immune system's function in ways \nthat are similar to the damage caused by radiation, hormone imbalance, \ncancer, aging, or viral infections.  The media discuss sexually  \ntransmitted  and  drug-induced  immunodeficiency, but \nit isn't yet considered polite to discuss vegetable oil-induced immunodeficiency.  Unsaturated \noils: When an oil is saturated, that means that the molecule has all \nthe hydrogen atoms it can hold.  Unsaturation means that some hydrogen \natoms have been removed, and this opens the structure of the molecule \nin a way that makes it susceptible to attack by free radicals. Free \nradicals are reactive molecular fragments that occur even in healthy \ncells, and can damage the cell.  When unsaturated oils are exposed \nto free radicals they can create chain reactions of free radicals that \nspread the damage in the cell, and contribute to the cell's aging. Rancidity \nof oils occurs when they are exposed to oxygen, in the body just as \nin the bottle.  Harmful free radicals are formed, and oxygen is \nused up. Essential \nfatty acids (EFA) are, according to the textbooks, linoleic acid and \nlinolenic acid, and they are supposed to have the status of \"vitamins,\" \nwhich must be taken in the diet to make life possible.  However, \nwe are able to synthesize our own unsaturated fats when we don't eat \nthe \"EFA,\" so they are not \"essential.\"  The \nterm thus appears to be a misnomer.  [M. E. Hanke, \"Biochemistry,\"  \nEncycl. Brit. Book of the Year, 1948.] Q:  You say vegetable oils \nare hazardous to your health.  What vegetable oils are you talking \nabout? Mainly, \nI'm referring to soybean oil, corn oil, safflower oil, canola, sesame \noil, sunflower seed oil, palm oil, and any others that are labeled as \n\"unsaturated\" or \"polyunsaturated.\"   \nAlmond oil, which is used in many cosmetics, is very unsaturated. Chemically, \nthe material that makes these oils very toxic is the polyunsaturated \nfat itself.  These unsaturated oils are found in very high concentrations \nin many seeds, and in the fats of animals that have eaten a diet containing \nthem. The fresh oils, whether cold pressed or consumed as part of the \nliving plant material, are intrinsically toxic, and it is not any special \nindustrial treatment that makes them toxic. Since these oils occur in \nother parts of plants at lower concentration, and in the animals which \neat the plants, it is impossible to eat a diet which lacks them, unless \nspecial foods are prepared in the laboratory. These toxic oils are sometimes \ncalled the \"essential fatty acids\" or \"vitamin F,\" \nbut this concept of the oils as essential nutrients was clearly disproved \nover 50 years ago. Linoleic \nand linolenic acids, the \"essential fatty acids,\" and other \npolyunsaturated fatty acids, which are now fed to pigs to fatten them, \nin the form of corn and soy beans, cause the animals' fat to be chemically \nequivalent to vegetable oil.  In the late 1940s, chemical toxins \nwere used to suppress the thyroid function of pigs, to make them get \nfatter while consuming less food.  When that was found to be carcinogenic, \nit was then found that corn and soy beans had the same antithyroid effect, \ncausing the animals to be fattened at low cost.  The animals' fat \nbecomes chemically similar to the fats in their food, causing it to \nbe equally toxic, and equally fattening. These \noils are derived from seeds, but their abundance in some meat has led \nto a lot of confusion about \"animal fats.\"  Many researchers \nstill refer to lard as a \"saturated fat,\" but this is simply \nincorrect when pigs are fed soybeans and corn. Q:  How are these oils hazardous \nto your health? Ultimately, \nall systems of the body are harmed by an excess of these oils.  \nThere are two reasons for this.  One is that the plants produce \nthe oils for protection, not only to store energy for the germination \nof the seed.  To defend the seeds from the animals that would eat \nthem, the oils block the digestive enzymes in the animals' stomachs.  \nDigestion is one of our most basic functions, and evolution has built \nmany other systems by using variations of that system; as a result, \nall of these systems are damaged by the substances which damage the \ndigestive system. The \nother reason is that the seeds are designed to germinate in early spring, \nso their energy stores must be accessible when the temperatures are \ncool, and they normally don't have to remain viable through the hot \nsummer months.  Unsaturated oils are liquid when they are cold, \nand this is necessary for any organism that lives at low temperatures.  \nFor example, fish in cold water would be stiff if they contained saturated \nfats.  These oils easily get rancid (spontaneously oxidizing) when \nthey are warm and exposed to oxygen.  Seeds contain a small amount \nof vitamin E to delay rancidity.  When the oils are stored in our \ntissues, they are much warmer, and more directly exposed to oxygen, \nthan they would be in the seeds, and so their tendency to oxidize is \nvery great.  These oxidative processes can damage enzymes and other \nparts of cells, and especially their ability to produce energy. The \nenzymes which break down proteins are inhibited by unsaturated fats, \nand these enzymes are needed not only for digestion, but also for production \nof thyroid hormones, clot removal, immunity, and the general adaptability \nof cells.  The risks of abnormal blood clotting, inflammation, \nimmune deficiency, shock, aging, obesity, and cancer are increased.  \nThyroid and progesterone are decreased.  Since the unsaturated \noils block protein digestion in the stomach, we can be malnourished \neven while \"eating well.\" Plants \nproduce many protective substances to repel or injure insects and other \nanimals that eat them.  They produce their own pesticides.  \nThe oils in seeds have this function.  On top of this natural toxicity, \nthe plants are sprayed with industrial pesticides, which can concentrate \nin the seed oils. It \nisn't the quantity of these polyunsaturated oils which governs the harm \nthey do, but the relationship between them and the saturated fats.  \nObesity, free radical production, the formation of age pigment, blood \nclotting, inflammation, immunity, and energy production are all responsive \nto the ratio of unsaturated fats to saturated fats, and the higher this \nratio is, the greater the probability of harm there is. There \nare interesting interactions between these oils and estrogen.  \nFor example, puberty occurs at an earlier age if estrogen is high, or \nif these oils are more abundant in the diet.  This is probably \na factor in the development of cancer. All \nsystems of the body are harmed by an excess of these oils.  There \nare three main kinds of damage: one, hormonal imbalances, two, damage \nto the  immune system, and three, oxidative damage. Q: How do they cause hormonal \nimbalances? There \nare many changes in hormones caused by unsaturated fats.  Their \nbest understood effect is their interference with the function of the \nthyroid gland.  Unsaturated oils block thyroid hormone secretion, \nits movement in the circulatory system, and the response of tissues \nto the hormone.  When the thyroid hormone is deficient, the body \nis generally exposed to increased levels of estrogen.  The thyroid \nhormone is essential for making the \"protective hormones\" \nprogesterone and pregnenolone, so these hormones are lowered when anything \ninterferes with the function of the thyroid.  The thyroid hormone \nis required for using and eliminating cholesterol, so cholesterol is \nlikely to be raised by anything which blocks the thyroid function.  \n[B. Barnes and L. Galton, Hypothyroidism, 1976, and 1994 references.] Q: How do they damage the immune \nsystem? Vegetable \noil is recognized as a drug for knocking out the immune system.  \nVegetable oil emulsions were used to nourish cancer patients, but it \nwas discovered that the unsaturated oils were suppressing their immune \nsystems.  The same products, in which vegetable oil is emulsified \nwith water for intravenous injection, are now marketed specifically \nfor the purpose of suppressing immunity in patients who have had organ \ntransplants.  Using the oils in foods has the same harmful effect \non the immune system. [E. A. Mascioli, et al.,Lipids 22(6) 421, 1987.]  \nUnsaturated fats directly kill white blood cells. [C. J. Meade and J. \nMartin, Adv. Lipid Res., 127, 1978.] Q: How do they cause oxidative \ndamage? Unsaturated \noils get rancid when exposed to air; that is called oxidation, and it \nis the same process that occurs when oil paint \"dries.\"  \nFree radicals are produced in the process. This \nprocess is accelerated at higher temperatures.  The free radicals \nproduced in this process react with parts of cells, such as molecules \nof DNA and protein and may become attached to those molecules, causing \nabnormalities of structure and function. Q: What if I eat only organically \ngrown vegetable oils? Even \nwithout the addition of agricultural chemicals, an excess of unsaturated \nvegetable oils damages the human body.  Cancer can't occur, unless \nthere are unsaturated oils in the diet.  [C. Ip, et al., Cancer \nRes. 45, 1985.] Alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver cannot occur unless \nthere are unsaturated oils in the diet.  [Nanji and French, Life \nSciences. 44, 1989.]  Heart disease can be produced by unsaturated \noils, and prevented by adding saturated oils to the diet.  [J. \nK. G. Kramer, et al., Lipids 17, 372, 1983.] Q.  What oils are safe? Coconut \nand olive oil are the only vegetable oils that are really safe, but \nbutter and lamb fat, which are highly saturated, are generally very \nsafe (except when the animals have been poisoned).  Coconut oil \nis unique in its ability to prevent weight-gain or cure obesity, by \nstimulating metabolism.  It is quickly metabolized, and functions \nin some ways as an antioxidant.  Olive oil, though it is somewhat \nfattening, is less fattening than corn or soy oil, and contains an antioxidant which makes it protective \nagainst heart disease and cancer. Israel \nhad the world's highest incidence of breast cancer when they allowed \nthe insecticide lindane to be used in dairies, and the cancer rate decreased \nimmediately after the government prohibited its use.  The United \nStates has fairly good laws to control the use of cancer-causing agents \nin the food supply, but they are not vigorously enforced.  Certain \ncancers are several times more common among corn farmers than among \nother farmers, presumably because corn \"requires\" the use \nof more pesticides.  This probably makes corn oil's toxicity greater \nthan it would be otherwise, but even the pure, organically grown material \nis toxic, because of its intrinsic unsaturation. In \nthe United States, lard is toxic because the pigs are fed large quantities \nof corn and soy beans.  Besides the intrinsic toxicity of the seed \noils, they are contaminated with agricultural chemicals.  Corn \nfarmers have a very high incidence of cancer, presumably because of \nthe pesticides they use on their crop. Q: But aren't \"tropical oils\" \nbad for us? In \ngeneral, tropical oils are much more healthful than oils produced in \na cold climate.  This is because tropical plants live at a temperature \nthat is close to our natural body temperature.  Tropical oils are \nstable at high temperatures.  When we eat tropical oils, they don't \nget rancid in our tissues as the cold-climate seed oils, such as corn \noil, safflower oil and soy oil, do.  [R.B. Wolf, J. Am. Oil Chem. \nSoc. 59, 230, 1982; R. Wolfe, Chem 121, Univ. of Oregon, 1986.] When \nadded to a balanced diet, coconut oil slightly lowers the cholesterol \nlevel, which is exactly what is expected when a dietary change raises \nthyroid function.  This same increase in thyroid function and metabolic \nrate explains why people and animals that regularly eat coconut oil \nare lean, and remarkably free of heart disease and cancer. Although \nI don't recommend \"palm oil\" as a food, because I think it \nis less stable than coconut oil, some studies show that it contains \nvaluable nutrients.  For example, it contains antioxidants similar \nto vitamin E, which lowers both LDL cholesterol and a platelet clotting \nfactor. [B. A. Bradlow, University of Illinois, Chicago; Science News \n139, 268, 1991.]  Coconut oil and other tropical oils also contain \nsome hormones that are related to pregnenolone or progesterone. Q: Isn't coconut oil fattening? Coconut \noil is the least fattening of all the oils.  Pig farmers tried \nto use it to fatten their animals, but when it was added to the animal \nfeed, coconut oil made the pigs lean [See Encycl. Brit. Book of the \nYear, 1946]. Q: What about olive oil?  \nIsn't it more fattening than other vegetable oils? In \nthis case, as with coconut oil, \"fattening\" has more to do \nwith your ability to burn calories than with the caloric value of the \noil.  Olive oil has a few more calories per quart than corn or \nsoy oil, but since it doesn't damage our ability to burn calories as \nmuch as the unsaturated oils do, it is less fattening.   Extra \nvirgin olive oil is the best grade, and contains an antioxidant that \nprotects against cancer and heart disease.  [1994, Curr. Conts.] Q:  Is \"light\" \nolive oil okay? No. \nNow and then someone learns how to make a profit from waste material.  \n\"Knotty pine\" boards were changed from a discarded material \nto a valued decorative material by a little marketing skill.  Light \nolive oil is a low grade material which sometimes has a rancid smell \nand probably shouldn't be used as food. Q:  Is margarine okay? There \nare several problems with margarine.  The manufacturing process \nintroduces some toxins, including a unique type of fat which has been \nassociated with heart disease. [Sci. News, 1974; 1991.] There are likely \nto be dyes and preservatives added to margarine.  And newer products \ncontain new chemicals that haven't been in use long enough to know whether \nthey are safe. However, \nthe basic hardening process, hydrogenation of the oils, has been found \nto make the oils less likely to cause cancer.  If I had to choose \nbetween eating ordinary corn oil or corn oil that was 100% saturated, \nto make a hard margarine, I would choose the hard margarine, because \nit resists oxidation, isn't suppressive to the thyroid gland, and doesn't \ncause cancer. Q:  What about butter? Butter \ncontains natural vitamin A and D and some beneficial natural hormones.  \nIt is less fattening than the unsaturated oils.  There is much \nless cholesterol in an ounce of butter than in a lean chicken breast \n[about 1/5 as much cholesterol in fat as in lean meat on a calorie basis, \naccording to R. Reiser of Texas A & M Univ., 1979.]. Q:  Are fish oils good for \nyou? Some \nof the unsaturated fats in fish are definitely less toxic than those \nin corn oil or soy oil, but that doesn't mean they are safe.  Fifty \nyears ago, it was found that a large amount of cod liver oil in dogs' \ndiet increased their death rate from cancer by 20 times, from the usual \n5% to 100%.  A diet rich in fish oil causes intense production \nof toxic lipid peroxides, and has been observed to reduce a man's sperm \ncount to zero.  [H. Sinclair, Prog. Lipid Res. 25, 667, 1989.] Q: What about lard? In \nthis country, lard is toxic beause the pigs are fed large quantities \nof corn and soy beans.  Besides the natural toxicity of the seed \noils, the oils are contaminated with agricultural chemicals.  Corn \nfarmers have a very high incidence of cancer, presumably because corn \n\"requires\" the use of more pesticides.  This probably \nmakes corn oil's toxicity greater than it would be otherwise. but even \nthe pure, organically grown material is toxic, because of its unsaturation.  Women \nwith breast cancer have very high levels of agricultural pesticides \nin their breasts [See Science News, 1992, 1994]. Israel \nhad the world's highest incidence of breast cancer when they allowed \nthe insecticide lindane to be used in dairies, and the cancer rate decreased \nimmediately after the government prohibited its use.  The United \nStates has fairly good laws to control the use of cancer-causing agents \nin the food supply, but they are not vigorously enforced.  [World \nIncid. of Cancer, 1992] Q:  I have no control over \noils when eating out.  What can I do to offset the harmful effects \nof polyunsaturated oils? A \nsmall amount of these oils won't kill you.  It is the proportion \nof them in your diet that matters.  A little extra vitamin E (such \nas 100 units per day) will take care of an occasional American restaurant \nmeal.  Based on animal studies, it would take a teaspoonful per \nday of corn or soy oil added to a fat-free diet to significantly increase \nour risk of cancer.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to devise \na fat-free diet outside of a laboratory.  Vegetables, grains, nuts, \nfish and meats all naturally contain large amounts of these oils, and \nthe extra oil used in cooking becomes a more serious problem. Q Why are the unsaturated oils \nso popular if they are dangerous? It's \na whole system of promotion, advertising, and profitability. 50 \nyears ago, paints and varnishes were made of soy oil, safflower oil, \nand linseed (flax seed) oil.  Then chemists learned how to make \npaint from petroleum, which was much cheaper.  As a result, the \nhuge seed oil industry found its crop increasingly hard to sell.  \nAround the same time, farmers were experimenting with poisons to make \ntheir pigs get fatter with less food, and they discovered that corn \nand soy beans served the purpose, in a legal way.  The crops that \nhad been grown for the paint industry came to be used for animal food.  \nThen these foods that made animals get fat cheaply came to be promoted \nas foods for humans, but they had to direct attention away from the \nfact that they are very fattening.  The \"cholesterol\" \nfocus was just one of the marketing tools used by the oil industry.  \nUnfortunately it is the one that has lasted the longest, even after \nthe unsaturated oils were proven to cause heart disease as well as cancer.  \n[Study at L.A. Veterans Hospital, 1971.] I use some of these oils (walnut \noil is very nice, but safflower oil is cheaper) for oil painting, but \nI am careful to wash my hands thoroughly after I touch them, because \nthey can be absorbed through the skin. SUMMARY Unsaturated \nfats cause aging, clotting, inflammation, cancer, and weight gain. Avoid \nfoods which contain the polyunsaturated oils, such as corn, soy, safflower, \nflax, cottonseed, canola, peanut, and sesame oil. Mayonnaise, \npastries, even candies may contain these oils; check the labels for \ningredients. Pork \nis now fed corn and soy beans, so lard is usually as toxic as those \noils; use only lean pork. Fish \noils are usually highly unsaturated; \"dry\" types of fish, \nand shellfish, used once or twice a week, are good.  Avoid cod \nliver oil. Use \nvitamin E. Use \ncoconut oil, butter, and olive oil. Unsaturated \nfats intensify estrogen's harmful effects. REFERENCES 1. C. F. Aylsworth, C. W. Welsch, \nJ. J. Kabora, J. E.

Essential Fatty Acids (\"EFA\"):  \nA Technical Point Those \nfatty acids, such as linoleic acid and linolenic acid, which are found \nin linseed oil, soy oil, walnut oil, almond oil, corn oil, etc., are \nessential for the spontaneous development of cancer, and also appear \nto be decisive factors in the development of age pigment, alcoholic \ncirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, obesity, stress-induced immunodeficiency, \nsome aspects of the shock reaction, epilepsy, brain swelling, congenital \nretardation, hardening of the arteries, cataracts, and other degenerative \nconditions.  They are possibly the most important toxin for animals. The \nsuppression of an enzyme system is characteristic of toxins.  The \n\"EFA\" powerfully, almost absolutely, inhibit the enzyme systems--desaturases \nand elongases--which make our native unsaturated fatty acids. After \nweaning, these native fats gradually disappear from the tissues and \nare replaced by the EFA and their derivatives.  The age-related \ndecline in our ability to use oxygen and to produce energy corresponds \nclosely to the substitution of linoleic acid for the endogenous fats, \nin cardiolipin, which regulates the crucial respiratory enzyme, cytochrome \noxidase. Although \nthe fish oils are less effective inhibitors of the enzymes, they are \ngenerally similar to the seed oils in their ability to promote cancer, \nage-pigment formation, free radical damage, etc.  Their only special \nnutritional value seems to be their vitamin A and vitamin D content.  \nSince vitamin A is important in the development of the eye, it is interesting \nthat claims are being made for the essentiality of some of the fatty \nacid components of fish oil, in relation to the development of the eye. The \npolyunsaturated oils from seeds are recommended for use in paints and \nvarnishes, but skin contact with these substances should be avoided. © Ray Peat 2006.

        "chunk_html": "Vegetables, etc.Who Defines Food?Since bacteria in the rumens \nof cows destroy unsaturated fatty acids, but don't harm vitamin E, it \nseems reasonable to suppose that beef and milk would have a better ratio \nof vitamin E to unsaturated fats than do the plants eaten by the cows. Toxic pesticides \nare found in higher concentrations in the urine and fat of slaughtered \nanimals than in their livers, since the livers are detoxifying the chemicals \nand causing them to be excreted. Presumably, the animals' livers will \nperform the same detoxification reactions with thephytotoxicants \nthat occur naturally in their diet. Not \nlong ago, breast feeding was socially unacceptable in the United States, \nand several manufacturers were teaching the worlds poorest women \nto use their baby-food formulas even when there was no clean water for \nits preparation. Industrialists have campaigned to convince the public \nthat their by-products, from cotton-seed oil to shrimp shells, are health \nfoods. In several parts of the world, desperately poor people sometimes \neat clay, and even clay has been promoted as a health food. Almost anything \nbecomes food, when people are under economic and social pressure. \nIf these things arent acutely toxic, they can become part of our \nnormal diet. Our \ninstincts give us a few clues about our nutritional needs, such as thirst, \nthe hunger for salt, the pleasantness of sweet things, and the unpleasantness \nof certain odors or very acrid or bitter tastes. People who are constitutionally \nunable to taste certain bitter chemicals find certain vegetables less \nobjectionable; their instinctive guidance has become less clear.  \nBut within the boundaries of cravings and disgust, habits and customs \nbecome the dominant forces in diet. \"Professional dietitians\" \nand other \"experts\" primarily function as enforcers of cultural \nprejudice. The \nmanufacturers of pureed vegetables for babies used to put large amounts \nof salt, sugar, and monosodium glutamate into their products, because \nthe added chemicals served as instinctual signals that made the material \nsomewhat acceptable to the babies. There was no scientific basis for \nproviding these vegetables to babies in a form that they would accept, \nbut it was a profitable practice that was compatible with the social \npressure against prolonged breast feeding. Poor \npeople, especially in the spring when other foods were scarce, have \nsometimes subsisted on foliage such as collard and poke greens, usually \nmade more palatable by cooking them with flavorings, such as a little \nbacon grease and lots of salt. Eventually, \"famine foods\" \ncan be accepted as dietary staples. The fact that cows, sheep, goats \nand deer can thrive on a diet of foliage shows that leaves contain essential \nnutrients. Their minerals, vitamins, and amino acids are suitable for \nsustaining most animal life, if a sufficient quantity is eaten. But \nwhen people try to live primarily on foliage, as in famines, they soon \nsuffer from a great variety of diseases. Various leaves contain antimetabolic \nsubstances that prevent the assimilation of the nutrients, and only \nvery specifically adapted digestive systems (or technologies) can overcome \nthose toxic effects. Some \nplants have specific pests, such as insects, that have adapted \nto be resistant to that plants toxins, but if the plant and its predator \nare to survive, there has to be a balance between the plant tissues \ndigestibility and its toxicity. Injury of a plant stimulates it to make \nincreased amounts of its defensive chemicals. Plant toxins are known \nto be specific for animal tissues; for example, a toxin will inhibit \nthe action of an enzyme from an animal, but a plant enzyme that catalyzes \nthe same reaction wont be affected. Plant \ndefensive chemicals can have beneficial uses as drugs. Plants are important \nsources for chemicals used in chemotherapy of cancer, with the purpose \nof stopping cell division. Other plant drugs can stimulate cell division. \nThe drug from one plant will sometimes protect cells against the toxic \neffects of another plant. The use of any drug that isnt a natural \npart of animal physiology will have many biological effects, so that \na beneficial drug action will usually be accompanied by unwanted side-effects. \nAn antioxidant may turn out to disrupt the endocrine system, an antiinflammatory \ndrug may be mutagenic or carcinogenic. A \nparticular plant will have a variety of defensive chemicals, with specific \nfunctions. Underground, the plants roots and tubers are susceptible \nto attack by fungi and nematodes. The leaves, stems, and seeds are susceptible \nto attack by insects, birds, and grazing animals. Since the plants \nseeds are of unique importance to the plant, and contain a high concentration \nof nutrients, they must have special protection. Sometimes this consists \nof a hard shell, and sometimes of chemicals that inhibit the animals \ndigestive enzymes. Many plants have evolved fruits that provide concentrated \nfood for animals, and that serve to distribute the seeds widely, as \nwhen a bird eats a berry, and excretes the undigested seed at a great \ndistance. If the fruit were poisonous, it wouldnt serve the plants \npurpose so well. In general, the plants most intense toxins are in \nits seeds, and the fruits, when mature, generally contain practically \nno toxins. Roots contain chemicals that inhibit microorganisms, but \nbecause they arent easily accessible by grazing animals and insects, \nthey dont contain the digestive inhibitors that are more concentrated \nin the above-ground organs \nof the plant. The \ntoxins of plants include phenols, tannins, lectins/agglutinins, and \ntrypsin-inhibitors, besides innumerable more specific metabolic inhibitors, \nincluding anti-vitamins. Unsaturated fats themselves are important \ndefenses, since they inhibit trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes, \npreventing the assimilation of the proteins that are present in seeds \nand leaves, and disrupting all biological processes that depend on protein \nbreakdown, such as the formation of thyroid hormone and the removal \nof blood clots. Generally, \nfruits, roots, and tubers provide a high concentration of nutrients \nalong with low concentrations of toxic antimetabolic substances. While \nnutritional reference tables often show fruits and potatoes as having \nabout 2% protein content, while nuts, grains, and legumes are shown \nwith a high protein content, often in the range of 15% to 40%, they \nneglect to point out that fruits and potatoes have a very high water \ncontent, while that of the seeds is extremely low. The protein content \nof milk is about 3%, which according to the charts would suggest that \nit is inferior to beans and grains. In fact, the protein value of grain \nis negligible, mainly because seeds contain their protein in a storage \nform, that is extremely rich in nitrogen, but poor in essential amino \nacids. Special preparation is needed to reduce the toxicity of seeds, \nand in the case of beans, these methods are never very satisfactory. Besides \ntheir specific defensive toxins and antimetabolites, plants are major \nsources of allergens. The allergenicity of a food depends on the sensitivity \nof the individual, as well as on the growth conditions of the plant. \nThe use of extremely toxic pesticides has affected both the crops and \nthe sensitivity of the human population to allergens. Sensitivities \ninduced originally by toxic pesticides used on certain crops can probably \npersist after the industrial chemical has been eliminated, because the \nimmune system is susceptible to conditioning. Many \ntypes of phytochemicals are mutagenic, and some of those are carcinogenic. \nBruce Ames, at the University of California, devised a method of screening \nfor mutagens, using bacteria. One of his graduate students using the \ntechnique found that the flame retardants in children's pajamas and \nbedding were powerful mutagens, and were probably causing cancer. That \nevent made Ames a celebrity, and in the 1980s he went on a lecture tour \nsupported by the American Cancer Society. His lectures reflected the \ndoctrine of the A.C.S., that industrial chemicals aren't responsible \nfor cancer, but that individual actions, such as smoking or dietary \nchoices, are the main causes of cancer. He used a fraudulently \"age \nadjusted\" graph of cancer mortality, that falsely showed that mortality \nfrom all types of cancer except lung cancer had leveled off after the \nA.C.S. came into existence. He described tests in which he had compared \nDDT to extracts of food herbs, and found DDT to be less mutagenic than \nseveral of the most commonly used flavoring herbs. His message, which \nwas eagerly received by his audience of chemistry and biology professors, \nwas that we should not worry about environmental pollution, because \nit's not as harmful as the things that we do to ourselves. He said that \nif everyone would eat more unsaturated vegetable oil, and didn't smoke, \nthey wouldn't have anything to worry about. For \nme, the significance of his experiment was that plants contain natural \npesticides that should be taken more seriously, without taking industrial \ntoxins less seriously. Technologies \nhave been invented to convert vegetation into digestible protein, but \nat our present scientific and technological level, its better to \nsimply minimize our use of the more toxic foods, and to direct more \neffort toward the elimination of the conditions that produce famine. Animal \nproteins, and fruits, because they contain the lowest levels of toxins, \nshould form the basis of the diet. Not all fruits, of course, are perfectly \nsafe--avocados, for example, contain so much unsaturated fat that they \ncan be carcinogenic and hepatotoxic. Protein \ndeficiency itself contributes to the harm done by toxins, since the \nlivers ability to detoxify them depends on adequate nutrition, especially \ngood protein. In the 1940s, Biskinds experiments showed that protein \ndeficiency leads to the accumulation of estrogen, because the liver \nnormally inactivates all the estrogen in the blood as it passes through \nthe liver. This applies to phytoestrogens and industrial estrogens as \nwell as to the natural estrogens of the body. At a certain point, the \nincreased estrogen and decreased thyroid and progesterone cause infertility, \nbut before that point is reached, the hyperestrogenism causes a great \nvariety of birth defects. Deformities of the male genitals, and later, \ntesticular cancer in the sons and breast cancer in the daughters, are \nproduced by the combination of toxins and nutritional deficiencies.

        "chunk_html": "Vitamin E: Estrogen antagonist, energy promoter, and anti-inflammatoryVitamin \nE, like progesterone and aspirin, acts within the cellular regulatory \nsystems, to prevent inflammation and inappropriate excitation. Since \nuncontrolled excitation causes destructive \noxidations, these substances prevent those forms of oxidation. Molecules \nthat can easily be oxidized and reduced can function as antioxidants, \nand vitamin E does function as that kind of antioxidant in many chemical \nenvironments. But it is highly misleading to consider that as the explanation \nfor its many beneficial biological effects. That kind of reasoning contributed \nto the use of the antioxidant carcinogens \nBHT and BHA as food additives and \"antiaging\" supplements, \nand many other chemicals are being promoted on the basis of their abstract \nantioxidant function. Becoming \naware of the real value of vitamin E will have far reaching implications \nin nutrition and medicine. In determining \ncriminal or civil legal responsibility, the concept \"should have \nknown\" is recognized and used. In science, which is all about knowing, \nthere is certainly a responsibility to be informed when the subject \ninvolves the life and health of millions of people. The science establishment \nof government and industry should be held responsible for the information \nit hides, destroys, or ignores for its own benefit. The US government \nhas an agency for prosecuting research fraud, but the concept is applied \nso narrowly as to be meaningless, when deception has become the rule. \nAnd since it controls the court system, \ngovenment agencies and their functionaries won't be prosecuted, even \nwhen their crimes become well known. \"Vitamin \nE was advocated as an effective treatment for heart disease by Dr. Evan \nShute of London, Ontario more than 50 years ago.His pioneering claims, which were unacceptable to the medical \ncommunity at large, have been confirmed by recent findings from \nepidemiologic studies and clinical trials.\" Political \nscientists have recognized the process in which big corporations \"capture\" \n\nthe governmental agencies that were created to regulate them. The editorial \nboards of professional journals can be captured even more cheaply than \nthe agencies of government, and their influence can be even more valuable \nto industry. If \nscience impinges upon the plans of an industry, it can be managed into \ncompliance, when the industry controls the journals and the agencies \nthat fund research. In \nthe 1940s, it had already become clear to the estrogen industry that \nvitamin E research was impinging on its vital interests. The \nManhattan Project, that created the atomic bomb, also created a generation \nof scientific and bureaucratic zealots who ignored public health and \nsafety to advance their projects and their careers, and changed the \nway science was done. At exactly the same time, the pharmaceutical industry \nwas using its financial and political power to change the way medicine \nwas practiced and taught, and the consequences for world health rivalled \nthose of the nuclear industry. In \n1933 the physician R.J. Shute was aware of the problems associated with \ntoxemia of pregnancy or preeclampsia. Especially among poorly nourished \nwomen, many pregnancies were complicated by circulatory problems, including \ncyclic bleeding, thrombosis, stroke, and hypertension, and these difficult \npregnancies often ended in miscarriage or premature delivery, resulting \nin many serious health problems among the babies that survived. At \nthat time, both estrogen and vitamin E were being widely studied, though \nthe exact structure of the tocopherol molecule wasn't defined until \n1936-37. Vitamin E had been found to improve fertility of both male \nand female animals, and to prevent intrauterine death of the embryo \nor fetus, so it was called the \"antisterility vitamin.\" Using \nit to prevent women from having miscarriages must have occurred to many \npeople. Animal \nresearch in the 1930s was also showing that estrogen had many toxic \neffects, including causing infertility or intrauterine death, connective \ntissue abnormalities, and excessive blood clotting. Dr. Shute and his \nsons, Wilfred and Evan, were among those who considered vitamin E to \nbe an antiestrogen. They found that it was very effective in preventing \nthe clotting diseases of pregnancy. Other \nresearchers, who knew that progesterone protected against the toxic \neffects of estrogen, described vitamin E as the \"progesterone-sparing \nagent,\" since so many of its antiestrogenic effects resembled those \nof progesterone. The \nShute brothers began using vitamin E to treat circulatory diseases in \ngeneral, rather than just in pregnant women--blood clots, phlebitis, \nhypertension, heart disease, and diabetes all responded well to treatment \nwith large doses. Vitamin \nE, as its name indicates, was the fifth type of \"vitamin\" \nfactor to be identified, and it received its name in 1922, even though \nits chemical structure hadn't been identified. The public quickly understood \nand accepted that certain substances in food were essential for life \nand health, so by 1940 practically all physicians were recommending \nthe use of nutritional supplements. If \nvitamin E was essential for human health, and achieved at least some \nof its amazing effects by opposing estrogen, then the synthetic estrogen \nindustry had a problem. Edward \nL. Bernays had already been in business for decades, teaching corporations \nand governments how to \"engineer consent.\" After his work \nfor the government to engineer support for entering the first world \nwar, Bernays' next big job was for the tobacco industry. To convince \nwomen to smoke cigarettes, to achieve equality with men, he organized \nan Easter parade, Torches of Freedom, in which thousands of women marched \nsmoking their freedom torches. In association with the American Medical \nAssociation (the editor of JAMA actually helped the tobacco industry \ndesign its campaigns), Bernays ran a campaign to convince Americans \nthat smoking was good for the health. The \ndrug industry began using his techniques in sometimes crude but always \neffective ways. Estrogen was named \"the female hormone;\" natural \nhormones, including estrogen and progesterone, were claimed, without \nany research, to be inactive when taken orally. Physician-shills were \ncreated to claim wonderful effects for estrogen. The vitamin status \nof the tocopherols was denied; as recently as the 1970s (and maybe later), \nuniversity professors of dietetics were flatly saying \"no one needs \nvitamin E.\" Very \nlittle research showing the curative effects of vitamin E in human diseases \nwas allowed to be published, so it was only occasionally necessary to \nopenly denounce vitamin E as worthless or dangerous. In 1981, the journal \nof the AMA published an article reviewing the \"toxic\" effects \nof vitamin E. Since I had read all of the articles cited, I realized \nthat the author was claiming that whenever vitamin E changed something, \nthe change was harmful, even though the original publication had described \nthe effect as beneficial. Although \nJAMA was eventually forced to give up its revenue from cigarette advertising, \nit didn't suffer at all, because of the vast advertising campaigns of \nthe estrogen industry. JAMA obviously wouldn't want to publish anything \nsuggesting that vitamin E, or progesterone, or thyroid, might be beneficial \nbecause of its antagonism of the harmful effects of estrogen. Estrogen \ncauses changes in the uterus that prevent implantation of the embryo, \nand that impair support for its development if it has already implanted. \nIt decreases the availability of oxygen to the embryo, while vitamin \nE increases it. My \ndissertation adviser, A.L. Soderwall, did a series of experiments in \nwhich he showed that providing hamsters with extra vitamin E postponed \nthe onset of infertility in middle age. In my experiments, vitamin E \nincreased the amount of oxygen in the uterus, correcting an oxygen deficiency \nproduced either by supplemental estrogen or by old age. Progesterone \nhas similar effects on the delivery of oxygen to the uterus. In \nthe 1940s, the official definition of vitamin E's activity was changed. \nInstead of its effectiveness in preventing the death and resorption of embryos, or the degeneration of \nthe testicles or brain or muscles, it was redefined as an antioxidant, \npreventing the oxidation of unsaturated oils. Although \nsome people continued to think of it as a protective factor against \nthrombosis, heart attacks, diabetes, and infertility, the medical establishment \nclaimed that the prevention or cure of diseases in animals wasn't relevant \nto humans, and that a mere antioxidant couldn't prevent or cure any \nhuman disease. The \nexperiments that led to the identification of vitamin E involved feeding \nrats a diet containing rancid lard and, as a vitamin A supplement, cod \nliver oil. Both of these contained large amounts of polyunsaturated \noils. From \n1929 to the early 1930s, other researchers were claiming to have demonstrated \nthat the polyunsaturated fatty acids were nutritionally essential. These \nexperiments, like the vitamin E experiments, were done on rats, but \nthe medical establishment was satisfied that rat experiments proved \nthat humans need linoleic or linolenic acid, while they refused to accept \nthat vitamin E was essential for humans. When, in the 1940s, a group \nof vitamin B6 researchers showed that the supposed \"essential fatty \nacid deficiency\" could be cured by a supplement of vitamin B6, \nit became apparent that the polyunsaturated fatty acids slowed metabolism, \nand reduced all nutritional needs. The thyroid hormone was powerfully \nsuppressed by the \"essential\" fatty acids. When \nwe consider the two sets of experiments together, their outstanding \nfeature is the toxicity of the polyunsaturated oils, which in one kind \nof experiment suppressed metabolism, and in the other kind of experiment \ncreated a variety of degenerative conditions. By \nthe late 1940s and early 1950s, estrogens of various sorts had been \nsynthesized from hydrocarbons, and were being recommended to prevent \nmiscarriages, because \"estrogen is the female hormone.\" The \nmeat industry had found that the polyunsaturated oils were valuable \nin animal feed, since they suppressed metabolism and made it cheaper \nto fatten the animals, and these antithyroid oils were next marketed \nas \"heart protective\" human foods, though by suppressing the \nthyroid and destroying vitamin E, they actually contributed to both \nheart disease and cancer. (Giving estrogen to livestock to improve their \nfeed efficiency, and to people \"to prevent heart attacks,\" \nwas an interesting parallel to the oil promotional campaigns.) The \ninfluence of the food oil industry kept researchers away from the idea \nthat these oils were not safe for food use, and instead tended to support \nthe idea that vitamin E is just an antioxidant, and that the seed oils \nwere the best way to get vitamin E in the diet. The \nantifertility effects of the polyunsaturated oils, demonstrated in the \nvitamin E experiments, weren't at the time understood to have anything \nto do with estrogen's antifertility effects. But to understand vitamin \nE, I think we have to consider the close interactions between estrogen \nand the polyunsatured fatty acids (PUFA). Their actions are closely \nintertwined, and are antagonized by a variety of energizing and stabiliizing \nsubstances, including saturated fats, progesterone, thyroid, vitamin \nE, and aspirin. Generally, \nchemicals that inhibit enzymes are toxic, producing some sort of symptom \nor deterioration. But a group of enzymes related to estrogen and PUFA \nare inhibited by these protective substances. Although under our present \ndiet, these enzymes metabolize the PUFA, \nin the fetus and newborn they act on our endogenous fats, the series \nrelated to the Mead acids. The Mead acid is antiinflammatory, and broadly \nprotective. The dietary PUFA interfere with these natural protective \nsubstances, The \nenzymes that, if we didnt eat PUFA, would be regulating the Mead \nseries, being activated in response to stress, would be producing antistress \nsubstances, which would limit the stress reaction. But as we become \nincreasingly saturated with the anti-vitamin E fats, these enzymes, \ninstead of stopping inflammation, promote it and cause tissue injury. \nThe remaining stress limiting factors, such as progesterone, by correcting \nthe distortions caused by stress, tend to eliminate the conditions which \nactivated the enzymes--in a very indirect form of inhibition. Many \nof the events involved in inflammation are increased by estrogen, and \ndecreased by vitamin E. Estrogen causes capillaries to become leaky; \nvitamin E does the opposite. Estrogen increases platelet aggregation, \nand decreases a factor that inhibits platelet aggregation; vitamin E \ndoes the opposite. Excess \nclotting is known to be caused by too much estrogen, and also by a vitamin \nE deficiency. Clotting \nleads to fibrosis, and there is clear evidence that vitamin E prevents \nand cures fibrotic diseases, but this still isn't generally accepted \nby the powerful medical institutions. Estrogen and polyunsaturated fats \nincrease fibrosis. Estrogen \nincreases progstaglandin synthesis, vitamin E decreases their synthesis; \nestrogen increases the activity of the enzymes COX and LOX, vitamin \nE decreases their activitiy. (Jiang, et al., 2000; Ali, et al., 1980; \nParkhomets, et al., 2001.) Estrogen releases enzymes from lysosomes, \nvitamin E inhibits their release. Beta-glucuronidase, one of these enzymes, \ncan release estrogen at the site of an inflammation. Estrogen \noften increases intracellular calcium and protein kinase C, vitamin \nE has generally opposite effects. The \npolyunsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives, the prostaglandins, \nact as effectors , or amplifiers, \nof estrogen's actions. If \nvitamin E is acting as a protectant against the polyunsaturated fatty \nacids, that in itself would account for at least some of its antiestrogenic \neffects. Besides \nantagonizing some of the end effects of the toxic fatty acids, vitamin \nE inhibits lipolysis, lowering the concentration of free fatty acids \n(the opposite of estrogens effect), and it also binds to, and inactivates, \nfree fatty acids. The long saturated carbon chain is very important \nfor its full functioning, and this saturated chain might allow it to \nserve as a substitute for the omega -9 fats, from which the Mead acid \nis formed. The unsaturated tocotrienols have hardly been tested for \nthe spectrum of true vitamin E activity, and animal studies have suggested \nthat it may be toxic, since it caused liver enlargement. One \npossibly crucial protective effect of vitamin E against the polyunsaturated \nfatty acids that hasn't been explored is the direct destruction of linolenic \nand linoleic acid. It is known thatbacterial vitamin E is involved \nin the saturation of unsaturated fatty acids, and it is also known that \nintestinal bacteria turn linoleic and \nlinolenic acids into the fully saturated \nstearic acid. \"No \nmetabolic function is known for alpha-tocopherolquinol or its \nquinone other than as a cofactor in the \nbiohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids that can be carried out \nby only a few organisms.\" P.E. Hughes and S.B. Tove, 1982. Linoleic \nacid was significantly decreased (P < 0.001) and there was a significant \nrise (P < 0.05) in its hydrogenation product, \nstearic acid. Linolenic acid was also significantly decreased. . . . \nThe study provides evidence that bacteria from the human colon can \nhydrogenate C18 essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. F.A. Howard & C. Henderson, \n1999 Because \nof the way in which the decision to call vitamin E a simple antioxidant \nwas conditioned by the historical setting, there has been a reluctance, \nuntil recently, to give much weight to the pathogenicity of lipid peroxidation \nand free radicals, partly because lipid peroxidation is only a minor \npart of the toxicity of the polyunsaturated oils, and there was little \nsupport for the investigation of the real nature of their toxicity. \nThis environment has even distorted the actual antioxidant value of \nthe various forms of vitamin E. (For example, see Chen, et al., 2002.) The \npeople who say that vitamin E is nothing but an antioxidant sometimes \ntake other antioxidants, with, or instead of, vitamin E. BHT, BHA, and \nmany natural compounds (derived from industrial and agricultural wastes) \nare often said to be \"better than vitamin E\" as antioxidants. \nAnything that can be oxidized and reduced (melatonin, estrogen, tryptophan, \ncarotene, etc.) will function as an antioxidant in some system, but \nin other circumstances, it can be a pro-oxidant. The \npeople who think there is benefit in the abstract \"antioxidant\" \nfunction seem to be thinking in terms of something that will, like a \nubiquitous fire department, put out every little fire as soon as it \nstarts. I think it's more appropriate to think of the biological antioxidant \nsystems as programs for controlling the arsonists before they can set \nthe fires. Since \nthe requirement for vitamin E decreases as the consumption of unsaturated \nfats decreases, the requirement, if any, would be very small if we didn't \neat significant quantities of those fats. In \nthe years since the tocopherols were identified as vitamin E, the material \nsold for research and for use as a nutritional supplement has changed \ndrastically several times, even when it has been given a specific chemical \nidentity, such as mixed tocopherols or d-alpha tocopherol. Variations \nin viscosity and color, caused by changes in the impurities, have undoubtedly \ninfluenced its biological effects, but the ideology about its antioxidant \nvalue has kept researchers from finding out what a particular batch \nof it really is and what it really does. \"We \ncompared the effect of a mixed tocopherol preparation with that of \nalpha-tocopherol alone on superoxide \ndismutase (SOD) activity and iNOS expression in cultured \nmyocytes exposed to H-R.\" \n\"Both tocopherol preparations attenuated cell injury. . . . \nHowever, mixed-tocopherol preparation was much superior to \nalpha-tocopherol in terms of myocyte protection. . . . Lack of \nefficacy of commercial tocopherol preparations in clinical trials may \nreflect absence of gamma- and delta-tocopherols.\" ChenH, Li D, Saldeen T, Romeo F, Mehta \nJL,Biochem Biophys Res Commun  2002 \"Mixed \ntocopherol preparation is superior to \nalpha-tocopherol alone against hypoxia-reoxygenation injury.\" Keeping \nour diet as free as possible of the polyunsaturated fats, to create \nsomething like the \"deficiency\" state that is so protective \n(against cancer, trauma, poison, shock, inflammation, infection, etc.) \nin the animal experiments, seems preferable to trying to saturate ourselves \nwith antioxidants, considering the imperfectly defined nature of the \nvitamin E products, and the known toxicity of many of the other antioxidants \non the market. The \ncarcinogenic properties of the polyunsaturated fats have been known \nfor more than 50 years, as has the principle of extending the life span \nby restricted feeding. More recently several studies have demonstrated \nthat the long lived species contain fewer highly unsaturated fats than \nthe short lived species.Restriction of calories prevents the lipids \nin the brain, heart, and liver from becoming more unsaturated with aging.(Lee, et al., 1999; Laganiere, et al., 1993; Tacconi, et al., 1991; \nR. Patzelt-Wenczler, 1981.) When \ncells are grown in tissue culture without the essential fatty acids, \nthey become deficient, and in that state are very resistant to \nchemical injury, and can be grown indefinitely. Besides being a simple \ndemonstration of the way in which the polyunsaturated fats sensitize \ncells to injury (Wey, et al., 1993), these experiments must be an embarrassment \nto the people who base their argument for the oils essentiality on \na supposed requirement for making cell membranes. Since the cells \ncan multiply nicely in their deficient state, we have to conclude that \nthe oils arent needed for membranes, or maybe that cells resist \ninjury better without membranes. In \nthe opposite direction, an excess of insulin or prolactin, or a deficiency \nof vitamin E, increases the activity of the enzymes that convert linoleic \nacid into the more highly unsaturated fatty acids. Excess insulin and \nprolactin are crucially involved in many degenerative diseases. The \nhighly unsaturated fats suppress respiration in many ways, and these \ntrends toward increased unsaturation with aging, endocrine stress, and \nvitamin E deficiency parallel the life-long trend toward lower energy \nproduction from respiration. Many studies show that vitamin E can protect \nand improve mitochondrial energy production. (Kikuchi, et al., 1991; \nDonchenko, et al., 1990, 1983; Guarnieri, et al., 1981, 1982.) But the \nstate of so-called essential fatty acid deficiency not only makes mitochondria \nvery resistant to injury, it greatly intensifies their energy production. \nVitamin E supplementation is seldom as effective as the absence of the \ntoxic oils. Many \nnutrition charts no longer list liver as a good source of vitamin E, \nbut a large portion of an animals vitamin E is in its liver. This \nbias in the dietetic literature can be traced to various sources, but \na major influence was the campaign in the 1970s by the drug companies \nthat had patented new forms of synthetic vitamin A. They had physicians \nand professors fabricate stories about the great toxicity of natural \nvitamin A, and placed the stories in national magazines, to clear the \nfield for their supposedly non-toxic products, which have turned out \nto be disastrously toxic. The result is that many people have fearfully \nstopped eating liver, because of its vitamin A. The other vitamins in \nliver, including vitamin K, function very closely with vitamin E, and \nthe stably stored forms of vitamin E are likely to be a good approximation \nfor our needs. There \nis still a strong division between what people can say in their professional \npublications, and what they believe. A man who was influential in designating \nvitamin E as an antioxidant, M.K. Horwitt, complained when the government \nraised its recommended vitamin E intake by 50%, because it wasnt \nsupported by new data, and because millions of people get only ten milligrams \nper day and are healthy. But he has been taking 200 mg daily (plus \naspirin) for many years. He apparently doesn't have very much confidence \nin the ideas he advocates publicly.

Little is known about the influence \nof food restriction on brain lipids, whose concentration and composition \nhave been shown to change with age. We studied whether some biochemical \nand biophysical parameters of rat brain membranes, known to be modified \nwith age, were affected by a diet low in calories, in which 50% of lipids \nand 35% of carbohydrates have been replaced by fibers. The diet was \nstarted at weaning and maintained throughout the animal's entire life \nspan. Animals fed the low calorie diet survived longer and gained less \nbody weight than standard diet fed rats. Age-related increases in microviscosity, \ncholesterol/phospholipid and sphingomyelin/phosphatidylcholine ratios \nwerereduced or restored to the levels of young animals in cortex \nmembranes of 32 old rats fed the low calorie diet, while the age-related \nincrease in mono- to polyunsaturated fatty acid ratios in \nphospholipids was further raised.In conclusion we have shown that \na diet low in calories and high in fibers affects lipid composition \nin the rat brain,in a direction opposite to that normally believed \nto reduce age-related deterioration of brain functions.

Exposure of \nEFAD keratinocytes for 2 hr to concentrations of \nt-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) up to 2 \nmM did not result in toxicity assessed by lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH) release and only a small indication of lipid \nperoxidation assessed by the release of \nthiobarbituric acid-reactive substances(TBARS). Addition of 10 \nmicroM linoleic acid (LA) to serum-free medium alleviated the EFAD condition \nby increasing the phospholipid content of LA and its elongation and \ndesaturation products, arachidonic acid and docosatetraenoic acid. Exposure \nof LA-supplemented keratinocytes to tBHP resulted in significant LDH \n(at 1 and 2 mM tBHP) and TBARS (tBHP concentration dependent) release. \nTBARS release was also significantly elevated in unexposed LA-supplemented \nkeratinocytes (basal release). Co-supplementation with the antioxidant,alpha-tocopherol succinate (TS) prevented \ntBHP (1 mM)-induced LDH release in LA-supplemented cultures. TS supplementation \nalso attenuated the effect of tBHP on \nTBARS release, but when compared to TS-supplemented \nEFAD cultures, LAsupplementation still led to increased tBHP-induced \nTBARS release.

William Blake as biological visionary\"As \nthe true method of knowledge is experiment, the true faculty of knowing \nmust be the faculty which experiences.\" \"Seest \nthou the little winged fly, smaller than a grain of sand?  It has \na heart like thee; a brain open to heaven & hell....\" \"Energy \nis the only life, and is from the Body....  Energy is eternal delight.\" \"Then \ntell me, what is the material world, and is it dead?\"  He, laughing. \nanswer'd: \"I will write a book on leaves of flowers, if you will \nfeed me on love thoughts & give me now and then A cup of sparkling \npoetic fancies; so, when I am tipsie, I'll sing to you to this soft \nlute, and shew you all alive The world, where every particle of dust \nbreathes forth its joy.\" (1794) When \nI started studying William Blake in the 1950s, it seemed that only English \nmajors knew who he was, but today, I think more people might recognize \nThe Tyger as Blakes than would be able to identify poems by Keats, \nByron, Shelley, or Wordsworth.  After 200 years, his writing seems \ncontemporary, while other poets works have become dated, and are \nvalued mostly as cultural background.  But I dont think this \nmeans that his work is any easier to understand than it was when he \nwrote it.  It means that other poets tied their writing to frameworks \nwhich have receded into the background, while Blakes words were chosen \nin a way that allowed them to travel across the centuries without loss.  \nEven though such universality is a goal of science as well as of art, \nmost of what passed for science in the 18thcentury is today \nof only historical interest. Everywhere \nin our culture, authoritarian ignorance has disproportionate influence.  \nMost of the published work in our culture treats the succession of authoritarian \nacademic/scien- tific/political cults as if this were simply the way \nhistory and human nature work, and must work.  But this mechanical \nhistorical process is only superficial, and below this surface, individuals \nand groups have always lived as though time behaved very differently \nfor them.  William Blake was a person who investigated this discrepancy \nbetween official cultural progression, and real human possibility, and \nhis ideas might be able to do essentially what he suggested they could \ndo:Provide a way to by-pass the officially established mechanistic \nview of reality, into a more fully human reality.  Since Blake \nridiculed established doctrines in medicine, chemistry, mathematics, \nand Newtonian physics, many people have dismissed him as a religious \nnut, but the way in which he criticized them indicates that he simply \nbelieved that they were bad science;he also criticized conventional \nart and morality, because he believed that they were destroying art \nand morality. A \ngroup that was active in the 1950s, called Synectics, developed several \nmental procedures that they found to be useful in teaching people to \nsolve problems creatively.  These included ways to improve thinking \nby analogy, to get people out of the ruts of conventional thinking.  \nPersonification, fantasy, biological imagery, making the familiar \nstrange, they found, seemed to tap into natural biological and mental \nprocesses to increase the ability to direct energy toward valid solutions \nto practical or artistic problems.  They found that experts had \nto overcome their special knowledge before they could usefully solve \nproblems in their field, and they showed that much of the mystery \ncould be removed from the creative process.  Simply putting aside \ndogmatic mental frameworks was crucial. When \nyou believe that you have adequate, expert knowledge, a passive, logical, \ndeductive form of mental activity seems appropriate.  Deduction \nalways goes from a higher level of generality to a lower level of generality.  \nMental passivity therefore is likely to be associated with the belief \nthat we have the decisive knowledge already stored in memory.  \nIf we believe that wecreatehigher degrees of generality, as \nappropriate solutions to novel problems, then we are committed to an \nactive mental life.  Perception, combined with the discovery and \ninvention of new patterns in the world, will be actively oriented toward \nthe future, while the deductive, merely analytical, manner of thought \nwill be tied to the past. Blakes \nwork, I think, is of continued and increased interest because he discovered \nsomething of great importance, namely, how to avoid dogmatisms of all \nsorts.  Many students who are assigned to write about a poem of \nBlakes are puzzled, and ask what it means.  When they find out \nthat they understand the words and the syntax, it turns out that the \nonly problem was that they were taught that they had to interpret \npoetry.  And that they dont think he could have meant what he \nsaid.  Most twentieth century students are too stodgy to accept \nBlakes writing easily.  In the 1950s, some people couldnt \nunderstand Alan Ginsbergs poetry, because they didnt think anyone \nwas allowed to say such things.  That is the kind of problem students \nhave with Blake. But \nits not just high school and college students who cant believe \nthat Blake meant what he said.  I recently reviewed the comments \non The Tyger that have been published in the forty years since I wrote \nmy MA thesis on Blake, and it seems that these academic experts are \nhaving the same kind of problem.  Dostoyevsky wrote about this \nproblem in The Doubleit is the problem of self-assertion, of seeing \noneself reflected everywhere in the world.  In Dostoyevskys \nstory, Dream of an Odd Fellow, the theme is stated even more clearlythe \nworld is very boring, andeverything seems the same as everything \nelse,until you can escape from a certain interpretive framework, \nto see what is really present to you.  In Blakes phrase, if \nthe many become the same as the few when possessed,more, \nmore, is the cry of a mistaken soul;Blake said, over and \nover, that the many do not become the same as the few, that we are always \nmoving into a new world as we learn more, except when we find ourselves \nin the mental manacles of interpretation. Its \neasy to forget how pervasive philosophical interpretation is in everyday \nlife and in the so-called sciences, and how much the sciences owe to \nlong-standing theological commitments.  Within the last generation, \nmany influential people have said that facts dont matter (and I suspect \nthat their favorable reception has owed everything to that attitude.)   \nIn the early 1960s, there was a controversy going on between two schools \nof thought in linguistics and the philosophy of science, the Katz and \nFodor controversy.  I think Fodor was in the minority at that time, \nat least among the most prestigious professors in the United States.  \nFodor said that if we wanted to know about language, we should find \nout how the language is used, by watching a variety of people using \nit.  His opponents said that, if they were competent to speak the \nlanguage, they didnt need to do anything except to think, to understand \neverything about the language.  Fodor was an empiricist, his opponents \nwere rationalists.  In mathematics, most people are still rationalists.  \nA large school of contemporary thought about computers, called Artificial \nIntelligence, is operating within a                  \nrationalistic framework.  Chomskys generative grammar \nwas ultra-rationalistic, and was easy to set up in computers, though \nit was perfectly useless in itself.  Some physicists hold a philosophy \nof science that is essentially rationalistic.  In Platos time,all knowledgecould supposedly be derived by introspection and the \nanalysis of innate ideas, and education consisted in drawing out \nthe knowledge that was innate.  (Aristotle, who didnt subscribe \nto Platos rationalism, has nevertheless been blamed for holding opinions \nthat werent sufficiently supported by observation.  This was \nprobably because he occasionally relied on the opinions of others, rather \nthan because of any serious defect in his philosophical-scientific method.) Its \nimportant to remember that Rationalism, as used here, isnt simply \na love of reason, which is what is often meant when people speak \nof rationalism.  In its historical use among philosophers, \nrather than being just a devotion to rationality, it is a specific doctrine \nwhich denies that experience is the source of knowledge.  Historically, \nRationalism has been closely allied with mysticism, as an affirmation \nthat knowledge comes from a source beyond the ordinary world of experience \nand beyond the individual. At the present time, it serves authoritarian \nscience rather than authoritarian theology, though the basic doctrine \nis the same. Several \ncontemporary schools of literary theory, sociology, anthropology, even \nbiology, trace their ideas back to Ferdinand de Saussures analysis \nof language, reading into it a highly rationalistic doctrine for which \nthere is no actual basis.  Saussures most important idea was \nthat it is impossible to analyze language into its structural units \nwithout simultaneously seeing its use in relation to the world of meanings.  \nWithout its meanings, it just isnt language.  This is a profoundly \nanti-rationalist insight, since it shows that symbols take their existence \nfrom the experience of communication.  But once the symbols exist, \nthey function by the ways they establish distinctions, this being \ndefined by the ways it has been used in distinction to those, \nthat, etc.  Every time a word is used, its meaning changes \na little, since every use occurs in a new communicative situation.  \nThe contemporary rationalistic academic trends prefer to isolate only \nthe principle of meaning through opposition, since it supports \nthe rationalistic illusion of operating strictly on the symbolic level.  \nThe symbolic level is only an abstraction, and doesnt exist \nindependently. A \nfew decades ago, there was a movement called General Semantics that \ntried to make people more conscious of the way symbols relate to reality.  \nTheir ideas were based on a distinction between the concrete use \nof symbols, and the various levels of abstraction.  These distinctions, \nhowever, made sense only within a certain theory of how language works, \nwhich I think was wrong:It asserted that, if time and space \nwere divided into sufficiently small units, symbols and language could \nbe precise and factual.  It ignored the distinction between reality \nas experienced, and reality as represented in theory.  If you keep \nsubdividing a person, John Smith, into smaller moments, you find that \nthere is nothing that represents the known person.  The person \nthat you are really referring to is actually a summation of many momentsthe \nsummation is the only concreteness.  The person you know \nis a synthesis, and it is that imaginative synthesis of facts to which \nthe concrete symbol refers.  Generality exists in our knowledge \nof the world, and the distinction between concrete and abstract is likely \nto create confusion, and reinforces a specific ideological system.  \nIncidentally, the word concrete derives from the roots grown \nand together, so it is very close in its core meaning to synthesis.  \nA well constructed generalization can be concrete, and a seemingly simple \nterm, such as electron, can be abstract.  (Blake said \nthat a line, no matter how finely divided, was still a line; a line \nexists in our imaginative synthesis of the world, and it is only a denial \nof that synthesis that can divide its unity into infinitesimals.) Mathematics \nhas its value in representing certain relationships or patterns, but \nthe rationalistic illusion that the meaning is independently contained \nand fulfilled by the algorithm, has led many people into dogmatisms \nand serious errors.  Coefficients of reality are often neglected.  \nIn practice, you are not very likely to be mistaken if you assume that \nmathematical descriptions of physical states are always erroneous. In \nthe 17thand 18thcenturies, progress in technology \nand industry was already making rationalism seem inadequate, but it \nstill served the social purpose of allowing the ruling class to claim \nthat the doctrines it wished to enforce had the support of timeless, \ninnate and universal principles.  There was supposed to be a Great \nChain of Being, a hierarchy in which the king and the lords were just \nbelow the angels, and Reason was a mathematically clear description \nof the way things were, and should be.  As the chain of being finally \nbroke up at the end of the 18thcentury, the king brought \nin the Rev. Malthus to explain how war, poverty, and disease served \nthe divine, or kingly, purpose, by controlling population growth, justifying \nmisery and social antagonism in a new way. There \nwere philosophers, such as John Locke and David Hume, who argued that \nmuch of our knowledge is gained through the senses, and there were satirists, \nsuch as Henry Fielding, who ridiculed the supposedly divinely sanctioned \nclass system, but Blake took a much simpler, but more radical position, \nin saying that Reason isnt the same that it will be when we know \nmore, and that reason is only the ratio of things that are presently \nknown, and not the source of new knowledge.  Blake kept the idea \nthat experience is the source of knowledge, without reducing experience \nto the senses.  Blake didnt deny the existence of some \ninnate ideas;he didnt think we were born as a blank slate, \nbut there is more to the mind than what we are born with. Imagination \nand invention and mental striving were able to generate new forms.  \nThis commitment to experience as the source of knowledge, rather than \njust analyzing a stock of innate ideas, made Blakes world one \nthat was oriented toward the future, toward invention and discovery, \nrather than to memory, established knowledge, and tradition.  In \nits essence, it was antidogmatic. Rationalism \nis a system of symbols, in which each symbol is demonstrated to have \nits own proper place and status.  To the extent that reason is \nheld to be innate, the system will be prescriptive and judgmental, \nrather than simply descriptive, explanatory, and illuminating.  \nWhen an alternative system is proposed, it may be considered a heresy, \nif the system from which it dissents is both rationalistic and authoritarian. Except \nfor the dangers involved in committing a heresy, it is very easy to \nfollow the implications of the system that one finds in ones own \nmind, since self-assertion contains no principle of corrective contradiction.  \nEssentially,rationalism consists of thinking something is true because \nyou thought of it. I \nthink of the philosophical Rationalists as being the bureaucrats of \nthe mind, making everything tedious and boring and repetitive.  \nEliminating Rationalism, then actual individualized full mental life \ncan begin. Even \na heresy, if it is based on rationalism, is past-oriented, and dogmatic.  \nOver the years, scholars have ascribed most of the important heresies, \nas well as mainstream religious ideas, to Blake.  Whatever interpretive \nsystem the scholars favor, they are able to find it in Blakes work.  \nCalling Blake a mystic is especially useful when the goal is to \nclaim that the critic is getting at the deepest levels of meaning in \nBlake, even though there is no clear meaning for the word in contemporary \nEnglish, and Blake didnt use the term in a way that suggested he \nwould approve of having the word applied to himself. Blakes \nnotes written in the margins of books make it clear that he wasnt \nsimply adopting anyones doctrinaire opinions, and that he was able \nto find useful ideas in the thoughts of others even when he disagreed \nwith them on important issues.  Blake was not a rationalist, but \nhe agreed with Bishop Berkeleys understanding of the importance of \ndistinguishing thought from language.  He recognized that Descartes, \nLocke, Hume, Newton, had inadequate ideas about the nature of matter, \nbut he didnt accept the simplistic doctrine of extreme rationalism \nthat matter doesnt exist. When \npeople consider Leonardo de Vinci, they usually make the point that \nhe had mastered every field of knowledge, and so the question of sources \nand influences doesnt come up.  In the 18thcentury, London was the cultural center of the world;European, Asian, and ancient cultures and ideas were discussed in books, \nmagazines, and conversations.  Being an engraver, a painter, a \npoet, and a political activist, Blakes circle of acquaintances was \nas wide as anyones could be.  England has had, probably since \nthe 17thcentury or earlier, a counter-culture of opinionated \ndissenters.  I suspect that the people who spent several years \nstudying the classics for a university education were somewhat culturally \ndeprived, relative to the people who participated in the rich unofficial \nculture, where new ideas in art, science, and philosophy were being \ndiscussed.  London was also the center of a world-spanning empire, \na tyrannical class-system, and an industrial-commercial revolution.  \nThe past and the possible futures could be seen from Blakes vantage \npoint. Among \nall the published opinions about things that influenced Blake, I have \nseen only a few discussions of his treatment of scientific ideas, mainly \nhis rejections of Newtons mathematical and physical assumptions, \nand very few comments on Blakes position on the major philosophical \ncontroversies of his time.  A biologist, Jacob Bronowsky, wrote \na book about Blake, but Bronowskys own biological, historical, and \nlinguistic ideas were relatively conventional.  Even though Blakes \nwork is full of images from biology, the critics ignore the fact that \nEmanuel Swedenborg published very advanced biological research in the \nmiddle of the 18thcentury, and that Erasmus Darwin was known \nfor presenting his ideas on biological evolution in poetry (especially \nZoonomia).  The title of Blakes book, The Four Zoas, has apparently \nnever led scholars to ask whether it had anything in common with Zoonomia.  \nEven though Blake made many disparaging remarks about Swedenborgs \nreligious books, many people have claimed that Blake was influenced \nby Swedenborgs religious doctrines, while ignoring the possible influence \nof the scientific work. Although \nthe idea that contradiction produces change is associated with \nHegels Dialectic, it was an old and well known theme in philosophy.  \nWhen Blakes idea, that without Contraries there is no progression, \nis seen in context, I think it is appropriate to think that to a great \nextent, Blake derived the idea from a consideration of the sexes.  \nGeneration, so often discussed in relation to the biblical fall \nof man, always leads to the issue of the productive interaction of \nthe sexual contraries.  The issue of sexual love permeates Blakes \nwork.  I suspect that Blake produced even more explicitly sexual \nwork, but since most of his work wasnt really published, when his \nwife died in 1831, the bulk of his manuscripts and paintings were subject \nto the whims of their unsophisticated owners.  But on the basis \nof his existing work, it is reasonable to say that sexual and imaginative \nenergy was the motor that Blake saw producing intellectual advancement.  \nThis male-female principle of change was more fully explored by Blake \nthan by anyone previously, since he made it concrete and personal, rather \nthan abstract.  Working in history, human energy ran into the constrictive, \nlimiting elements, the tyrannies of policy, philosophy, and commerce.  \nFor Blake, the interaction of energy with those limits became a philosophy \nof freedom and revolution. While \nBlake discussed the importance of perception in understanding the world, \nhe was remarkable in the care he took to make it clear that he saw the \nworld all alive, in which grains of dust or sand, birds, worms, \nants, flies, etc., perceived and experienced in ways that were not different \nfrom those of human life.  Bishop Berkeley, who said that the material \nworld outside the philosophers mind doesnt exist, added as an \nafterthought that it exists in the mind of God.  If consciousness \nis the only guarantee of existence, there was no problem in the existence \nof Blakes world, in which everything was alive and conscious. Everyone \nfinds it almost obligatory to describe The Lamb as a symbol for Jesus, \nbut then they find the Tygers symbolic meaning more problematic, \nandfrom Coleridge in the early 19thcentury down to the \nnewest publications at the end of the 20thcenturypeople \nare boggled by the obscurity of The Fly.  But in that poem, \nBlake makes it clear that there is no obscure symbolism, when he says \nthen am I a happy fly, if I live or if I die, etc.  The animal \npoems are expressions of Blakes evolutionary, vitalistic, cosmology.  \nThe tyger, at least, would be too much for a creationist doctrine to \nhandle.  If worms and flies and ants are conscious and in the same \nsituation as human beings, the bonds of sympathy and forgiveness are \nuniversal. In \na world thats alive and developing, new knowledge is always possible, \nand imagination has the prophetic function of reporting the trends and \nprocesses of development, illuminating the paths toward the future.  \nReason is subordinate to invention and discovery. The \ndualistic conception of matter as distinct from energy and consciousness \nis a constrictive illusion put in place by the forces of empire, and \nthe living reality would be freed from the inert husks of the wrongly \nconceived natural world, when in the future the world was freed of tyranny.  \nAfter Blake, it would be nearly another century before others would \nsee that the crude materialism of Newton and the Natural Philosophers \nwas essentially a life-denying culmination of the worst trends of official \nreligious dogma. A \ncomplete survey of Blakes references to Christianity would be voluminous, \nand not all of them are immediately clear,and require a careful placing in the context of the ideas that were \nbeing discussed in London at that time.  But its hard to reconcile \nthe common description of him as a mystic with his reference to Old \nNobodaddy aloft, or with his comment that Jehovah gives us a knock \non the head, and Jesus soothes it.  He always defines god in human \nterms, so from the conventional viewpoint, he would probably be considered \nas an atheist or pantheist, but he didnt describe himself or his \nfriends as atheists.  When people called Tom Paine an atheist, \nBlake defended him against the charge.  Other friends, Mary Wollstonecraft \nand William Godwin, were sometimes called atheists, but in their writings, \nthey never expressed very unconventional religious ideas.   \nWhen we recall that in the early 1990s, George Bush expressed the idea \nthat atheism should be illegal, it is easy to imagine that people in \n18thcentury England wouldnt have felt that it was safe \nto be called atheists. In \n1803, Blake apparently said something like damn the king, while \ngetting a drunk soldier out of his yard, and was tried for sedition \nor treason.  He was acquitted, because his far more scurrilous \nwritten comments hadnt been published, and it didnt occur to the \ngovernment to look for documentary evidence to support their case.  \nThe fact that he printed his own work, and sold only a few copies of \nhis books to affluent friends, probably saved his life, but it accounts \nfor his obscurity during his own lifetime. Tom \nPaines writing was published and widely read in prerevolutionary \nAmerica, but he was considered a criminal in England, and Blake was \ncredited with saving his life by helping him escape to France.  \nPolitically and ethically, Blakes writing is similar to that of Paine, \nGodwin, and Wollstonecraft (often called the first feminist), \nbut his language is usually more vivid.  It was probably the clarity \nof his political opposition that made his work unpublishable during \nhis lifetime.  The first complete collection of his work \nwas published in 1927, and until that year, very few people had seen \nmore than a few of his most famous poems. Blake \nprinted his work by hand, without a press, by writing the text backwards \non copper plates, surrounded by his drawings, and then etching away \nthe surrounding copper, so that the image remained elevated, and could \nbe inked and printed as if it were a wood-block.  If he hadnt \ndevised this method for printing a few copies of his books, it isnt \nlikely that much of the work would have survived. Shortly \nafter the French Revolution, William Wordsworth was associated with \nthe Blake-Wollstonecraft-Godwin groups defense of the revolution, \nbut he moved away from the ideals of that group, and adopted more socially \nacceptable ideas.  He finally became Englands poet laureate.  \nLiberty, equality, and brotherhood were replaced by blandly conformist \nideas. The \ntype of individualism that Wordsworth came to advocate was interesting \nbecause it was a rejection of exactly that part of Blakes belief \nthat Blake considered to be the essence of Christianity, namely, forgiveness, \nbrotherhood, and bonds of sympathy connecting all beings.  In its \nplace, Wordsworth adopted a memory-centered doctrine.  During Wordsworths \nlifetime, his ideology was exceedingly successful, but its rationalistic \novertones have kept it tied to the past;it had nothing to offer \nthe future.  I think we can get some insight into Wordsworths \nmind by considering that, on the basis of reading BlakesSongs \nof Innocence and Experience,he decided that they were written by \nan insane person.  (Blake was aware that slow-witted people, who \ncouldnt follow unconventional thoughts, often considered him to be \ncrazy.} Everywhere \nin Blakes work, it is clear that he never underestimated the possibilities \nof the future, and never imposed false limits onto anything, but he \ndidnt tolerate vagueness or empty abstraction.  Sharp definition \nwas essential, and unique particulars were the basis for beauty and \nknowledge. For \nBlake, the dialectical principal was a feature of the world itself, \nbut it also informed his method, his technique, and his rhetoric.  \nOne of Blakes powerful insights was that intellectual clarity is \nachieved by contradiction, opposition, contrast, making distinctions \nas well as comparisons.    The principle of intensification \nthrough opposition had special features when it was developed in his \npainting and writing.  Blake gave much of the credit for his style \nof thinking to the process of spending thousands of hours in the practice \nof etching.  The image you create in the conventional etching technique \nis made when acid bites into the lines that will be inked;in Blakes new technique, the image is made permanent by the acids \ncorroding away of everything except the sharply defined image.  \nThe decisive, dividing, line is essential.  Anyone who has spent \neven a few hours of intense effort working in dry-point or etching understands \nthat, when you stop, the appearance of  the world is altered by \nchanges that have taken place in your eyes and brain.  Often, his \nmetaphors are literal imaginative insights that have great generality.  \nThis kind of knowledge distinguishes the work of a craftsman from that \nof an academic.  The probability is that Blakes art led him \nto appreciate compatible ideas when he found them,  and it doesnt \nseem likely that he was influenced by them the way an academic \nis influenced by books, since Blake had his own sources that are \ngenerally neglected by intellectuals. Blake \nfound that contrasts made meanings clear, and made language vivid.  \nHeaven and Hell, Clod and Pebble, Lamb and Tyger, Angel and Devil, Greek \nand Jew, Innocence and Experience, presented contrasts that encouraged \nthe reader to think about the range of possibilities Blake had in mind.  \nHe was always consciously trying to energize the readers mind to \nget out of dogmatic ruts, to look at things freshly, so he often used \nthe polarities in ways that would surprise the reader, ironically reversing \nfamiliar references.  A pious commonplace would be contrasted with \nthe disturbing realities that it normally hid. Both in his writing and \nin conversation, Blake was often playful and teasing, and over-serious \npeople have usually taken him too literally. Academic \ncommentators are so often attached to their erudite pieties that it \nseems that they cant read English.  In the 18thcentury, \na clod meant just what it means in the 20thcentury, either \na lump of dirt, or a lunkhead.  In the Clod and the Pebble, when \nthe Clod speaks the properly sanctimonious phrases, justifying its oppressed \nmisery with a dogma, we have a clue regarding Blakes attitude, but \nthen he makes it perfectly clear by speaking of Heavens despite, \nliterally, Heavens malice (a concept that appears many times in different \nforms in other parts of his work).  Either the commentators assume \nthat the word despite had a different meaning in the 18thcentury (it didnt), or they assume that Blake made an error of diction, \nbecause they choose to alter the meaning to despite Heaven.  \nJust as judges arent allowed to change the wording of the laws that \nthey interpret, literary experts arent allowed to rewrite texts to \nmake them better suit their interpretation. The \nsame insensitivity to the world of concrete experience that has allowed \nso many commentators to read their own ideas into Blake, ignoring what \nhe said in plain English, makes satire and irony and sarcasm inaccessible \nto many people who otherwise seem intelligent;this is especially \napparent when scientists comment on literature.  Forming an imaginative \nsynthesis of the writer and his meaning requires mental flexibility \nand energy, rather than just analytical acuity. Everyone \nwho described Blakes physical appearance remarked on his large head.  \nBlake commented that he didnt like to travel or undergo physical \nstrain, because of its effects on his health.  The brain is an \nenergetically expensive organ, which consumes large amounts of glucose.  \nA very large brain puts a special burden on the livers ability to \nstore energy, and is likely to make a person conscious of physiological \nprocesses.  Blakes descriptions of the process of seeing show \nthat he was integrating his experience into his knowledge, describing \nbrain physiology, incorporating his perceptions and the best scientific \nknowledge that was available to him, into a philosophical description \nof the place of conscious life in the world.  The pulsation of \nan artery was the unit of time, a red blood corpuscle was the unit of \nspace, enclosing eternity and infinity, eliminating arbitrary and abstract \nentities, and placing human life within cosmic life, while revealing \ncosmic life within the individual. The \nidea of a biological cosmos seems strange only when it is considered \nagainst an ideology which maintains that life is alone in an immense \ndead universe.  The assumption of a dead, unintelligent, randomly \nmoving physical world is the creation of a series of  theological \nideas, which Blake perceived as essentially Satanic.  Blake used \nthe language of these theologies, but inverted them, showing the ways \nthey were used to obscure reality, and to impose a perverse way of life \nonto the living world. Fred \nHoyle, the astronomer, said If this were an entirely scientific matter, \nthere is little doubt from the evidence that the case for a fundamentally \nbiological universe would be regarded as substantially proven. (1989) Over \nthe last few decades, biologists feel that they have established the \nbiochemical unity of life, in which biochemical cycles and genetic \ncodes are widely shared.  The idea of ecological interdependence \nhas come to be recognized as an essential part of life, or (as demonstrated \nby Vernadsky, and suggested by Hoyle) a cosmic principle.  Blake \noften called himself a Christian, and defined Christianity in many novel \nways, as art, love, politics, science, but specifically, in his version \nof Christianity, forgiveness was an essential idea, and nothing lives \nfor itself only.  Blakes Christianity as Art was a concrete \npart of living, and he ridiculed some of the abstract theosophical definitions \nof god that were common in his time.  When his remarks are considered \nagainst the background of Spinozistic pantheism, it is the intensification \nand personalization, the avoidance of abstractions that could permit \nthe attribution of passivity or inertness to any part of reality, that \nstand out.  When he said that the world is alive, he meant that \nit is a defect of perception that makes Newtons world seem passive, \nempty, and dead.  A few years ago, a movement that called itself \ndeep ecology tried to absolutize the ideas of ecology;Blakes view of the interactive unity of life was as well thought \nout as any that preceded Vernadskys cosmology. Rather \nthan elevating any of the ideas of Christianity to an absolute doctrine, \nBlake used them as parts of an organic whole.  The principle of \nforgiveness was presented as the appropriate response to a world which \nis always new.  The desire for vengeance comes from a delusive \ncommitment to the world of memory.  Virginity is constantly renewed \nin the world of imaginative life.  While Blake said that you cant \nforgive someone until they stop hurting you, the desire to be forgiven \nindicates that there is an opportunity to resolve the problem. Although \nmost mathematicians and computer-so-called-scientists are committed \nto a rationalistic, past-oriented view of their mental operations, and \nsome scientists accept that ideology along with mathematics, the valid, \ndiscovery-oriented sciences have to be future-oriented.  A first \nstep in avoiding dogmatic assumptions might be phrased as remembering \nwhat you are, a living being, and asking how you know things:The interaction with other beings, exchanging energy and information \nwith the environment, experiencing yourself in the world. Holistic \nmedicine and holistic psychology came into existence as attempts to \novercome the dogmatic compartmentalization of reality that is endemic.  \nWhenever rigidity is a problem, looking for ways to create new patterns \nthat by-pass the petrified pattern can lead to a solution.  Parkinsons \ndisease and other physical problems have been approached using techniques \nof intensified or varied stimulation.  Increased stimulation--even \nelectromagnetic stimulation-- appears to open alternative patterns.  \nMusic, dance, and swimming have been used successfully to improve fluidity \nin various neurological diseases.  Kurt Goldstein (The Organism) \nworked with brain injuries, and found that the brain has a variety of \nways to restore a new balance.  Raising the amount of energy thats \navailable can allow natural processes to create a better synthesis.  \nPolitical and social problems that are culturally determined may follow \nrules similar to those of organic brain disease. Optimal \nassumptions, when assumptions are necessary, are those that dont \ncommit you to undesirable conclusions.  For example, in the 1950s, \nsome people made the assumption that nuclear war was inevitable, and \nmade large investments in fallout shelters, which were conceived \nin terms of world war II bomb shelters, and so resources were diverted \nfrom other investments, such as education, which didnt in themselves \nforeclose future possibilities.  Self-fulfilling prophecies and \nself-limiting assumptions are often built into supposedly practical \nactivities. The \nassumption that cancer is genetically determined, and the assumption \nthat regeneration is impossible in the heart or brain, are self-limiting \nassumptions that have been immensely destructive in biology and medicine.  \nThere was no reason to make those assumptions, except for the rationalist \nculture.  Physics, biology, and cosmology are manacled by many \nunnecessary assumptions.  The limits of adaptation, the extent \nof lifes potential, cant be discovered unless you look for them, \nbut the sciences have built many artificial limitations into their systems. Avoiding \nunnecessarily limiting assumptions, looking for patterns rather than \nrandomness, looking for larger patterns rather than minimal forms, avoiding \nreliance on verbal and symbolic formulations, expecting the future to \nbe differentthese are abstract ways of formulating the idea that \nthe world should be seen with sympathetic involvement, rather than with \nanalytical coldness. Almost \neverything which has been denounced as teleological has turned \nout to be much closer to the truth than the mechanistic views that were \npromoted as more scientific, and many horrors have been committed \nby people who have said that nature shouldnt be anthropomorphized, \nthat subjective feelings shouldnt be attributed to the experimental \nmaterial.  The surgeons who operate on babies without anesthesia \nare operating on the assumption that any being which cant say Im \ngoing to sue you is unable to experience pain. When \nwe analyze the ideas of chemical reaction equilibrium (burning something, \nfor example), or biological adaptation or growth or learning, and see \nthat they are strictly directional in time (which is the basic meaning \nof teleological), and consistent with Aristotles description \nof causality, we can see the mysticism that has been imposed on our \nculture with the idea that teleological explanations are unscientific. Blake \nwas clearly aware that the reason for making limiting assumptions was \nto maintain control, and to profit from anothers suffering.  \nSeeing that the sadistic assumptions that were put in place to regulate \nhuman life rested on a dichotomizing of soul from body, Blakes correction \nwas to replace them with a unity of consciousness and substance, a living \nworld rather than a dead world. An \nimaginative study of his work has the potential to rouse ones abilities \nand to open an unlimited world of possibilities.  I give you \nthe end of a golden string, Only wind it into a ball, It will lead you \nin at Heavens gate, Built in Jerusalems wall.   Blake \nknew that his work, like anything new in the world, could be understood \nonly by an active mental process. Every \ncommunicative act is original, and understanding it is an invention, \na projection,an imaginative synthesis.We can sometimes \nfinish another persons sentence, the way we anticipate the notes \nin a melody;we predict the intended meaning.  If the symbols \ncarried the meaning in a passive rationalistic way, the person receiving \nthe symbols would receive nothing new.Intellect is a process \nof imaginative synthesis, or it is nothing. Blake \ndevised a system that would make it possible to think about the \nworld without unconsciously making a commitment to the false limits.  \nHe showed, by working within this new philosophical synthesis, that \nArt, Science, and Politics are structurally and substantially interdependent.  \nThe question I asked in the title, can art instruct science? isnt \nthe right question once you see the world from Blakes perspective, \nsince Science is Art, and both must be based on experience and imagination. Blake \nused, in a new way, the things that were available in his culture, to \nreveal the process of creation, on all its levels.  He consciously \nused language in a new way, to free the reader from the stereotypes \nof conventional language.  His methods are relevant, as he knew \nthey would be, for other times and situations.  © Ray Peat 2006. All Rights Reserved. www.RayPeat.com",
